I was just shaken awake by what I thought was someone grabbing the bottom of my bed and shaking it up and down. I went down the hall to the reception desk at the Comfort Inn in Monterey Park and I looked at the night clerk who is usually asleep and said, Did something just happen? Yes, he replied. That was an earthquake. I went back to my room and called Braff Zackton who was already at work in Chicago. Braff ran his earthquake search that he does every 30 minutes and informed me that I just rode a 4.4 in the Greater Los Angeles Area at 4:04am. It seems no one else is alarmed but me! That is completely whack and a first for me. ----- 9:20am update I just got back from breakfast a few minutes ago. Still no one was talking about this event. It\'s the most reported event in a while on the Did You Feel It? web site. Rare breed these Californians. It\'s like ... the whole L-A area got up and went for a drive on the I-5 in a bumpy Rambler Station Wagon at 4am for no reason ... and nobody even talks about it. That is crazy. I literally thought there was someone in my room picking up the bottom of the bed and clipping it to the lift on a Six Flags grade roller coaster. Isn\'t there a T-Shirt for this kinda thing? ----- You might ask ... Why would I would call someone in Chicago about an Earthquake in California? Well, here\'s a little more background on Braff Zackton you may like to read.
People say that i\'m dealing with a lot of anger issues,  I\'m hard to get along with and i can\'t handle when i\'m wrong.  I\'d tend to agree. I don\'t care, but i agree none the less.  i\'m not the easiest to get along with, but only because i\'ve already figured out what works best. If i ask you to do something a certain way, DO IT, don\'t question me, don\'t try and figure out a better way to do it, just fucking do it like i said and be done with it.  I am a total My way or the Highway kind of guy. i\'m not angry most of the time, most of the time my disappointment in the way a situation that i have delegated turns out, manifests itself as anger. so i\'f i\'m appear mad at you, i\'m not, i\'m profoundly disappointed in the way you\'ve handled yourself.   My current room mate was once my girlfriend,  up until last month she was my girlfriend, i guess you\'d go so far as to put the dreaded\'life partner\'label on her. we\'d been together for years, bought a house have a couple of cars, the whole works.  Last month she decides to mix things up a little bit and go in search of a piece of strange.  when she fessed up to her crime, i was shocked and stunned, but not surprised.  i\'m not exactly the picture of prince charming here. I managed to keep my emotions in check, not yell, or scream, or even hit anything.  All i said was\'I\'m extremely disappointed in you\'That was the last thing i said to her.  We\'ve been co-habitating in this house for the better part of 6 weeks now and haven\'t said a word to each other. Until this morning.   over coffee, one simple phrase has completely fixed my problem.\'Fuck You\'came out of my mouth.  i\'m not sure what\'s going to happen now, i\'m not sure i really care. if she feels the need to suck some dick that\'s not mine, i\'m okay with that. She just wont be living in my house while she\'s doing it.
I appreciate the mums for the color and long season they bring to the late summer and fall gardens. I am not particularly knowledgeable about them nor do I care to be...  for me it\'s simply a matter of planting them, shearing them a few times through July 4th (at least twice, but I prefer three if I get around to it), and watching them bloom. I know I should hand \'pinch\' them to help them fill out, but I just don\'t care to spend that much time on the chore... hedge shears work for me and after a bit of time has passed, any stems that were missed will grow beyond the main body of the plant... that\'s when I hand pinch those stems. As I said... I think it\'s time to divide them and spread them about the gardens, so I will go for that this spring.
I\'m sitting here at eleven thirty at night thinking about what to write. I started to write something but it wasn\'t\'Gigglemedicine\'appropriate. I\'m not trying to be funny I want this blog to be natural not contrived but comedy and tragedy are connected. I could go off on a some witty examples: comedy and tragedy like Alien and Aliens, Peter Sellers and Steve Martin the Guess Who and Come back! I think you get it.    I was up watching\'Behind Enemy Lines\'on Spike. I was inspired to play with the premise:\'Apathy.\'I don\'t know if my indifference came from watching Owen Wilson in a War movie or watching the Oilers lose their fifteenth game in a row with three seconds left. But here I am locked on indifference.    I like the premise. If I can get up in a stage and say I feel nothing. That\'s a better place then being the wonky Sea Monkey - that comedian that\'s on auto pilot. I love comedy. Even after all these years I can hop in a 78 Taurus and burn across the prairies . I\'m not worried about the destination. God will tell me the punch line.    I\'ve never really thought about being discovered. And what does that mean? Like how hard was it for that guy who discovered the Moon?\'There\'s Ted he pointed up.\'I\'ve had twenty plus years in Comedy I teach it and I still feel like my big  comedy discoveries  are in front of me- I know what they are: letting go, moving into the unknown, rehearsing, being prepared. I\'ll keep chipping away it\'s right around the corner inside a 78 Taurus.
How many memories carries on this jewel of Submarine. It left London on January 15, 1944 to sail for the Pacific Ocean to join up with the war. It arrived in Pearl Harbor on Valentine\'s Day, the most romantic day, where you will think about the loved one, while you need to face an incoming war. The crew onboard was prepared as much as possible for the dangerous experience that lay ahead and that they will face during the next days. During that period, for night and days, drills were conducted in the warm waters around Hawaii where torpedoes were fired and gun crews drilled and Pampanito even suffered a depth charging. Exactly one year after, on March 15, 1944, her keel was laid down at Portsmouth, Pampanito left on her first patrol.   I have to say that going inside a submarine for my 1st time was an experiece that I could never forget. You put yourself in a marine\'s shoes. You are inside, the vent-hole is closing. You re going underneath the surface, ready for the battle, not sure if you will see your beloved again. You are there! There is few little space for you to move! And you need to move fast if you do not want to be the bombarded and destroyed!
I was traveling by a public transport this evening of 17th Feb 2010. It was crowded. Hundreds of strangers packed in one iron box(bus). They were breathing over each others shoulders yet complete strangers. People. Thankfully I was sitting by the window seat. While I was looking at the people I was completely taken aback with one thought that hit me. The only thing in my life that I have not seen getting exhausted are the\'people\'. They are everywhere. Every day and every point of a life thriving on this planet. I remember observing and wondering at People when I was a little unknown kid. The old aged people I used to see when I was a kid are still trudging here in gray. The young beautiful girls of teens and 20s are still running around in colors. The little noisy kids are still going to schools and playing in the playgrounds. The mi,\'le aged working men are still tuned with their robotic lives. The shopping, gossiping women are still here. I have been growing up since 24 years and I have seen so many things getting exhausted. The huge green, cool-shaded trees are not seen anymore. The small beautiful streets are not small anymore. I don\'t see an intense rainy season or feel a freezing winter anymore. I don\'t see the radiant rainbows arcing a green valley. The childhood days aint here anymore. No more small cozy houses. They are all exhausted. But people are still here. They are everywhere. Everything has changed but for the people. Thousands die everyday and millions every year. But the people are never exhausted. They have become like a layer on the planet. I wonder if God can find a 24year old sand grain on the beach.
I started this blog back my junior year of college. I worked at a college radio station and wanted to use another way to show my passion for college football and the Fighting Irish of Notre Dame so I started this. Why the misspelled\'tho\'you ask? Anyone who knows me well knows that I strongly represent the\'spell check\'generation and struggle at times with common spellings of words. Just a little play on words, enjoy the site and let me know if you have anything for me. Thanks for checking it out.
Last weekend on a sunday i took my wife who had just arrived in UK for a 3 week stay, on a double date with my best friend and his significant otherhalf. Ben and I took our ladies to see Cinderella on Ice, choreographed and performed by the Imperial Ice Stars, on a tour in UK for their last show that evening. Personally, whilst i was really impressed with the magical performance, the fact that i was seeing a show at the Royal Albert Hall excited me far more. I had yet given my another first time to her.  Lucky for us, as we arrived at the venue we happened to come across with a ground staff for directions, who pointed us to the helpdesk for an upgrade of our tickets for better seats; hence our getting the best seats in stalls for the price of the back row balcony seats, which wouldn\'t be too bad either.  As the performance went on i was wondering how figure skaters could spin 100 times at x Gs and still managed to smile and kept steadfast on the ground, well balanced on the skates afterwards?  As always i could not sleep over this anomaly as a result of not knowing, so i reached out to find an explantion:
After falling in love for Art and Photography I decided to open this Blog. I moved from Italy to Holland in 2007 for my studies, trying to find my own space within my Soul and my H-earth. This blog will be my creative expression while living here and will create new ways of seeing the Earth through the eyes of my Hearth.
I\'m not saying that America is this terrible disgusting country. Well I\'m not completely saying that. What I am commenting on is the the patriotism of American\'s that seem to always offend other countries when speaking of how great America is. You don\'t see African\'s saying look at those Indonesians starving bastards! No because it\'s almost like the pot calling the kettle black.
I have known Delbert for a solid 10 or 12 years now. We met at F.A.B. Church (Then Niverville M.B.) in Sr. high youth group. Delbert stands a full 6\'5\'tall (and as such is one of the only people I know who is as tall or taller than I am at 6\'4.5\'). He is 26, has dark hair which already has a fair amount of grey (likely from all of the crazy stunts he\'s pulled), a missing tooth on his upper jaw with a denture that he enjoys weirding kids out with, and enough experience doing so many different things that you\'d think he had lived twice as long. He\'s currently engaged to be married to an awesome girl named Christina in June of this year, and has made the mistake of inviting me to be his\'best\'man. Delbert is best known for his hunting/fishing/camping expeditions, his adventures in Paraguay, his stint as a drummer in a fizzled rock band, and his ability to smoothly transition from a full-bore cowboy get-up to a pea-coat and dress shirt in the same day. As one of the only people that my son Rhys has listed as a friend, Delbert has most certainly found himself on the VIP list with both of my kids. They can always count on Uncle Delbert and Aunty Christina for awesome gifts at Christmas time. Two of my favourites have been my son\'s Carhart sweater, and my daughter\'s pink cowboy boots and hat. Truly stellar gifts from both a parent\'s perspective, and the kid\'s. Del does the same thing that I do for a living: carpenter/cabinet installer. He\'s pretty well respected by both the company he contracts for (Kitchen Craft), and his clients. If there\'s one thing I\'ve noticed, it\'s that he is a hard worker, and a really great guy to know if you ever need back-up. When I bought my house in October, 2 years ago, I did some major renovating before we moved-in. Delbert just showed-up on the first night with a case of beer and a tool belt. He pretty-much was there for the full rest of the three weeks, working almost as much as I did, no need for me to ask. He\'s done a lot of things like that for a lot of people. I don\'t know any other guys who would do that, and that\'s maybe as much as I need to say. Here\'s to Delbert (I am drinking a beer right now, and lifting it in a toast).
I am a 34 yo husband, father, health care practitioner and traveler; though not always in that order. Born in FL, raised in NY, grew up in AK and now reside in WA with my wife of 10 yrs and 2 children. I have been working in Alaska in the same field for the past 11 yrs and I still love my job. I know I am very fortunate to go places, see things and meet people that many people will never get the chance to experience.We arrived to Adak Island on September 28 and I can literally count on one hand how many nice days we\'ve had here.  Yesterday the most recent and even though it was cold, it provided a nice clear day to take some photos.  The first shot is 6 photos stitched together for a panoramic of the town of Adak.  The other 2 photos were taken after capturing a dozen or so still shots of the young eagle.  I stood and waited for about 20 minutes waiting for it to fly off so I could capture it in flight.  I almost missed too, but the wait was worth it.  Adrian and I have one more week here before we fly back home for Christmas with the rest of the family.  I hope to get one more nice day to get more photos of all there is to see here before we return in January when there\'s sure to be a lot more snow a lot less time.  We\'ll have less daylight and a,\' to that A season for Cod fishery and Opilio crab.  It\'s bound to be a busy time at the clinic.  Hope you enjoy the following pics.
Well, I\'m back from the outer space that is the holiday season. I trust you all had a great holiday?  Relatively uneventful on my end - just some good times with friends and family and usually a few drinks to close out the night.  Most interesting part of the holiday was that Mrs. Shambles\'s grandmother is in a nursing home right now. And when we visited her, the woman she\'s sharing a room with, separated by a curtain, kept asking us (apparently Nancy and Bob) how the food was in Jamaica and how big the plane was and why we kept talking about Cincinnati when she knew that we lived in North Olmstead before we went to Jamaica, of course.  When we said we lived in North Carolina before that, she got totally confused.  Oh, and that one of my relatives may soon begin smoking weed due to a medical condition.   And it was snowing and I\'d had little sleep and a sugar free Red Bull, but driving back home I either saw the body of a giant sheepdog or a small Yeti.  So I guess it was a little interesting.  I wish you all the best in the coming week and year!
..The republicans are the only thing standing between Obama and a socialist 3rd world America. The health care bill is a fiscal nightmare and bodes ill for seniors. The majority of Americans don\'t want it else it would have already made it through; it is the die hard loyalist to Obama who cling tenaciously to a bad idea and are unwilling to let it go. Michelle I am heartened by the progress you have revealed your sister has shown. I believe eventually you will find a way to get help for your sister. If you were in Canada or England with their socialized programs you definitely would not have a shot and would be trying to figure out how to get to America to maybe have a shot. If that bill gets through, opportunities for resolution of complicated issues like yours will be impossible to resolve.
This is something that I have never really belonged to personally. I also think for the most part anyway this is a problem on a much smaller scale compared to the last couple topics, that eventually dissipates after leaving your high school/juvenile days behind. Yet still grouping people, labeling people, and then bashing them for ludicrous reasons is discrimination in it\'s child hood stages, and can still cause damage to others. I have seen first hand how the\'popular crowd\'really works. You\'re in, or you\'re trying your best to get in by doing everything necessary to gain acceptance. These people that try to get into these crowds usually have low confidence in themselves and will attempt to show off by insulting or belittling a different classification of person, for example\'nerds\',\'emo\',\'outcasts\', exc. Sometimes it could also just be the\'popular\'ones themselves that try to hurt others. This is considered small drama, but drama people have to live with as long as they go to school. So, something like this to the victim of this drama will build up over time...there\'s your damage. Not fitting in when you\'re desperate to, and being bashed by the desperate year round. I do realize high school isn\'t this kind of hell for everyone, but I\'m speaking for whom this concerns. There will always be secrets, rumors, and backstabbing especially if you work your way up brutally, that\'s exactly how your\'friends\'and social life will be.  Also another thing I would like to point out is school shootings. School shootings are often caused by these actions of immaturity. Again, if you\'re mean or unfair to someone consistently, it will have a terrible effect eventually. All it takes is for that person to get to their breaking point. It doesn\'t always have to be a school shooting; they also sometimes just kill themselves, or release their stress in many other ways. To close this up I just want to say for the wanna-be popular bitches and bastards, get over your minor insecurities, and lack of imagination or someone will get hurt!
Banksy and the Bristol Museum have recently unveiled a ground breaking installation that features a ton of new work from one of the greatest working artists in the world today. I am seriously considering making the trip to check this one out...it looks absolutely stunning. Just watch these videos and you\'ll see what I mean.
People who know me well know I love baseball. I love the sounds, the smells, the nuances that make the game different than any I know.   It\'s the one game that allows those with less talent and athletic ability to prevail over those with more of both through dedication, practice, patience, and desire. It\'s the one game that measures the person in a way that crosses over into real life.  I coached for a number of years. What I remember from those days isn\'t wins and losses, but the kids, their personal fears, their smiles, their triumphs, really everything about them.  One person in particular was Peter. He was kind of a fringe player, but did his best. During one game, he missed a fly ball. He broke down in the outfield and started crying. Quickly, I sent in a substitute and met him as he came off the field.   He needed a hug, and that\'s what he got, right in front of the whole world. I told him I was proud of him. I told him he was good. And, I sent him back in the game. Redemption, just like that.   In all my years as a professional, I\'ve never had a moment like that.
While Dad is busy with my little brother in the bathtub John and I decided to try and see what we got for Christmas!  I told John to wait at the dining room doorway to let me know when Dad comes out of the bathroom while I checked our presents. I walked into the den and saw them. WOW!! There are lots of presents here!! I started looking at the presents trying to find one with the name \'Matthew\', my name. I found one! Please let this be the Wii I want! I hope so! Turning it over I saw that Dad learned his lesson last year with me peeking at my gifts. There was so much tape at the ends I couldn\'t peek at it without ripping the paper right off! Shoot! Maybe this is the only one. I started checking the others and saw the same thing. Shoot!   Then I heard John behind me when he yelled\'WOW!! Look at all the presents!!\'I turned to John and told him he is supposed to be watching for Dad.\'But its not fair! I want to see what I got too!\'he said. I told him that Dad has them wrapped so good I can\'t see what we got.  That was my mistake. After John yelled we should have gotten out of the den and back into the living room but we had to stand there looking at the presents and arguing. The bathroom Dad was in is across the house but he hears everything we do!\'BOYS!!!\'Crap! There was Dad holding Ian standing right behind us. I knew it without looking. That man can see through walls and has super hearing! I turned around to face the music.\'Boys, if you keep this up I will start giving away presents and I will send Santa an e-mail telling him what you guys are doing. So get your bohunkeses back into the living room or to your rooms. I don\'t care which but you aren\'t allowed in the den right now.\'I caught Dad putting together presents last Christmas Eve so I knew he was Santa but he threatened me with no presents for 2 years if I told my brothers and sister that he was Santa. I know some of his threats he doesn\'t mean but this one wasnt a threat, it was a fact!   So we went to John\'s room and sat talking about our presents. One more week! I\'m not sure if I can make it!!
Some rooms were empty of souls. They held apparatus, desks and chairs, straps. Organized neatly and forgotten this was where monsters were born. In those rooms, those forgotten rooms, the men and women of the crisp uniforms slated their lust on one another gutting their appetites salaciously. They gave no care to vow or matrimony worshipping their flesh on the altar of their uniforms. Bent lines and grinning death\'s heads, blood and silver shining brightly on the horizon of arm bands and lapels. Superiors turned a blind eye to these diversions.  Outside, passing these pores, down the flanks and near the edge of the building\'s furthest corner two soldiers hovered over their cigarettes. Smoke hung like great thoughts of suicide.  \'I hear rumors,\' one soldier said to the other. \'Some are saying you have a whore locked away for your personal use.\'  The other pulled a long glowing drag from his cigarette. Smoke tumbled from his nose and he breathed out fumes from casually pursed lips.  \'What of it?\' he asked dismissively not looking at the other. \'These are rumors. So what?\' he said with a shrug.  The other leaned in close. \'You know it is against the law to bed these filthy animals! You know a child produced this way would only be partially human! Can you imagine?\'  He pulled again on his cigarette, heard paper crumble into smoke under his inhalation.
Lady Gaga has appropriated many many things in her music career (the most controversial of which I won\'t get into because that\'s otro veinte pesos). One of the most striking is her appropriation of filmic techniques and the visual aesthetics of different filmmakers, including David Lynch, Stanley Kubrick, David Cronenberg, and Quentin Tarantino.  This appropriation can either be interpreted as cheating (\'She\'s just stealing from other people!\') or as refreshing (\'Yes!\'). I, for one, am delighted to see a recording artist who relishes and takes part in the construction of her own music videos.  Basically, what I\'m trying to say is, Lady Gaga for SGA President. I\'ll leave you guys with this:
In order to figure out the market and where you should set the price there is the basic supply and demand graph. (Red is supply, blue is demand)  This makes sense if there is more of an item, people will want/need less, so the price will have to go down to so people will again be enticed to buy and than the supply will go down creating a demand so what follows is the price going up.  While there is many other flaws I will focus on the idea of Demand.  What you may not have realized is that the idea of demand gets down to the social-psychology and the very nature of man. --or maybe you did think of that--  Demand is: how much of a specific commodity can be sold in a definite market in a fixed period of time. Generally this is quanitified  In order to measure demand A) the commodity in question needs to exist B) the commodity needs to be in play in that market for that fixed period of time.  Often the idea of demand is paired with something like food, surely food is the oldest commodity and is present in every culture and market on the planet. BUT everyone values food differently and it is only partially paired with our biological need to eat. Crazy?  From my experience (maybe not yours) I have met picky eaters, I have met healthy eaters, I have met meat eaters, and vegetarians, and those who like mexican and german and italian and ---you get the idea. Our demand for food is not just our body telling us to eat, its our\'sense of self\'telling us WHAT to eat. Yes, even our demand for food (at least in the modernized countries) is simply a product of our socialization and how we percieve reality. Demand has little relation to supply except for percieved scarcity and also a social constructed desire for that commodity.
I am going to share with you something that I experienced this summer that made me realize that life isn\'t short, it\'s just delicate.  When I got home from school for the summer this year I only had a few days to relax before I started a job that my brother was gracious enough to bestow upon me. The position was as a safety representative/site supervisor for a general contractor that was renovating an existing structure into a Bed Bath & Beyond. The title was a bit of a glorification as my knowledge of construction is limited. However, I caught on quickly enough to hold onto the job that nepotism acquired for me.  The first thing I learned was that the hours for this position are long. I was waking up at 5:45 am to get to work for 7 (It was a bit of a shlep to get there) and usually working till about 4:30 or 5, sometimes I\'d be there until 6 pm. The kicker is that much of this industry employs a\'hurry up and wait\'strategy so much of this time was spent...well, waiting. Other times I was so busy I wished that there were 4 of me to get everything done that I needed to. Regardless of the type of day I had I was always ready for bed when I got home.
Upon entering the actual classrooms, we are confronted by an array of computer work stations, each one with 3 or 4 computers on it.  They assign all 3rd and 4th block students a computer in each station, and they have to work together to complete their assignment.  Again, I\'ll go into blocks shortly.  Next to this, is a small theater where they show movies and such to students, and also give lectures.  While it is nice to have it there, in their current location, it looks more like a temporary set up.  I assume this will change in the near future.  After the theater, there is a long hallway that is filled with past works they have done, including story boards, screen shots, character designs, etc.  At the end of the hallway is the 1st and 2nd block classroom, where each student is assigned a computer, which all face a screen at the front of the class.  This lets them see what the teacher is doing, so they can copy it on their own computer.  All of the computers in this school are PCs, and while they recognize that both Macs and workstations are prevalent in the industry, they find it is more affordable and standardized to just use PCs in the classroom.  They will even help a student build a PC, if they want one in their home. Next door to this, is the mocap studio, which doubles as a green screen.  Here, they have a full sized green screen room, where half the room is a green screen, complete with props and computers and monitors.  They also have a series of mocap cameras in the room, about 20 I believe, to track movements of anyone wearing the mocap suit.  This is the same mocap system that was used in Monster House and Polar Express. Other than these main areas, they also have a small reference storage area, full of varous reference materials, props and toys all over the place, offices for faculty and staff, a small sound room, and a meeting room I could not see, cause there was a meeting in it at the time. Now, the entire school lasts for only 1 year for each student (assuming they don\'t fail).  Each year is split into 4 blocks, which are 3 months apiece.  A student is assigned wither night or day classes, which stays that way for the entire year.  Meaning the faculty have to change which times they teach classes every 3 months to accommodate the new recruits.  In the first block, you are bombarded with information, most of which is 3D modeling.
I like to think of myself as a creative individual, though at times I become frustrated with one or more of my endeavors. I find myself to be quite capable as a writer, instrumentalist, poet and you name what else, but drawing anything with a direct intent has always been something that eludes me.  My typical art, originally conceived of as a method to stay awake in history class in high school, manifests itself in the form of a variety of swirls, reflective spheres and curved and jagged triangles, such as this: Photobucket  While at dinner some point last semester, I was diagramming a ludicrous plan to place magnifying glasses into orbit which would focus the sun onto an equatorial ring of solar panels that would power the entire world. I was struck by the resemblance of the positioning of the lenses to eyes which inspired me to finish the sketch off of a man made entirely of planets. Despite the fact I probably have lost the napkin, I do have this sketch I drew while in the calculus class I was taking that semester:
It really was just a bag of bones on the catwalk. Young bones. Good looking bones. But bones nonetheless. Living skeletons strutting their stuff in the name of fashion.  Why is it that fashion designers use shapeless, skinny women to show off their wares. They were there in Paris Fashion Week, last week and there they will be in all the other fashion weeks in Europe, and I have no doubt it is the same in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Toronto and anywhere else where expensive women\'s designer clothes go on show.  Clothes for the rich are not, apparently, made for normal women. Women who are woman shaped, with waistlines, boobs, legs. Women like you. Not living skeletons who live on crackers and lettuce leaves.  I don\'t actually know any women who look like that and, frankly, if I did I would be tempted to stuff a few good burgers into them along with several portions of fries. Ok, so its junk food but if you are that skinny you need something to bulk you out a bit.  More seriously, of course, is the fact that too many teenage girls on both sides of the Atlantic view these women as role models. They envy their status. They envy their earnings and they envy the glamour.  They don\'t care about the cut-throat nature of modelling, or just how difficult it is to become a Kate Moss, Naomi Campbell or Cindy Crawford. They just see the glamour.  And if the way to a glamorous career is to be slim, so be it. And that is the trail they go down. Missing meals; an obsession with weight; starvation; even to the point of lying and cheating to conceal the fact they are not eating.    Inevitably the result all too often is one of the slimming diseases that need medical intervention. Sadly, even that is sometimes too late and girls and young women die.  Die in the name of glamour, of being cool and slim.  Die because the fashion industry persists in showing women that are completely untypical of women who walk the streets, hold down jobs and bring up families.  It is time to celebrate real women   woman who are egg-timer shaped. Women with appetites. Women who are proud of who they are.  Which is not to say that being overweight is normal or cool either. It isn\'t. We are talking about extremes here. Both are bad and both are potentially life threatening.   I should know because I was somebody who was overweight because of giving up smoking. This week I am celebrating losing a total of 47 lbs to bring me to 210lbs   still overweight but I am getting there.  It is time to start a campaign for ordinary women. Maybe T-shirts or badges proclaiming \'I am normal\'. It is certainly time the fashion industry began showing normal women on the catwalk and maybe even making clothes that the girl in the street is likely to wear rather than the bizarre creations they sometimes come up with.  You must have seen them on TV.  Garments you would not be seen dead in   even at a fancy dress party. Certainly not clothes you would go to work in - not unless you want to make a name for yourself.  So let\'s hope our young women find themselves new role models to admire. Women who have achieved things in life; in business; in sport and not on the catwalk.  Most of all it is time to relegate the bag of bones to the cupboard of history.  Which is where they belong.
I have become full of hated. As if I am 12 again. It us a terrible feeling. I want to be irresponsible and stupid. I want to hurt certain people. And I want to ruin lives. Including my own.  You were that needle that broke my god damn back. And all of the sorries in the world couldn\'t fix this. I have become so upset, that I want to insult you. And emotionally hurt you. But, that is not who I am. But, I am fighting myself to not just do it.  You have made me sick. You know who you are. And you may never see this.  I feel strongly enough to say that I might hate you. Fuck.
When I was a teenager I had a guilty secret I thought nobody knew about. It was hi,\'en under the bed where I believed nobody would find it.  It was porn.  In those days porn was not something you came across every day. It had to be searched out. It had to be passed from friend to friend in brown paper, getting ever more dog eared as time went on.   And when Lady Chatterley\'s Lover was finally allowed to be sold uncensored in buttoned-down Britain the \'interesting\' pages were very much the worse for wear. It was an era when sex was not something most people talked about and porn was considered completely outrageous.  And to many people   free thinking ‘normal\' people - it still is outrageous.  In just a few decades society has moved from a position where family life was sacrosanct and children had to be protected from \'adult\' images and philosophy to an age where anything goes.  At one time the most squirm-making conversation a parent could have with a child was the classic birds\'n\'bees ordeal. Times have changed since those innocent days. Now, it is the internet porn conversation.  The former, although perhaps a lip-biting ordeal, was at least natural, even moving, passing on the golden question of sexuality to the next generation but the latter is depressing and there is no script because the kids know it all anyway   or think they do!  Because of the internet every home faces a tidal wave of porn whether they like it or not. For at least the past decade the default setting for porn has been ‘on\' and parents are expected to guard children from all manner of imagery.
First, let me thank you for your recent comment on my site as well as your support to my plight. Thank you, my brother. Now, I see you are from Leonville, La. The name of your town has nostalgia written all over my recollections. We used to play Leonville High. We, as in Sunset High basketball team. When everybody on their team was called \'Davis.\' Lol. Those were the days, some 20+ years ago. I doubt you remember all that because you couldn\'t have been any older than 6 or so; before the merger/consolidation of all area high schools - to form Beau Chene High. You know there was a time, when I was about 10 years old or so, when I thought I could save the world. From what or who, I had no clue. All I knew was I was going to wrap a white sheet around my neck for a cape. I was going to gly away in my mind...fight the bad guys in my mind...then fly my \'Louise\' away...just like the movies...in my mind. But, then I\'d conclude that I needed a sidekick and since I had none, my plans were only an illusion. However, when i was a child, I thought like one. Now that I am a man, I\'m called upon to act like one. See brother, black leaders don\'t exist anymore because the influential brothers and sisters are leaders and heroes only in their minds, wearing sheets for capes...looking for a sidekick or fall partner. No one wants to be the positive one, in singular form. I get that. I really do. It takes mean and women who possess moxie to lead. Men and women who are not slaves to corporate influences, or social intimidation. The world watches doers of deeds, not speakers of rhetoric. As a black race, we have placed ourselves back into the wilderness, and no one seems to even notice it. Too busy \'bling-blinging\' until ignorant cataracts have blinded us all socially and morally. I wish, when I was free, that my mind would have been so loyal to reality as it is now. There\'s so much I could have done (would still love to do) to help out our people to see the reality of our existence. See, it only takes one to lead \'some\' in the right direction....you, yes you can be that \'one.\' You don\'t build a house by placing a roof up first. No. You build the foundation from the bottom up. You can start by educating the young. Teach them, and lead them into the realm of truth. And when they grow up, your voice and reasoning will be their beacon of justice and a new revolution that will break the chains of ignorance from our people once and for all. Our future rests in our children. Never doubt that! On that note, take care....I\'m here for you.
I use to think about stuff like this all the time, mainly on trains. I love trains. Those noisy, crammed, and sometimes smelly Boston transit system commutes were my time to drown out everything around me and just reflect on me. Pin drops would echo within the Zen pools of my mind, it was so quiet in there. You can\'t daydream on car commutes; I wouldn\'t recommend it.  During those train rides, I use to think about what truly made me happy, about my relationships past and current, about my friendships, and about my future. I found peace reading and contemplating over the works of Locke, Whitman, and Marquez. And from those uncomfortable subway seats I watched and admired the bustling life of this metropolitan city and the interactions of its denizens. But despite years of watching and reflection, I could never answer that one haunting question: why can\'t I be happy?
A couple of weeks ago, I had the good fortune to attend a unique and powerful gathering of senior HR executives and CEOs at a conference put together by CTPartners.   The conference sought to create(and I thought very successfully) an open and candid discussion between business heads and the HR function to better understand why HR is not viewed as a true strategic player in most boardrooms and what can and should be done to change that picture.  It isn\'t like this subject has not been discussed many times before because obviously it has, but there were a number of things at this meeting that made it very different from others I have attended.
As my eyes were paralyzed to the sky I remember all the movements and formats waltzing through the air to the sounds of laughter and enjoyment.  It was a parade of unique forms drifting higher and higher as strings lengthened and feet marched.  They were human created birds surrendering to the wind and I was a child mesmerized by the fascination known as flight.  And it happened once a year in Franklin Park.  Many gathered and celebrated the art of flying kites.  I can remember sitting Indian style on freshly renewed spring grass trying to fit my tiny mouth around over bloated, slightly burned hot dogs and just watching all forms of kites taking formation in a sky that always seemed so bright on festival day.   My mother\'s boyfriend, Curtis, bought me this huge Superman looking kite and they spent much time putting it together and getting the strings just right.  I didn\'t quite grasp the concept of flying kites but I looked forward to seeing mine lifted as high as it could go.
Now don\'t get me wrong, I am old and wise enough to realise that the temples and funeral service cant compete with the Disney Channel, but I had hoped some of our other excursions would have at least made the top 5   we waded in the turquoise blue Indian ocean with 5 foot wild reef sharks for Christ sake, we watched as wild baboons shoved their big red assess into our faces, and we even drove (unwisely) down mountain passes in a knackered old Suzuki APV to find untouched, unspoiled and unpopulated beaches   drives so scary that even the blondest dumbest Aussie surfer wouldn\'t dare traverse to catch the a ‘radical\' wave. I found myself encouraging them to answer how I wanted them to answer, a top 5 that included spiritual, emotional and evangelical experiences, they seemed bemused at my suggestions. So now as I sit here on my way back to 237 un-opened emails, 40c degree heat, the Olympics and a moody dog, I try to put some logic into why they answered in the way they did. I guess its obvious really, how can a lush tropical Forrest hugging an enormous volcanic calderas, compete with a boy who can change into monsters and aliens? Or how can a barren, wild and deserted golden sand beach beat the graphics, sound effects and monster splitting, head ripping, gut disembowelling joy of the latest PSP game? The truth is they can\'t, well at least not to children brought up with international travel as a given, 3 dimensional aliens as role models, and food that tastes the same and is delivered within 30 seconds of ordering   anywhere in the world, it can\'t.       So whilst I stood motionless during the avalanche of abuse pouring over me, I had time to wonder and contemplate her argument, gearing up for a repost equal to the verbal beating I had just taken. What could I say? Was she right? Had I been directly funding the imprisonment of minority religious leaders? was I responsible for the decline in the traditional Chinese family system? Had I somehow become a key player in China\'s destruction of the worlds sensitive eco system?   I played with responding using the Norman Tebbit philosophy that I was just \'Getting on my Bike\' and finding work to support my family, or even the Nazi war crimes excuse that \'I was just following orders\'. None of these seemed appropriate or relevant, I had left a UK job to come to China, and I was for all intense purposes the boss with no one giving me direct instructions. So I mustered all of my intellect, my years of social grooming, the decades of experience and the extremes of my vocabulary to utter a single word   \'Bollocks\'.
Last Friday, the drama department at my school went on a field trip to the University of Arizona in Tucson to tour their theatre department and watch their production of Shakespeare\'s\'The Taming of the Shrew.\'The drama teacher asked the faculty if anyone could chaperon. I said I\'d do it if my daughter could come along, which she was fine with. So Sofia took a day off of school and we went to Tucson for a little Shakespeare. Since Sofia enjoys drama, I thought it would be a great experience. We had a good time.
You know it takes very little to qualify as being a \'nice guy\' these days.  You pretty much have to just not be a complete prick, and already you\'re higher up the respectability la,\'er than many in this cynical era. If you, humble reader, happen not to be from England and are wondering what it\'s like, then allow me to attempt a description.  First of all, remove the idea that all English people are positively reserved, yet jovial and kind-hearted people. That cliche died almost a century ago.  No, instead imagine a vast expanse of grey concrete and stained, decaying brickwork; its gloomy litter-strewn pavements populated by silent introverts studiously avoiding eye contact, for fear of verbal/physical confrontation or possibly a suicide bombing. In fact the general city atmosphere is now one of island-like isolation. People are becoming ruder, less civil even to those close to them, and some base values of politeness and chivalry have been all but forgotten. \'What\'s he/she after?\' and \'What\'s in it for me?\' are two of the most self-posed questions.  But hey I should be thankful, because it certainly helps increase the impact that a simple good deed or act of kindness has on those around you. Having the words \'please\' and \'thank you\' garner a surprised reaction is a strange thing to observe, but an altogether pleasant one at least.
You\'ve heard the expression\'I\'ve had it up to here (hand parallel to the earth while levitating your hand in front of yer brow)\'It is like we are a vessel that holds negativity, and when there is too much, we overfill and...then... we just plain lose ourselves.   But when positive hits us, the vessel drains.  When I see the level lower, I know that sometime ahead, negative will inevitably be on a future path.  But why let that inevitability lessen the positive?  Savour the great moments, and be prepared to not give the full value of what future negative intends for you.\'If one person can\'t make a difference, then why does it only take one person to ruin things for everyone else???\'----Joel Whitfield
So how do you prepare for a meeting 30 yrs in the making????  I have thought about what I would say to my father if I ever saw him again at least 100 times. Every time it was something different. When I was 13yrs old I would have said\'Who the fuck are you?\'At 23yrs old I would have said\'You have a lot of nerve to show your face\'.. Today at 33yrs old I said nothing. I simply reached out my hand, pulled him towards me and gave him a hug. It seems that over the years I have had time to grow up and understand that holding in bad blood and half the story would only hurt me. I didnt ask what happen between my mom and him. At this point it does not matter. A few months ago my brother disowned me and I am not sure why but what I learned from that was that to have been given a second chance at a relationship with him would have been priceless. It has yet to happen but tonight I was faced with an opportunity to give someone a second chance. I lost a brother but gained a dad and now 2 sisters. We exchanged info and hours of stories. I even got him to leave my mom a voice mail saying hello and wishing her well. I guess he is giving second chances too.   Everybody, this is my dad Mr. Iglesias aka\'The Mariachi\'and yes he still sings.
Well here I go again rambling.   The answers to my questions, the answers that only I can find are found in no other than me. They are deep and imbe,\'ed in my soul that are not easily exposed. Without me searching for these answers we are left to pounder where what and why. So here I sit in wrighting this to dwell in the depth and find myself. I look in every crevous and hole to no avail and realize the answers are not to be revealed. Instead the answers will become clear as life is lived and only if I look forward to the path of my father and live as if I have lived my life forever.
Not everyone will encounter it, and not every soul will feel it as strongly as another soul might, but there is a period of trial that in it\'s depth can almost strangle us. Mother Teresa felt it acutely like a sense of abandonment from God. And others have felt it as a confusion and a deep sense of unknowing. Job encountered it when he lost everything, absolutely everything and sat naked in the ashes with his wife telling him to\'Curse God and die!\'.  I have known some of it\'s sting when lonely and down I have felt like heaven is closed and my prayers are no longer heard. This is the long dark night of the soul. We are not taught of it in Sunday school where all the answers to the questions are\'Jesus\'. We don\'t talk much of it in bible school where the times are good, and the friends are near. God is just around the corner and we are creeping closer all the time. But now out in the world we find it. It isolates, and hauls us off into the places where we would have never thought that we would go.
I grew up on a farm outside Cazenovia, NY and attended Harvard College on an ROTC scholarship. I served on active duty in the Marine Corps from 1989 to 1993, including deployment with the 2d Marine Division to Kuwait during Operation Desert Storm. After leaving active duty, I worked as a mortgage banker and policy analyst/author before returning to Harvard for my Masters degree in teaching. I have taught history and coached track and cross country at Cazenovia high school since 1996. I\'ve been in the Marine Corps Reserve since leaving active duty and have served with the 4th Civil Affairs Group and 8th Tank Battalion in a,\'ition to completing the Marine Corps\' Reserve Command and Staff Seminar and Reserve Component National Security Course at National Defense University. My current assignment as a Marine Historian allows me to combine my love of the Corps with my enthusiasm for teaching and history. I hope this site will help me to share my experiences and perspectives with my students and others.
Greetings.  I do realize that it\'s been some time. I apologize for the irregularity in my posting, but I have again been somewhat busy in my studies. Now it\'s Christmas time again! Consequently, I felt the necessity for a holiday update on my life.  Short version: It\'s been fine. Alternate version: School\'s been good. I\'ve really been enjoying Greek and Biblical Interpretation. My other classes have been fine if not amazing. Next semester I\'m required to start my internship. I\'m not exactly sure where I\'m doing that yet. I\'m contemplating (due to the recommendation of some of those over me) either Palm Avenue Baptist Church (which I\'ve been to once) or The Well (which I\'ve never been to.) I\'d appreciate your prayers regarding both the reduction of my anxiety and for clarification regarding God\'s will.
Just three months from today, while much of the United States is trapped amidst a bleak and gray winter, a bright and warm moment will bring the World together as one to celebrate the passing of one age into an entirely new one. Regardless of whom they\'ve supported in the past, or the cumbersome worries they may carry into the future, the World will unite and look beyond what we\'ve known these past few years. Partisan politics will be forgotten (if just for a brief time) and the World will finally turn the page to move ahead with hope and optimism. Men will weep. Women will cheer. Songs will be sung. Bibles will be sworn upon. Children will be forced to pretend they care.  January 20, 2009. My 30th birthday. It also happens to be Inauguration Day. Either way, seems like it\'s worth celebrating.  Before all that happens, I feel as though there are still a great many things I should do, experience, and accomplish before I exit my twenties. Moreover, I\'m interested in your thoughts and advice as to what you might recommend I do within the next 90 days. They can be big things or little things, as long as they are achievable things (its doubtful that I can win an Olympic medal between now and January).
If you\'re reading this, you\'re no doubt asking yourself,\'Why did this have to happen?\'The simple truth is that it is complicated and has been coming for a long time.  The writing process, started many months ago, was intended to be therapy in the face of the looming realization that there isn\'t enough therapy in the world that can fix what is really broken.  Needless to say, this rant could fill volumes with example after example if I would let it. I find the process of writing it frustrating, tedious, and probably pointless  especially given my gross inability to gracefully articulate my thoughts in light of the storm raging in my head.  Exactly what is therapeutic about that I\'m not sure, but desperate times call for desperate measures.  We are all taught as children that without laws there would be no society, only anarchy.  Sadly, starting at early ages we in this country have been brainwashed to believe that, in return for our dedication and service, our government stands for justice for all.  We are further brainwashed to believe that there is freedom in this place, and that we should be ready to lay our lives down for the noble principals represented by its founding fathers.  Remember? One of these was\'no taxation without representation\'.  I have spent the total years of my adulthood unlearning that crap from only a few years of my childhood.  These days anyone who really stands up for that principal is promptly labeled a\'crackpot\', traitor and worse.
You know life is life you can\'t really chose where it takes you, god has a reason for everything that is the way I look at it. Sure you going to lose those you think you love and those you do, but if it wasn\'t meant to be, there is nothing you can do but love, live and go on about your life. Sometime you get to the point when you have to just stop and think about all the positive things that have happened to you and stop thinking about the things in your life that you have fucked up, or things that have happened to you. My life has taken many many turn\'s some for the good some for the bad, but I am who I am from my past. I have many people that have been there for me throw everything and some that are just there to support me when I need someone to talk to, I am very thankful for those people and you know who you are. But I have to thank my dad for most of it, we have had are times like may may kids but he has never giving up on me even sometimes when he wanted to just drop kick me in the ass for some of the stupid shit I have done, but if it wasn\'t for him I wouldn\'t be the man I am today, if you know who i am u would know that I would do just about anything for those I care about. Some people abuse that to there advantage, but that\'s there own fault. I want to thank everyone that has been there for me throw these ruff times and would do anything for you. But i am going to just say if your no longer in my life there is a reason why and you can just fuckin get over it!
I nearly lost last yesterdays post! Luckily the draft was complete. After seeing Laura had commented on Jasons post, I turned in for the night.I had a long sleep. I would like to have more time before class but i should be fine. I did lose the workI had started on my presentation, and I forgot about my chemistry quiz.  Mmm breakfast.. I just lost connectivity. Gessi posted two new models for me to see. I got some balance transfer cheques! I missed class and have decided to stay home to work on my presentation. Things that I would also like to do: work on my composition, work on my visual art, work on my guitar. I should reward my self with such behaviour. How much work is resonable to have accomplished before setting out to reward myself? I musn\'t over reward.  Finish a section, play a track draw a picture, get back to work?
On to next weeks seminar presentation. I\'m tempted to work on my new composition. I should pick up something to eat. Nice, I found the article Dr. Claxton-Oldfield recommended. Brr, it\'s kinda cold. I\'m sure you\'d suck the nipples off her if you could. Dude! She\'s a cartoon! More attractive than a villain, not quite a hero. Jake did an excellent job cleaning the place. PB and J is devoured. I\'d love to crash right into my bed, but it needs to be made. Yoga class was awesome today. Ah, my bed is made :) Ahh... Orange juice. I should like to eat something more, but what? My internet connection is not being very co-operative. I suppose I should prepare a meal of brown rice and frozen vegetables. I\'m craving something sweet. A bit of chicken noodle rice onits way. I\'ve eaten all of my crackers. I think I\'ll throw some eggs into the mix. Channel your feelings into your work I got my bag paked, washed-up, and I\'m ready to head in for the night. I\'d like to feel good about what I\'ve accomplished this weekend. A part of feels as though this pulled muscle in my back is punishment for something I did wrong. The amount of work I got done in RDA and Social Psych doesn\'t help any. Dominique would count it towards Catholic guilt. Could it be so ingrained? I\'m practicaly caught up on my housework. I wish I had more time to play guitar. Pat Metheny is really good. With any luck, I\'ll be up early and rested tomorrow morning with ample time to get some studying done before class. After class I\'ll finish up my lab and I might spend some time at the gym. On my way home I\'ll pick up some groceries, have supper when I get here, then pick away at the rest of RDA. I might squeeze an RDA session in while I\'m on campas. One day I got through three chapters while I was working in the student center.
I stood, suspended on gossamer words, Trapped in sound and light they span out, simple With gently placed phrasings they could not but call And in these words, and motions, spinning truth A gentler rhythm, a kinder rhyme breathes Out, and in the audience, all air, Stilled, and charged, and frozen in it\'s glory, As upon a platform below our feet But above our minds, in incandescence Framed in motions, truly daring in heart and soulful intent, we are all acting They seem to say, declaring it to us all, Ah, but oh, I hear us all exhaling What beauty in this act, there is, trailing.
The black rock on the left is obsidian I found at a hunting cabin we go to once or twice a year. Obsidian itself I find to be interesting, but in this case, it\'s not just the fact it\'s obsidian that makes it unique. If you look closely, you can see concentric rings on the forward face. This is caused to glass by a hard impact, for example if you\'ve ever seen glass that has been shot with a BB gun. Second to that, this obsidian was found in what had previously been american indian territory very far from any volcanic areas. While it\'s possible it arrived there in another manner, I find it most likely that it had been traded for from a far away place by a group of indians and was discarded in the process of flint-mapping an arrow. Besides this glass being around, there are also grinding holes in many rocks, guaranteeing the presence of indians in the past.  The rock to the right of the obsidian is black and what I see as orange in a striated pattern and was found in a riverbed. The patterning shows significantly better when wet. Besides liking the coloration of this stone, I am struck by its similarity to the flesh of fish.  The next two stones were found at a beach. The one on the left appears to be made of a conglomeration of soft and hard stones and this is demonstrated by the way the stone has worn, leaving protruding bands of the harder yellow stone. The next one appears to be sediment condensed into stone, including shells which cause the white, slightly pearlescent layers. The stone that is not like shell has a green tinge, which suggests it originated from a fairly good depth of populated water.
So once again I have ended a shift at the place i work. It was less than fun and really made my head hurt. Now to my issues. I have found that people suck. I say have a good day and the reply is pretty much nothing. What causes people to be so rude? I am just some guy working at a store trying to make some sort of liveing. So the journey begins. I have started fresh upon this page. My ideas that shall flow upon here for all to see. This is the beginning of my thoughts lets see what dark ally we get lost in. For you have started a hike along the narrow path which is my inner most ideals. Lets see how far my mind can take us.
The gaming world is a fucking flaming piece of shit. I\'m honestly considering trading in my 360.  When I started playing PC FPS games in 1997 it was all about community, respect, friends and fun. I could hop on a server knowing that I was going to have fun, say\'good game\',\'nice nade\',\'great shot\'and in return have the same done back to me.  Now with the release of console games with access to the internet the fanbase of gaming has been spread throughout a wide community of thickheaded kids. Every time I get into a game of Modern Warfare 2 I am greeted in the lobby by hoards of latin-accented shit talkers screaming and not letting anyone get a word in edgewise. There\'s no longer any room for logic left in the game. Kids attracted to games like Halo 3 and Cod: World at War have completely overrun us. The immaturity level is astounding. I was 7 when I started playing online and I still had more maturity than these fucking assholes.  Honestly, if you\'re going to talk shit and act like you\'re better than me, then prove it. Stop being a pub scrub and get your ass into a private game and scrim or 1v1 me. The gaming world is obsolescent.

This Saturday, February 13th from 11-5PM is the first LA Street Food Fest. I will be setting up the Mr Toast booth This is going to be a crazy cool show with 30 food trucks and 30 designer vendors (including our friends Spicy Brown). It is $5 to get in and they are expecting a crowd! It is near downtown at the Center Studios.
Memorial Day. We are here today to remember. To give thanks. To pay tribute. We do this because it is the right thing to do. Our fallen heroes are worthy of our time, our attention, our honor. We also do this to support and comfort the families and friends of those who have made the ultimate sacrifice. We hope to remind them that their loss has paid the mortgage on freedoms we all cherish. Finally, we do this to demonstrate our values as a people; that courage is honorable, that service is essential, that sacrifice will be sanctified. In doing so, we shape the next generation of young Americans.
This is how the weekend started.  I threw on my blue plaid shirt with the green undershirt, the one that makes my chest and arms look bigger than they are.  Then people came over to our place, and we explored the attic space I\'d been too scared to look in since we moved in.  No ghosts.  We took some video and ran voice recorders, hoping to pick up some kind of EVP from our apartment ghost(s?).  So far, nothing doing.  Then we took a midnight (train to Georgia...woo woo!) trip to another friend\'s house.  She wasn\'t expecting us, and we rolled out the welcome banner we\'d made while she poured us some wine.  I drank too much and got kind of silly.  It was nice to visit.  Saturday, Robb and I visited the library in town.  I got some more CDs, and I was pleasantly surprised to see the daffodils (my favorite flower because the portend Spring) poking through the mud next to the walk.  [DSCF0682]  We hung around the apartment, mostly.  It was nice having the boy home for a change, since the ski season is officially over.  So we basked in the homey Saturdayness of the morning and afternoon, and then we headed off.  We stopped to meet friends in Manhattan (not NY) where one of them was working.  Mutual harassment ensued.  Then we went back to her place and met her new friend:
They say Jesus was a good man and an excellent role model for us as modern day society but, as you will see below, I have strong reasons to dispute this.    Assuming that Jesus even existed at all, and going on what I have read about him, I can only conclude that, while he may have had some goodness about him, he was little more than one of many mentally unstable, intimidatory, self-conflicting and self-serving preachers who roamed the hot deserts of bronze aged Palestine and perhaps we should consign his memory to the history books along with Zeus and Horus upon whom, many suspect, he himself was based.   I have decided to be fair though and will respectfully give Jesus his due to start off with. Here are some examples of the few praiseworthy aspects of his work on earth.
have you ever wondered why/some people get high/look up into the sky/pondering the exact day and moment at which they will die/well give it a try/you might break down and cry/realize you\'re living a lie/realizing life does suck/and how many people out there don\'t give a fuck/well some of us run out of luck/lay in on your death bed feel in stuck/lookin into the light/hooked up on life support/tryin to make it through the night/the rich people they got it made/movie stars gettin laid/while some are on the streets just tryin to get paid/well that\'s all I got to say/that\'s it for today/take it as it is or just walk away
Texas has a lot of history behind her, so far as states go. Her icons like Texas rangers, the Alamo and oil lust are known about throughout the world. We Americans have set the world on fire because Texas oil men wanted to invade Iraq.  Texas is an o,\' state. Full of natural beauty and the romance of the Old West, led by a crazy Christian cult that cares more for the rights of the rich than life, liberty and pursuit of happiness of the poor costarring horses and bovines. I really enjoyed the place when I was in El Paso and San Antonio and still miss to this day watching storms roll across the desert mountains off in the distance as the desert sun beat down upon me. Texans see themselves as independent from the rest of the United States, they dwell in a frontier state between Mexico and the US in their collective imagination. A romantic idea to be sure; a respite from the modern world.  The Texas board of education made the headlines today for embracing Christian philosophy while playing down science and set back schooling standards intellectually by about 100 years. Kinda like Kansas did but with more manure. It always gives me pause and makes me wonder why Christians need to try so hard to push their teachings down everyone\'s throat through social programing. If their message had true meaning and power in the first place then they wouldn\'t need to strive so hard to make everyone believe it too. Is their faith so small? Or does this lack of real meaning and virtue reflect their true inner state? Who\'s to say? I do not pretend to know the answer as to why some folk prefer the darkness to the light.
So I haven\'t been eating or sleeping much lately, since my anxiety and my depression been bad I just haven\'t been able to do those two things and I\'m worried because people told me I look much more pale and skinnier, which you would think me being sober would do the complete opposite, I know things will get better it\'s just hard doing it by myself no matter how many times people say other wise I\'m basically alone with my extreme problems, it\'s cool though because in some weird way I know I deserve to feel this way.  It sucks big time because I\'m a little lonely but it\'s cool I can deal with it I just need to keep school a top priority So I can start my new life.  The only real thing keeping me here would be my goals because they are keeping me positive. Also I find it hard not to result to old ways since I\'m so depressed but I have been clean and sober which is good I just look at this time as Gods way to show me that I need alternative methods of being happy with me.. I know I\'ll be ok but I just need people rooting for me..... Also in the pic below it\'s a new sleep tracker app I got and lol last night was the most I had in forever lol I will post more of these because they are mad interesting but hey take a look!!
I keep a pretty good handle on the right wing nutters, but I\'d never heard of S.E. Cupp before today when she was talking about Tiger Woods and plugging her upcoming book Losing Our Religion (which is predictably about how the left wing supposedly hates Christianity).  SE was talking to the Hannity stand-in and expressing her outrage that because Tiger didn\'t come out and say he was a loser, he was a loser. In a tie-in to her book, she pivoted on Tiger\'s comment about his previous and newfound dedication to Bu,\'hism. Of course, that was a\'direct attack\'on Brit Hume who had -a while back- commented that Tiger come to Jesus and get some real redemption and ethics.  And then SE was outraged.\'Bu,\'hism, whatever,\'she raile,\'dBu,\'hism considers adultery a sin too.\'She continued:\'He\'s obviously out of touch with whatever his god is.\'Why do some people look down on Christianity, S.E.? Because of Christian(-esque people) like you. Ignorant, ignorant people like you who do not think any other belief is worthy of fifteen minutes of your time to learn the basics of the phraseology of their system, let alone the belief structure.  To clarify: Bu,\'hism does not have a creator god, nor do they believe in the self-deprecating Christian construction of sin, original or otherwise.  But because she is informed on only one form and concept of religion, she can\'t speak in any other terms, even for 5 minutes. How\'d she write a book about the subject? Jesus!  Here\'s an analogy: Many Europeans think Americans are asses because they expect the world to speak English and most won\'t take the 5 minutes to learn\'please,\'thank you,\'and\'Do you speak English?\'They just talk louder. And that\'s what you\'re doing, S.E. Not smarter - or even smart - just louder.  If you want respect from others, whether other religions or while traveling abroad, begin by showing some. I believe some would call that\'being Christian.\'UPDATE: To clarify, S.E. Cupp is a self-proclaimed atheist. But a bad one. Check the comments for my full opinion.
Now, you\'d think the sight of someone in this condition, slumped over on a chair being held up by two people, among others in a waiting room who had only seemingly incurred superficial injuries would be enough to merit immediate medical attention. However, this was not the case. The triage nurse refused to allow her to skip anyone in line. After a half hour in the waiting room it was clear that my mom was getting worse. My dad is terrible in these situations. He saw that I was worried and like a good dad was trying to quell my concerns with lighthearted conversation but I was less interested in that and more interested with what status my mom might be in in another half hour. With that, I stood up and walked directly through the big swinging doors with large signs saying\'No Entrance\',\'Hospital Staff Only\', and other such signs. I found a Doctor and informed her that there is a lady, my mother, in triage who has not been seen and (in so many words) whose condition resembles symptoms of a heart attack. The Doctor came back with me immediately to see her. She (the Dr.) told the triage nurse to let her register right away, and when that was said the other people in the waiting room...this was after an hour of apathy...verbalized that my mom, who at this point could no longer move of her own volition, could go in front of them. With no beds left in the hospital, this only helped things marginally. In the triage nurses office there was a bed that my mom was able to lie down on. As the triage nurse took her vitals, she smirked an\'I told you so smirk\'and said\'Her vitals all seem normal.\'As if to say\'FUCK YOU\'to this triage nurse my mom immediately began to vomit a bright green fluid. We had to turn her on her side because she wasn\'t able to move and we worried that she might choke. Seconds later, another nurse came rushing in to take control and my dad and I were kicked out of the room. The vomiting continued for about 30 more minutes. We were called in once more about an hour later to help move her onto a bed that had become available and we wheeled her into one of the curtained off areas where the admitted patients wait to be diagnosed. Sometime between then and when the nurse in charge came she shat her pants.  At this point, I was holding my moms hand beside the bed. I could feel it shaking in my hands but slowly the shaking subsided and my mom drifted off to sleep for about another hour (this was after nurses cleaned off the accidental defecation). If we got to the hospital at 6 pm, it was now 11 pm.
I am going to vote on November 4. I never miss an opportunity to cast a ballot. Ever.  I just want to make a quick comment on the state of slander in the Presidential race. I just can\'t imagine how far people are willing to go to make a demon of someone. If you don\'t want to vote for a particular candidate -- fine, but, the fact you aren\'t voting for that person does not make them a devil, the anti-christ, the precursor to the anti-christ, a marxist, a pal of terrorists, etc. on and on. Sickening to me. These are two brilliant, well-qualified men who are running for President. They have both distinguished themselves. They have different views of how to move the country forward. Discuss that. Stay on point. Then, go vote. The one who gets the most votes wins -- and then becomes our President like it or not.
Have you ever been in a situation that was bad for you but at the same time you could not leave? I was in that situation for almost five years. The good news is though, i got out of my situation and can now tell the world about what it was, how i got out of it, and where I am headed.        As this myspace shows, i was in a relationship for almost five (5) years with my now ex-girlfriend. We broke up because the love died, the relationship failed to make both of us happy, and we were left wondering with whom we were to be with in the distant future. So she left me, at first it was hard for me to accept. After being with someone for almost five years, all off a su,\'en its taken away from you. You begin to realize in the beginning of a long term relationship that when it ends it feels like a drug. You feel like you need THAT PERSON just to be happier. I was faced with something I had no control of. It was not like I could go buy her off the streets...no....it was over and that was it. I began to morn my loss. Until my friends and family began to morn because they felt like they lost me!!!! As soon as I realized what I was doing to them and myself I realized that I need to pull through so they could pull through. I IMMEDIATELY snapped out of mourning, and all my life energy went into being there for everyone who\'couldnt do it without me\'so I choose to choose life for myself first, life for them second.      In choosing life I realized life without her was not going to just happen I had to do some of the work. Even if that meant getting out with my friends (and making new ones if you know what I mean ;-)...) Before I started going out solely to meet someone new. We had a first (and last) date to start things off right. It didnt feel right though, you see....we started over so it was supposed to seem (and feel) like we never knew each other. But she was too comfortable around me, and made it seem like we were far from over. I was left at the end of our date thinking\'so where did we end?? How are we supposed to do this??\'It did not feel like we ended however my heart knew and felt otherwise. I had already done my mourning so I got over it in a sense. Our date did not make it help for this respect it just made it worse. So I decided I was done playing her games. I was not going to listen to her anymore. I was and am going to live my life the way I want to. Although I now hate her for those years wasted. There was some love there too that made it all worthwhile. Im going to remember this life lesson and use it for when I find someone else. Nothing in the world is more powerful then that.      The end of a long term relationship is one of the hardest things to let go of if its not good for your well-being. The lessons learned from this though will help me for when god decides to give me a girlfriend (or maybe a wife.) We all have the ability to control our destiny, sometimes though fate has the final say with or without its sense of irony.
I\'m disappointed that I don\'t have this game on tape. Why you ask? Not because of the come from behind victory for the third week in a row (as nice as it would be to watch in the off-season), instead because of the the brain freeze by those at NBC Chicago. I\'m not the only one who saw this, both my sister and my old man sent me text messages from a-far, crying for an answer as to what was going on (in which I had no idea). For those who don\'t know or are unaware, NBC Chicago cut out of the Irish victory on Saturday at a very unoportune time. As overtime began NBC got the ball rolling fine but right when Jimmy Clausen was set to take the first snap of the extra period, a message came across that NBC was joining their previously scheduled show already in progress. Enter roughly two minutes of\'Access Hollywood\'.
I\'ve been working on some new material.\'When you\'re blind aren\'t your other senses supposed to kick in? like Humor? Hey! I can\'t fully commit to a relationship- where\'s my parking spot? I don\'t know what I\'m going off about- Bitter? just a bit. I\'ve been driving through blizzards to perform for twenty years and I\'m headlining at Bunker\'s sports bar Saturday. Yah- I see the obvious Hitler chunk- Bunker! He\'ll forever be connected to bunker\'s. Maybe if he\'d hid in the Attic with the Franks he would have lived a little longer!    What am I on about? I don\'t know. I just ate some porridge and am trying to drag myself to the gym. Good for me! It\'s Lent I\'m not really Catholic I was raised Catholic but every-time one of my Alter boy bu,\'ies hung them selves I became a little less spiritual. I\'m giving up junk food for lent. It doesn\'t seem right- Jesus gave up his life for us and I\'m giving up Nibs and Junior Caramels. My Cross to bear.    Well I\'m watching the Olympics. We spend Millions on a cross country skier so they can finish 42. Alright- I\'m not math guy but if GOLD is a hundred percent return on our investment where does 42 put our investment? Silver is 50% return Bronze 25- fourth 15 See where I\'m going? You finish 42 that\'s the same as some schmuck calling up grandma and saying\'hey I\'m your long lost nephew! can you front me seven mill so I can travel the world for four years and party me ass off and then finish 42 in front of the family! If you\'re finishing 42 that\'s freakin idenity theft!   Investing seven million so a cross country Biathlete can finish 42? listen that gun you have hanging around your neck- you can\'t hit a target twenty feet away! idea- spin the gun around and pull the trigger! Don\'t worry- you\'ll miss! I\'m OUT!
In many ways I\'ve reached a point where I expect at least something of value to be given to me for free. I expect an eBook about your industry, I expect a small SEO suite of tools, I expect... I see where Malcolm\'s distress is coming from - most of the video\'s on YouTube are pretty low-quality to say the least, there are numerous scam blogs that scrape others and are built solely for adsense - the free community publication sites such as suite101.com and on and on are crawling with subpar articles. I could go on. When you make the barriers to entrance easier more people flood the streets. In the case of Iran this is a great thing - in the case of quality novels perhaps not. The one thing is for sure, whether or not it should happen won\'t have a huge effect on whether it will happen. Just because something will look a bit different and requires more work doesn\'t mean its all that bad.  Companies need to be dynamic and constantly changing in attempt to adjust to the dynamic markets and constantly changing technology.
I recently saw a krafts cheese a,\' on TV. The commercial talks about how great kraft\'s is and towards the end it say\'s\'A country is only as good as it\'s cheese, and Ours (kraft\'s cheese) doesn\'t have holes in it.\'Now I know that a lot of people could care less what a craft\'s cheese a,\' has to say towards anything. But to me this really rings\'stupid\'. I\'m glad craft\'s thinks that America is this amazing country. Now of course, I do think that their are few things that actually make this country amazing. First off our education system. Very few places in this world give EVERYONE the opportunity to have an education. I do believe that it\'s American\'s who are growing more stupid everyday, because people could careless weather their children have an education or not. Another thing which makes our country amazing is the opportunities that some are given, most people have the opportunity to do things that in some countries would be impossible to do.
As we all know, Guangzhou is a large city, it\'s very modern, nearly you can find everything what you want here, you can see the high buildings or you can live in the most luxurious house if you are rich enough. Even like this, there are many dreams you can\'t come true here.        Some people prefer to live in a cozy little home rather than in a big mansion, its wonderful living in the village, from here you can embrace with the nature, have a good mood and smiling all the time, what\'s more, we find the inspiration better which it\'s important to our study and work. It\'s so noisy in the large city that we always feel annoyed.        Beautiful village, beautiful mood.
ve been meaning to delve into the concept of\'free\'for some time, but I have been roused to ask a few questions about the issue after reading a recent article by Seth Godin boldly title\'Malcolm is wrong\'which was written in response to Malcolm Gladwell\'s article\'Priced to Sell: Is Free the Future?\'which was a review of Chris Anderson\'s new book\'Free: The Future of a Radical Price\'whew that was a bit of a circle... While there are several great points each author has made I wanted to highlight a couple that I found interesting morsels to chew on. Seth brings forth a great critique of a common analytical framework,\'should we want free to be the future?\'Who cares if we want it? It is. (emphasis mine) Too often when people see change they ask,\'should we.\'When discussing matter of whether something\'should\'or\'should not\'be, we have to realize that often the scenario will exist whether we want it too or not. We must adapt costantly, balance is only temporary. I\'m not necessarily saying free is the future, I can\'t say that I am knowledgeable enough to say either way. I do, however, think that it will and is playing a major role in the economy today it will have devastating effects on those old, static, monolithic companies that refuse to change.
This today would be alright to have on main stream ads or billboards and even TV commercials because it\'s what WE have made socially acceptable. BUT more often than not if it were someone with a lot more clothes on heavier and maybe braces.  Because if two girls like this were kissing it\'d be more unacceptable.   Why is it that a woman can publicly have a relationship with another woman and also be interested in men and it is completely valid and truthful?   While often times if it were two men kissing, or two straight men exploring their sexuality (like many girls do.)  They\'d be considered gay.  So is it a double standard in terms of us allowing woman to  explore sexually anything and we don\'t allow the same for men.  Is it possible for people of every day too put aside the cock blockery bull shit we read in the magazines that say size double D tit\'s and 12 foot cock be what everyone should look for in a person?      I\'m not quite sure if anyone can really just act upon what they want and essentially just DO as they please or who they please weather that mean a guy for one night plays pocket pool with another guy, or a girl play slap happy with her tongue and another girls Pikachu? We\'ve created so many restrictions for ourselves to only play in this little circle that society says is okay too play. I\'ve always believed true rebellion comes from an education and I think people need to begin to educate and talk about something like sexuality and letting it be more of some thing that everyone can explore.  I mean isn\'t that sort of an attepmt at trying to discorver who you are as a person? & since when was that such an awful thing.  Quite an o,\' thought to think about. The idea that everyone if not anyone might look at people weather it was a man or a woman\'for who they are inside\', instead of someone\'s sex. You hear about people who always say\'I go for personality not looks\'really it seems no one really does. How many people do you know that look at someone\'s personality before they look at social status, main stream idea of what\'s beautiful, or even the sex of a person.  Are we only built to not be sexaully attracted to people for who they really are?

As a collector and dealer, sometimes things happen that are pretty hard to believe. Over fifteen years ago, I purchased an amazing Superman Pep cereal advertising sign. As a cereal collector, this is one of those once in a lifetimes finds. I held on to the sign for a number of years but ended up selling it.  Now years later I was able to buy a second one of these signs. I am sure they made a few thousand of these back in 1947. They were put up in grocery stores and then ended up in the trash. But as with all things, a few were saved, and somehow I have had two end up in my possession. This is the reason I love collecting, you get to be a part of recovering a bit of the past and giving it new home.
Shiloh is the story of a girl that endures the Holocaust and struggles to rebuild her life once liberated. The Holocaust is one of those horrific moments in history, one that is simply too overwhelming to understand and filled with such evil and hate. It is difficult to comprehend the depravity that would allow such a thing to happen to one person let alone six million. What I find particularly puzzling is the aftermath. Whole families devastated and yet these people had the courage to pick up what was left of their lives and rebuild. Shiloh is the recognition of this rebuilding. The girl in the story suffers bitter abuse at the hands of her captors. Through the humiliation and wrenching pain the girl manages to endure and, upon liberation, begins to build her life from what was. The story of Shiloh is one that has been difficult to write thus a full novel is simply out of the question! After much deliberation I decicded blogging the story of Shiloh into episodes would be beneficial, would give this story its voice. I hope you enjoy it. Thanks for visiting! --Tim
Something I\'d always wondered about: Why do all of the members of the A,\'ams family have names that are sinister in one way or another except Gomez? Dark associations of Morticia, Fester, Cousin Itt, Thing and Lurch\'s names are obvious. Wednesday gets her name from the line in the \'Monday\'s Child\' poem — \'Wednesday\'s child is full of woe\' — and Pugsley\'s seems like a play on pugnacious or something thereabouts. But why should Gomez get a fairly normal name? A surname for a first name is hardly sinister.   Something I did not know: the members of the A,\'ams family did not initially have first names. Only when the original Charles A,\'ams comics were adapted for the 1964 TV show did the characters need to refer to each other. A,\'ams chose all the character names himself, except for that of the family patriarch. For that one, he was considering both Gomez and Repelli, the former if the character were to be played as Spanish and the latter if Italian. According to the Wikipedia page, A,\'ams left the final decision up to the actor who first played Gomez, John Astin, who chose to play the character as Castilian. Which is too bad, really, because Repelli strikes me as a better name and a better match for the rest of the family members\' unpleasantly themed names. So that explains where the name came from, at least, but not where Gomez came from or whether Charles A,\'ams thought it had negative associations.
Brief: Write a note about Exams. Assigned by a scarecrow-esque human named Kirk Steaggles.  On a couple of a occassions as i walked into the exam hall i would sing \'this is the end, beautiful friend, the end\' from the song \'The End\' by the doors. Kate Bush once sang the words, \'Heathcliff, it\'s me, it\'s Cathy, i\'ve come home, i\'m cold, let me in-a-your window\'. We can all sing (except Lilly Allen [1-0]) but do any of us really know what incident Kate Bush was alluding to? The answer is no. Until tonight!!  Heathcliff and Cathy had gone to Oceana. Heathcliff had got all dressed up in a striped shirt and smart trousers and school shoes and put on loads of aftershave. He had gelled his hair up at random points so it looked really good. He had drunk some bacardi breezers and so was feeling in a fine mood as opposed to the usual mood which led him to stand on the windy moors for hours on end. Not even he knew why. Some say he was waiting for a boat to arrive on the horizon, bringing his lost love home. But due to there being no water near the moors, this rumour seems to be unfounded and was probably started by one of his mates on the football team, \'for a laugh\'.  Cathy was wearing fluorescent clothing because that was the theme of the night. She looked as radiant as a warm radiator on a summer\'s eve. Much alcohol later and after some terrific \'banter\' from the lads, Heathcliff looks round onto the dancefloor and sees Cathy \'getting off\' with someone else. He puts his drink down and storms over, considers punching the boy, but realises he\'s massive and decides against it. He calls Cathy a \'whore of babylon\' and exits the club. He compiles some abusive texts and accidentally sends them to his workplace in his drunken state. He gets a taxi home, wishing later on that he\'d got the bus cos it cost about ten quid to go a ridiculously short distance to his country estate....in the country.
My elder brother was an excellent student when he was at school and at home he was a good brother who took good care of me, thank you, my dear brother, I\'d appreciate it.        Time flies! my elder brother will be father soon, but what he said and what he did were clearly standing in my mind, there was one thing left a deep impression on me, I remembered my brother never used the school bag when he went to school, instead of it he preferred a plastic bag which was used for holding the clothes, it looked very nice and suited him even more......        I imitated him today, I held my books with the plastic bag, and it could recycle for many times. Ha, I hope I am as excellent as my brother.
My life will take A different change for 2010. I plan on leaving AT&T for long term while I plan to join either the Air force or the Army. There I will study what I have always wanted to study which is computers. This year will be a year of study as I call it. It will be to learn what this new life holds in store for me. It will also be a year of getting closer to my family and friends while I am here in El Paso. It will be very hard to leave them. They know who they are. I thank them for everything they have done for me in times of good and it times of bad this year. One in particular (you know who you are) I am going to miss you the most. I plan to spend New Years Eve with her. I want her to be there when 2010 turns for the world. She is going to be my guest of honor for MY New Years 2010. My 24th birthday is the last one here in El Paso. I will enlist in February, probably be in basics by March Or April. May or June will bring my career training. By 2011 I\'ll have a full military career. I\'ll be far away from home to live and do what I want to do. I\'ll be living my life the way I want to though, under no ones control like the way it was before.
After 3 or so weeks in the country, (many for the first time) they had gained the irritating view that they understood the complexities of this extremely complex and mysterious land, and that they could expel their beliefs with the confidence of a local inhabitant to all and sundry.  Firstly Beijing during the Olympics was probably as far from reality as you can get. A bit like landing in a working class street during the 1977 Silver Jubilee celebrations or the marriage of Charles and Diana, anyone visiting the UK for the first time during this period would have thought we were all kind, generous, happy, welcoming, and completely patriotic   if they had arrived several weeks earlier or later   maybe a different experience would have been had? Beijing was a bit like this   a street party for all comers to enjoy (as long as they were from the Chinese Mi,\'le classes or foreign), a party town, brightly decorated with flags, clean streets, painted signs and manicured green areas. People were on their best behaviours, tolerant of visitors and charitable to strangers, Christ even the taxi drivers wore shirts and ties. Secondly, no one can really understand a place, its people, its culture, its history, and its philosophy in such a short period. Of course we all fall into this trap when on holiday   or at least I know I do!
..Stranger,  I\'ve never felt stranger.  Tho\' this is not the last time, it feels like the first time, ever being so confused.  My mind is toxic, it has the cure for everyone else, yet ‘tis a curse on my own  state of mind, state of body, and place of being. There is something deep inside me -- a scab that needs peeling. Letting go of past grievances is something I\'ve never been good at. But at last, my toxic mind is coming to its salvation. It has found, again, its freedom.  Stranger,   Have you ever felt this strange?  Things seem to be speaking from every direction, signs fly from the heavens, and demons whisper from the floor.  That there is somebody, after everybody, that knows the feelings you have; that thinks the thoughts you have, and sees the world as you see -- inside the mind of another, yet so apart there is no knowing of truth? A heart can be broken, but can it be repaired? Heavens no. Hell no. Purgatory . I am there, my mind is a desolate wonderland of cursed thoughts and abhorred desires to feel nothing. Yet, I want something. I wish for all to be good. NO, I wish for myself to be well and to be well unwell.  Stranger  You have me wishing.
Down the hallway, murky with shadows was a heavy door that opened into the esophagus of a stairwell. Descending the stairs led to another heavy door. This led to the outside world.  Outside and across the walkway was the carefully knitted wire with its elegant teeth and its numbing electricity that hissed in the rain. Outside was the ashe grey sky and the snapping cold. Outside was the hard ground crusted over like a scab. Under foot the scab would crackle and crunch, old bitter bones and sun damaged glass. Very little grew here, only the twisted wees and the mold and the rotting fungi. These preferred the shadows, the corners, the folds of the building. Here in the folds as in the folds of a fat man moisture collected and the skin of the building chaffed. A small film of ooze caressed the inner most skin where soil and foundation met.  Walking beside the building with long lazy strides one passes several entrances all leading into a series of passageways or office spaces. Here, within the nerve center information was processed and evaluated. Papers were typed. Numbers were transcribed. Efficient men and women sifted through their work with precision and efficiency, neat and crisp like their uniforms.
You know this has been the most useful internet tool I\'ve ever used. now me being the internet/cp retard I\'ve been known to be, I know that isn\'t that impressive. On that note though look at what you can do with it. you can advertise a band(and don\'t think the record industry ain\'t lookin), but for me I\'ve located so many friends that I wanted to open a line of communication with, and found people I thought I might never talk to again. I\'m so glad i heard of thios fuckin site. To all my friends out there I raise one to you all and toast the connection we will all share for as long as were alive......friendship. and to the people who have not yet become my friend, HELL raise a glass and make a toast to the people that truly make your life shine.
Seriously though, they\'re starting to wind me up. There\'s literally no way of telling if it\'s going to be a nice soft one or one of those ones that isn\'t hard but it isn\'t soft, it\'s just in no-man\'s land. It\'s like it doesn\'t know what to believe anymore (since it came back from Vietnam). And then there are others that are perfectly nice and yellow on the outside but when you peel them they\'re ridiculously bruised and you just feel like saying \'well i wish you\'d told me the truth from the beginning to be honest mate, cos you\'ve wasted everyone\'s time now\'. I might start taking them back if i take a bite and don\'t like it from now on, without saying a word, just placing the banana back on the till with a face that denotes exactly how i\'m feeling.
My facebook has me remember how worthless the people were who I grew up with still are, except the very few, (two out of hundreds!!!), and myspace I have found handfuls of insightful, intelligent, talented, humorous, and invigorating people I thought I had lost, and others I probably would have never met on this planet.  Due to this, I realize I could have done things differently, but that doesn\'t mean more worthwhile.   And with the stimulation of new friends, I have something stirring in my soul that I haven\'t felt for way too long... confidence to achieve whatever the hell I want!  Just thinking about the possibilities possible, makes me feel like the old me that I admired. The old me that was about fun for everyone.  The old me that could find a use of the info I aquired that could benefit all.  The old me that felt good about myself.  Hell with a new me, I\'ll keep the old me.
But I can still react. Paris is Burning is not a good film. Now someone\'s said it; I said it right there. It\'s just not. Livingston grabbed a camera, threw it on her shoulder, and made sure the lens was open as a number of nonwhite, transgendered people talked and vogued. I won\'t get started on intentionality, but I have to say this: Jennie Livingston didn\'t know what she was doing! And, believe it or not, that\'s part of what makes it fascinating to talk about. Because we co-sponsored the event with Honors Humanities, the night\'s focus was on the film\'s characters and culture, and (I believe) less about it as a film. To show you why I think it\'s an important movie to show, but without taking a long time to elaborate, I\'ve instead listed a literal block of film-related questions you might think about the next time you see Paris is Burning. What kinds of contrast do the scenes of white people walking around the city provide? Does the overlayed music somehow influence the audience\'s reaction to these scenes? How does the film\'s structuring privilege certain characters, or does it at all? In what way is Dorian Corey portrayed in the film? Does this influence the audience\'s reaction to her? How can the audience include Corey, the lone critical voice in the film, as they consider the movie\'s framework? What do the white on black introductions mean for the audience\'s understanding of the film? Do they provide a coherent structure? How else might everything have been organized? Should audience members be concerned that Venus Xtravaganza\'s death seems glossed over at the end? What does that mean for how other characters are treated in the film?
I met a friend at McDonalds for breakfast this morning...yeah, I actually got up early on my day off...go figure!  February in Phoenix is like a Spring day in Ohio...I woke up and the weather was cool, but great.  Less then a month left, and I will have lived here for a year, it\'s hard to believe.  Okay, so I met up with Brad, and we sat down and just chatted and caught up with what\'s happened since the last time we met (Which was a couple of months ago, I just see him for a few minutes at work a couple times a week, can\'t really talk all that much then.)  So I\'m drinking my HOT coffee without the lid, and this lady doesn\'t sit down\'Lady like\'on the seat behind me, she just PLOPS down real hard.  Hard enough for me to bounce off my seat and feel the HOT liquid spill all over the table AND my thighs.  (I\'m not an 80 yr old woman, but I wonder if I can sue Mickey Dee\'s for faulty booths?!?...just sayin\')  Brad and I just laughed at the sight of the coffee all over the table, and sopped it up with napkins and continued our talking...and then it started.  Well before\'IT\'started, the lady would get up, and Brad would give me eye contact indicating that she was going to sit down again.  It got to the point where I put the coffee out of harms way...in other words on the other side of the table out of my hands!  THEN it started!...she had to have had a lot of nervous energy, because my seat started shaking, I think to the point of where Brad even saw me bouncing up and down.  (I\'m not even ki,\'ing!).  We decided to move to another table, and I looked back at her, and sure enough her leg was bouncing up and down.  We dumped our trays and sat in a more peaceful environment.  So my adventures in eating at the McCafe!  So requirin\' minds wanna know, have you experienced something similar to this in your dining adventures?
A couple of weeks ago, we went to the casino to watch some shows, gamble a little and hang out with some of her friends.  It was around 5:30 am when we were wating for a cab outside the casino.   She was dressed in her cultural attire, not her workaday business attire.  She\'s Cherokee.  She was wearing a black leather jacket with the long, thin leather tassles (about a foot long) and asked me to dance to the piped music in the foyer of the casino hotel.  So we did.  I just kinda swayed from side to side as I watched her.  She danced, and the leather tassles just swung in rhythm to her deliberate movements.  Grace.  Wow.  At least I thought so.....we were both well under the influence..  I love her spirituality as well.  She follows traditional native spiritual ideals.  She smudges regularly, participates in sweats.  I know so little of the cultural rituals, although we have discussed them on occasion.    Anyway, what I am getting at is that there is so much about her I love.  I love that way back when.....at the time when my wife declined so quickly, and then when my son was severely injured, that she was one who I could rely on to give me another perspective.  I only knew her online then.  Four years ago, we started to talk.  Only in the last while did we meet.  She is exactly what she portrayed online, except for the physicality.  We really never discussed that.  So yes, I love her.  Is this something that will result in us getting together on a permanent basis, type deal?  Likely not.  I love her in that I really care how she is.  When she hurts, I feel it.  When she is happy, it makes me smile.  But it won\'t likely happen since I can\'t see our different lives meshing.  I know she knows that too.  It\'s a different thing than I have experienced before.  Not really sure......who knows.
It\'s nice to be back home, in familiar surroundings, but it\'s sad too, all at the same time. It means that the break is virtually over - work starts all over again on Monday, but, as Sally rightly pointed out, it\'s not long till Easter, and even out June two week holiday isn\'t that far away. (guess, we\'d better get it booked then)  Did we enjoy our time in Northumberland? Overall yes. Would we go back? Yes. To the same place? Probably. At the same time of the year? No. Right place - wrong time we think.  We went food shopping when we got back home, and saw more people in Sainsburys alone than we had seen the whole time we were away! I mean, the shop was even OPEN. At 3 in the afternoon! Come on, all the shops would have been long shut where we\'ve been by that time on a Saturday afternoon! ;-)  So, where are we thinking of for June? Wales is the favourite again at the moment. The site we stayed at near St Davids in the yurt last year now have the self catering apartment fully up and running, and that is available when we want to go, for either one or two weeks. But, we are thinking about going there for the first week, and then moving on to the Gower Peninsular for the second week, and have found some good looking cottages/flats that are available then for a sensible price - we just need to get a move on and decide which.
It seems as the past few days everything has been crashing down on me. It\'s only 8 days away from my birthday and this is supposed to be happy and a joyful time. The girl I wanna be with doesn\'t know if she wants to be with me. My dad\'s best friend died 5 years ago on my birthday. I obviously don\'t like Christmas or my birthday anymore. School is beginning to get tougher, I\'m sleeping less, and finding a job is still almost impossible. The economy only seems to be getting worse as time goes by, and our wonderful country seems to be deeper in debt. This is cool, right? In my opinion I think our government is the terrorists. They raise taxes to bail out the banks, they also give there self\'s raises over night. I think 9/11 was something the government did themselves. I\'m not very up to date with political problems and what not, but like I said these are my opinions. Life just sucks....\'When life give\'s you lemons, make lemonade!
Yesterday was the typical Saturday.  Up early and on my way to a job.  It seems like more and more I\'m working every Saturday.  Partly because business is good, and partly because some things I have to do are better done when employees of clients are not around to get in my way.  Yesterday\'s adventure was to change the lamps and ballasts of ten recessed compact fluorescent fixtures located over the grand entrance stairs of a giant software company. Simple, right? I had to rent special scaffolding that is designed to be used over stairs.  I had to drive twenty miles down to San o Haze Friday with my personal truck and trailer to pick up the scaffold because it wouldn\'t fit into my company van.  Loaded and ready, I headed for the Dumbarton bridge and Shallow Alto as the sun was rising Saturday morning. For several years, I have had an automated toll paying device that allows me to zip through without having to interact with a human toll collector.  Because of the multi axle trailer I was pulling, I opted to pay cash for the toll so I would have a receipt to turn in for reimbursement of the eight dollars it was going to cost to cross the bridge.
Well where I start. I received my nickname\'Gump\'from my beloved wife Pat 42 years ago. I met her while driving my 1967 GT Mustang around town. The traffic light at the corner next to the post office turned red. This little girl with blond hair and blue eyes sitting on the steps hollered hey guy how about a ride! The rest is history as it was truly love at first sight. Forty one beautiful years later after a marriage made in Heaven ended this past February 21st at 8:05 AM as the love of my life lost her long battle with cancer. She gave unconditional love to me, our children, grandchildren and family. She was in short, the heartbeat of the entire family. This past twelve months without her is still unbearable at times. Everything that once held meaning has lost it. If I am healing or coming to terms with it, it is going very slow with still daily bouts of tears and depression. She was like a moonbeam that you could not hold in your hand, but just enjoy every minute of her presence. So I trudge on alone now living one day at a time, sometimes an hour at a time. The good thing is I still have my family who loves me very much. I have two daughters, Missy and Tina. I also have a son, Richie. I tend to lean on Tina the most. She has been taking care of me every day. She truly reflects her mother\'s love beyond measure. So why did I come to MySpace? Maybe to find new friends who have already made this journey. Someone to share their thoughts with me and in tern maybe I can be some help to them. I love music, poetry, love stories~with happy endings~ and life. Yes I still love life and all its beauty. I\'m not sure what waits on the other side, but I enjoy life on this side. So as my journey continues until I am called Home, I\'ll do the best that I can do. It is the least that I can do for the memory of my beautiful wife Pat....
Ok so this is my very first shot at blogging, not sure why I\'m doing this I just have a need to try some new things so here we go. I think seeing as this is called St. John\'s livin I will focus on goings on in my city mostly because I often feel guilty when I think there is nothing to do here.  A few of my friends have there hands in things that not everyone knows about so I will reference them often. Stephanie writes for a local paper she reviews plays and shows for them, also she writes a fashoin piece for them as well. Ian has his own photgraphy site and it is picking up steam www.ianvardy.com and Ashley is a dance teacher here in the city that has great connections in the local hip-hop scence which is also growing by pops and locks everyday.  Now I know the way my mind works so there is no way I will be able to stick to the idea that this is only going to be about local art and music scene, more often then not this will be my random mind grapes being stomped out into the blogosphere. With that being said I am going to Toronto tomorrow for a family we,\'ing(allways interesting) and I\'m also going to try and catch a hip hop class while there, so when I get back I\'ll chat about that and go from there.
Well, I was gone and now I am back. I have been doing that a lot lately. Life has been busy and I am sure it has been that way with you guys too. Life is still the same out here other than being busier. Its still up in the air about custody of my son Ian but things seem to be going in my favor. The state, Department of Human Services, my lawyer, and Ian\'s Lawyer are all recommending that he is placed permanently with me. Of course Chelseas lawyer is recommending he is returned to her. But that is what he is being paid to do. I am sure if he wasn\'t he wouldn\'t. She is still trying to tell everyone that I take my kids from their mothers just because I have all my kids.  Could she prove her stupidity any better?!? I got Matthew because his mother let her boyfriend beat on him like he is some kind of whipping boy. The state took him away from her and terminated her rights thinking I was dead because that\'s what she told them. Only after I found out where my son was and proved that I was his father did the state give him to me. I got John when his mom was having some problems. Texas Child Protective Services placed him with me and his mom agreed with me is the best place for Little John. He is a da,\'ies boy. From the day he was born he has been in his da,\'ies arms. And I share custody of my son Brandon and my daughter Kailyn with their mom. So how in the hell do I take my kids from their mothers?!?  Sorry, I had to get that out of my system. Its been pissing me off.  Other than that things are still the same. No personal life to speak of (Dont blame them, what woman would want this kind of drama?), constantly working to improve the house, and tooling around the back roads in my car to relieve stress. I haven\'t even had time to sit down and write anything.  But, the kids are getting bigger, Matts raised his grades significantly (Now I have to give back his ps2 and listen to that shit all day.), Kailyn is getting into more stuff than ever, and Brandons mom got him the worst haircut I have ever seen on the boy. He has a big head already and his mom got his hair cut waaaay to high and now he not only looks like he has a big head, but a fat one too. And she wont let me cut the rest of it off so it wont look so bad. But damn, it already looks bad! That\'s it! That woman will not ever choose his haircuts again! Besides, the barber shop is a father/son thing. Beauty parlor my ass. The boy needs to start seeing a real barber. Maybe then they wont make him look like he has a fat head.  It seems like I have missed a lot on here but I see all the old wars are still going. All I can do is sit back with some popcorn and enjoy the show. You could say something to the tards but it wouldn\'t do any good, they will still be a tard tomorrow. At least it takes my mind off of all my crap. I can watch them and think,\' My shit would be a whole lot worse if I was a dumb as them.\' Thankfully there are a few of us that aren\'t that stupid.   Well, that what\'s going on in my part of the world. While I am listening to my son rock out on guitar hero all friggin day why don\'t you all drop me a comment letting me know how ya\'ll are doing?
Flirting is fun. It provides verification for us as being attractive to the opposite sex. It also provides the Macaroni to our steak dinner now and then that gives us the spice in our lives to constantly strive to renew our sexual relationship at home. My wife and I broke through the monotony of our everyday relationship by discovering the joys of \'sexing\'. We had forgotten the joys of flirting between each other when; after all, our whole RELATIONSHIP was based on our first flirting exchange.  If you are married, that is your goal. To take the innocent flirtations of everyday life home, and use them to further your relationship there. We get stale, and sometimes that one smile from a returned flirtation gives us the confidence to go home and show our S.O. just how desirable we can be.      If you guys are single, get to it. There is nothing more attractive than someone who has mastered the art of flirting with confidence. If you need help as always I am here for you to try out your flirting on.
..This morning I feel like someone ran over me with a Semi while I was looking somewhere else.  I didn\'t do anything yesterday to deserve all of this misery and the Sun is shining so my mood should be good.  Even the hair on my head feels like someone is trying to break it in half.  I did not have a good nights sleep but I could not figure out why I kept waking up about every hour and a half.  Even the coffee this morning does not clear my head.  I hope this clears up soon as we are heading down to Chicago tomorrow morning to visit with the mi,\'le daughter and introduce the Brown dog to where she is going to spend the month of April while we head out to Arizona for the mu,\'y season.  I was looking forward to our upcoming trip but I sure don\'t want to start it feeling like this.  Even typing is painful as the hands feel more like hot burning lead and do not get better with usage.  I think I will go dip them in hot coffee.  Later.
I am a vicious drinker, but a gentile drunk. I have more stress than people realize, with the potential to let just about anything roll off my back. Gross things that normal people would barf over don\'t bother me, but I can\'t stand a messy house. I\'m randomly on time, but I always show up. Being stuck in boring conversation makes me want a revolver stuck to my head, but I love carousing threw crowds to find new topics. I have acute paranoia, but am very trusting. I\'m bigger better stronger faster, yet streamlined refined downtown and on the ground. my nose is too big, but fits my face well. My eyes are brown, my hair black, and skin hairy and pale. I\'m irish, german, and native american, that I know of. my temper is very big while my fuse is miles long. i have entirely too much time on my hands, but not enough money to make it count. I like breakfast in the evening, and dinner in the morning. my thought processes often hinder me, due to the fact that I think way too much. I hold those close to me dear in my heart, but purposefully fail to love those undeserving of my affection. I\'m your worst nightmare, your best friend, public enemy, and hero of the day. violence tends to grab me, and loss of freedom sickens me. Some might say I\'m philosopher, while others would claim I\'m a moron. I value intelligence, while spitting on stupidity. You\'ll know everything you need to know about me in 30 mins., then I will proceed to surprise you the rest of your life.   I\'m the best there is at what I do. Oze
For whatever reason, I was up in time to watch the trainwreck that was the\'Tiger Woods Mea Culpa and Press Conference\'. For a time, I wasn\'t sure if I was watching Tiger or a repeat of the opening episode of\'The Good Wife\'. For what it\'s worth, this wasn\'t a\'Press Conference\'so much as it was a\'Public Profession of Sins and a Plea For Forgiveness\'. No questions were allowed. Tiger stood behind a podium, read his speech, acknowledged that he had made\'mistakes\'and asked for the media to leave his wife and child alone. He took all the blame upon himself (which was admirable) and dispelled the rumors that his wife, Elin, had wailed on him with a 9-iron for his indiscretions by stating that they had never had any episodes of Domestic Abuse.  There were a few Tiger supporters there...but Elin was conspicuously absent.
OK- It\'s time for my hip replacement.   As many of you know, after retiring, I joined the circus. Jumbo the Elephant would wrap his trunk around my right leg as I juggled small appliances -- toasters, blenders, coffee grinders. A crowd pleaser, but this probably was the original source of my troubles. When Joey (the human cannon ball) got the H1N1 last spring, circus management asked me to step into the act. The first landings went well, but those su,\'en accelerations from the cannon applied great pressure to my already weakened right leg. Then, I sort of over shot the landing net -- and well, met some very nice people in the audience. The MRI of my hip, which many of you will receive in our Christmas card, captured the true cost of my fond circus dreams.   So, I have cancelled my audition for Riverdance and my subscription to Pole Vaulter Monthly.   And in the prophetic words of Goldie Hawn of Laugh In: Socket To Me.   More later...
Give me advice. Tell me one of your favorite accomplishments or destinations. Tell me something you\'ve always wanted to do and why. Just make a suggestion. It could be to learn your favorite birdcall or to visit a favorite locale. It could be to play chess in a park or to learn to drive a motorcycle. Share something. Teach something. Plus, you get super triple extra bonus points if you go so far as to help with a direction or recommendation for HOW to go about doing whatever it is you suggest. Here are a few random uncompleted items off of my Life List that might spark your thinking. I won\'t get through them all yet, but I\'ll cross a few of these off in the next 90 days.
I had a really good weekend, visiting with friends on Friday and Saturday evening.   Friday night Susan came over and we looked at her virus protection on her laptop. Joining the crew was Dave and Sandy. Dave also brought his brand-new Dell laptop computer running Windows 7. We unpacked the laptop and got everything set up for him. This all over pizza, and in time to watch the Penguins play..... basically geek heaven.  Saturday night my old friend Mark and his family came over and we went to dinner at Damon\'s restaurant. It has probably been 12 or 13 years since I\'ve eaten at a Damon\'s restaurant, it was really good and the service was good too.  Mark brought down three new Penguins game jerseys, a Jordan Staal and Sidney Crosby for me and a Sidney Crosby for my other friend Dave..... All in all a pretty full weekend and it\'s only Sunday morning. The Penguins play tonight at five and I\'m already wearing my new white Jordan Staal jersey in anticipation..... let\'s go Pens

I desperately wanted to do some photography this weekend. But every time I stepped out of the house I became uninspired by this bleak New England winter, the colorless landscape, the harsh mid-day lights, and all the ugly people. I don\'t know why anyone would want to come to America.  So I spent much of my weekend watching Boys over Flowers (Korean drama). Plus I did my taxes, spent a lot of time in my kitchen cooking, ran some errands, and join some friends for dinner at their house Saturday night for hotpot. Overall, an uneventful weekend.  Most of the time, I sat there by my phone wondering when someone would call me up to go hang out. I was too proud to call anyone else up of course. Anything would have done really. It\'s been awhile since I\'ve experienced this kind of isolation. But I guess you need these kind of weekends once in awhile to put life into perspective. One day when everyone is settled down with family there\'ll be no one around to hang out with, no snowboarding trips, no birthday dinners with friends, no clubbing, and no meeting up for lunch.  I know I tell everyone that I rather be single; that family life just seems so boring. I make a lot of excuses of why I rather not be in a relationship or ask this or that girl out. But after much thought about this I realized that I\'m terrified. Not of asking a girl out, but that I\'ll end up in another relationship where I\'ll be miserable and she ends up breaking my heart again. So I\'ve been avoiding relationships like the plague.  But if I don\'t overcome this fear, then I\'ll end up seeing more of my weekends like this one when everyone finally settles down. What will I do then?
Life is an illusion, as the Bu,\'hists say. Life is simply a test, as the Christians suggest. Yet with its horrors and glories combined, it is a wondrous experience with tearing negativity and soothing hands that caress in a way that can only be described as yin-and-yang  I am here.      This feeling in me, is of none I have ever experienced. I once lie in my bed, dreading the morning, wishing to myself that this all be a dream. I had pondered whether or not I was just a thought, an illusion, a dream in the mind of the creator. Pain and anguish flourished in my life: I hoped that reality (my reality) was a dream.      As I lay here, in another\'s bed, cast out of the tides of ravish: into the stream of consciousness -- I feel like the world is passing me by. Helplessness overcomes me as I sit on the bottom of the stream and the currents of my life pass me rapidly. The rivers of time will erode me into sad, dust. Yet as everybody around me comes and goes like seasons -- how they spring to life, stabilize, grow weary, and then fade into the cold -- I am in the midst of a Renaissance.      Like my younger days, I lie in bed thinking life to be a dream, I hold my pillow close saying, \'five more minutes.
I\'ve had some nasty experiences with dentist over the years. In fact I\'m sort of glad you have posted this \'cos I might dig out a letter I sent in a moment of pique to my dentist surgery. I\'ll dig it out and post it.  My own teeth - despite regular servicing and dental care - are falling like that pack of dominoes. I have few at the back to usefully chew. This makes me favor my front teeth for chewing which has the effect of making me accidentally bite and chew my lips. But I hate the idea of falsies; though I have heard that they are better than the wooden ones they offered folk when I was much younger.
I cannot believe the politicians we send to office. Are the politicians so afraid of not being reelected that they will not give an up or down vote?  I believe that everyone should have access to healthcare, and healthcare needs to be reformed at the most basic level. It frustrates me knowing the politicians do not have the courage to represent the people. It seems every topic is split between the party lines.   No politician is working for the good of the people, they are all worried about playing politics. It\'s actually disgusting. Come November I plan on a clean sweep.... my personal belief is, two terms and you\'re out. Enough of career politicians, enough of politics as usual, enough of this nonsense.
Hello, Peeps! Thanks for visiting my blog. It\'s a place that allows me to share all the cool creative people and their creations I come across in this world. And, a place to showcase some of my work. I\'m a designer, and I believe that if you can dream it you can do it. I apply that very basic belief to every aspect of my life and work. After my family, my greatest passion is to design and create things that are new, unique, and on the edge. Creativity and inspiration are all around us everyday. Anyone can recognize when something is beautiful, the secret is to take the time and learn why it is.
As I write at 10am, it is 26 degrees.  The low last night was around 20, the worst of a series of overnight freezes here in Central Texas since December and on the way to becoming the coldest winter on record.    Last summer was the hottest on record.  It leaves me wondering if whatever is going on with the climate isn\'t so much global warming (although overall, it is) as extreme fluctuations, like a swing with a bonfire on one side and an iceberg on the other. If so, how far each way will it go?  Maybe it\'s just a coincidence.
I just finished a video project on Utah after 9/11 for the paper. It was coupled with a small portrait series. I was very impressed with those I interviewed. From the General of the Utah National Guard to a married couple who were blocks from the Twin Towers when they were attacked, to parents of fallen soldiers, they all spoke so open and candidly with me.  I naturally thought how my life has changed since 9/11. When I was a kid I was interested in the decade of the 60s. From what I saw and read, it seemed like so much changed so quickly, and the things that did change were monumental.  I wonder what will be said about the last decade. I remember the morning of the attacks, it was my first semester at community college, and I remember the year following; the patriotism, the national reverence at all the memorials. I feel like it was an interesting time to be a college freshman. It all came to a point when almost exactly a year after the attacks I was moving back to Germany for two years for church service. It was a month or so after the US Congress had authorized the military to go into Iraq. The stewardess handed me a copy of the Frankfurter Allegemeine newspaper and the front page photo was a giant protest against the US going to war. I remember looking at that photo and realizing that I was entering a very different sea of opinions than post 9/11 America.  7-8 years later I am still wrestling with my opinions on the war(s) etc. I feel myself pulled to the moderate center, but then I feel like I use those words to dress up fence sitting. It is funny how since 9/11, the more I hear the resolute opinions of others, the less I want to have my own.
Hey.  Things are going great down here in alabama.  it is really hot though.  i hate to say it but i miss maine\'s weather.   Especially when it comes time to do pt every day.  congrads on the job in new York.  Do you like it there?  I hope everything is going good for you.  Are you going to be able to go home for Christmas?  I\'m planning on going home for a week or two. It was really nice seeing my mom and erin for my graduation.  I just wish I could of spent more than one day with them. Well i have to get going but take care and it was nice hearing from you.
I\'m so tired of myself...  I\'m so tired of being in love...  I\'m so tired of wanting to be in love...  I\'m so tired of always being alone...  I\'m so tired of not having someone to talk to...  I\'m so tired of not having someone to show how much I love them...  I\'m so tired of not having someone show how much they love me...  I\'m so tired that I don\'t have someone to hold onto...  I\'m so tired that I have no one to lie to  and tell them I\'m cold just so I could cu,\'le with them...  I\'m so tired of having no one to kiss over and over again...
I love me my Star Wars.  No, seriously. My first memory is of watching Return of the Jedi. Even though I felt deeply nonplussed by Killer Klones and Revenge of the Mediocre, I am still George Lucas\'s bitch. I\'ve bought the VHS, the DVD. I have Action Figures. Mini-Lego Sets. I ran a go,\'amn Star Wars D20 game.  I would not be surprised that my individual contribution probably paid for Jett\'s braces.  So a few years ago Republic Commando comes out for the PC and Xbox. It gets good reviews, but I hold off, waiting for a price drop. It hits the bargain rack, but I have a huge backlog  and I\'ll be back in Walmart next week.  There\'s always another time.  Well, oops. Republic Commando left the bargain rack, and I figured that the game had passed me by. Then along comes Steam and its fiendish Holiday Sale (the number one reason why posters in the GESC will never finish that novel, that iPhone app, or rake that layer of leaves resting on the lawn). 5 bucks! Hot damn! Five bucks!  Click. Sold.  Having just gotten done with Batman: Arkham Asylum, I wanted something quick and zippy. Republic Commando fit the bill. Let\'s see how well it stands the test of time.  At first, I was seriously meh. I had just finished Arkham Asylum, a gaming equivalent of The Dark Knight. You know why it\'s been roundly praised as 2009\'s Game of the Year? You\'re the GO,\'AMN BATMAN! No, seriously. It\'s the closest thing you\'ll get to being an unhinged badass vigilante mofo with impeccable controls and incredible design.  And then along comes Republic Commando, a very decent licensed squad-based shooter. It felt like weak sauce. Decent is good. Would that more games were decent. After 2009\'s GOTY, decent just felt  decent.  The first third of Republic Commando feels like a well-done generic squad shooter. Simple commands? Check. Weapons? Standard fare. License? Effective. Levels? Acceptable. Controls? Floaty. I spent most of the time feeling like I was piloting an underpowered floating turret. My assault rifle  just didn\'t do much assaulting. Hell, I used my pistol as my go-to weapon   at least I wasn\'t wasting ammo. On top of that, the level design just felt bland. I turned to my girlfriend and told her that it was just a bit of a bore.  Did I just waste five bucks?  The next night, I tackled the Assault Ship campaign, and su,\'enly things started getting better. Sure there was some copy/paste level design with ship corridors, but overall, I felt far more immersed in the game. Blasting flying bugs in a brown landscape? Been there, done that. Crawling through the guts of a \'star destroyer\' (Republic Assault Ship. I know. There\'s a difference.), checking corners, breaching doors, and rescuing downed comrades? Hell yeah! That\'s what Genndy Tartakovsky is all about.  Last night, I decided to put this baby to bed. The Kashyyyk campaign finally felt like a full-on Star Wars experience. You finally had decent weapons, your squad seemed to have stepped up its game, and the environments and levels stopped feeling generic. More than that, they got the final battles \'right.\' In fact, there wasn\'t a final battle, per se. You traversed a collection of skirmishes with your team doing door breaches so that you could take down a Separatist Cruiser with cannon fire. Like Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time, there is no final boss, just a final level that tests your skills. When that cruiser came down, it was the exclamation point at the end of a satisfying endurance test.  I was immensely impressed. Most games peter out by the end. Republic Commando just kept getting better. That said, the game did have a number of flaws.  First: the base weapons suck. I rarely felt like I had a weapon in my hand. It wasn\'t until the second campaign where you get the shotgun and the repeater that you actually feel you can open up a can of whoopass. Once the shotty became available, I only used the assault rifle against droids or when I ran out of ammo.   What are we supposed to use? Harsh language?  Also, the graphics are dated. Duh. But still, there were some character models that were embarrassingly low-poly. Wookiees? They looked like they were rendered in the Dark Engine. The environments? Cohesive but unimpressive textures. Your squad looked great (thankfully), but you can definitely tell that the game has not aged as gracefully as it could have. It did, however, run nicely on a bootcamped Macbook White on Max Settings.  Also, you can definitely tell that the levels were designed for the Xbox. Yup. Loading screen. Loading Screen. Walk to the next building. Loading Screen. Oh! Hi! Alex Denton! I\'m a big fan! Loading screen   On the whole, though, Republic Commando is worth five bucks. Indeed, it\'s worth ten. Is it worth the 50 bucks it was at launch? No. But if you\'re a Star Wars fan who wants to drop a ten-spot and hit the wayback machine, take a look.
Two people stood in the busy street, the hustling thunder of the traffic an ostinato to their symphony of conversation.\'you look well\'he said with the awkwardness of memories lying on his tongue, as thick and sweet and decadently shaming as honey, and everything seemed to click back into place, just like two summers and 900 kisses ago.\'thank you\'she said, and the love they felt for each other trailed behind them like scarves in the wind, twisting up into the sky above them and trailing around the tenements and apartment buildings, buzzing with life and electricity, intertwined and indivisible.  All around them the traffic danced and the peopled buzzed forward and they just talked. And it was like all there was about them was a field, and a beacon and the grey sky above, telling them to long for the ground, and each other and their lips and kisses and- His phone rings, she jumps and the spell is broken, the strings of violins snap, the conductor gasps. The symphony is silent and as they realise what they have been dreaming, and how dangerously close they came to connecting, he answers the phone and the signals of reality and boredom seep back in. A hand goes up, an absent-minded\'bye\'and he hurries away. She stands in the street alone and begins to wrap up the tangles of her scarf, winding back the kite. A tear falls, or is it a raindrop. In the flood of a city, who can notice the difference?
It was 63° today and the snow has finally melted off most of the sidewalks. So I made it over to Starbucks and had tea this afternoon. It was so nice getting out of the house and enjoying the warmer weather. Maybe winter is finally over, after all it\'s almost St. Patrick\'s Day! I could sure go for a Guinness or two about now.  The mayor of Pittsburgh has declared a state of emergency in advance of flooding. Hopefully people are prepared, Especially those in flood prone areas. The weather forecast is expecting rain the next few days on top of melting snows in the higher elevations.....  The last few weeks I have been using my Netflix account to watch a ton of movies... plus the on-demand cable. Now that the weather is getting nicer I plan on being outside more as soon as the 1 foot of snow and ice melt off of my back deck....
I attended the sold-out Muse concert at the GMU-Patriot Center a few weeks back, and they give a fantastic live show. Now, this is a blog about film, so discussing a live concert may seem a little strange. But Muse uses a very impressive sound and light show, including showing sci-fi style video clips. I could include a link to a clip of a live performance here, but instead I\'ve got something better. As long as we\'re on the topic of short film, here is Muse\'s music video for their song\'Knights of Cydonia\'. It\'s a silent kung-fu/space-western set to the song. Check it out: Posted by Andrew Cohen at 11:35 PM 0 comments Links to this post Labels: Knights of Cydonia, Muse, Music Videos, Short Films Sunday, March 14, 2010 Some Chill Short Films You know, this being the blog for a film club and all, I figured it would be a good idea to post this.

Posted by Adam Chubak at 5:57 PM 1 comments Links to this post Labels: Short Films Saturday, March 13, 2010 Lady Gaga: Auteur I spent the day watching Lady Gaga videos on Youtube (It\'s spring break, okay?). After watching\'Paparazzi\'for the fifth time or so I began to dig into past SFFS events/meetings, and I realized that Lady Gaga has come up many many times in our various activities.  Why is this?  I\'m not sure whether or not to chalk it up to pure coincidence, or whether to dig deeper into the Lady\'s prevalence in SFFS activities. Let me give a brief outline of what I\'m talking about.  At one of our meetings, when trying to fix a technical problem on the projector, I put on the video\'Bad Romance.\'I knew that the video started off with sound, and since our problem was an audio one, I figured it\'d be a useful video to use. After we fixed the problem, we watched David Lynch\'s\'The Alphabet,\'a short film that I described afterward as a sort of\'moving canvas.\'What was even more telling than this was when member Justin Cousson, about thirty-seconds into the short, said something along the lines of,\'Is this another Lady Gaga video?\'I laughed at the time, but, now that I\'m thinking about it, the aesthetic of the\'Bad Romance\'video is very Lynchian, which is to say, it\'s very Kubrickian. For a visual explanation of what I mean, see the following screencap:
Last year I made my New Year\'s resolutions public on my blog. That seemed to help me complete a good handful of them (final score here). So I am going to have another go at it   Big Stuff  Finish my pilots licence. It is just getting embarrassing at this point.  Keep up the vacation plan and take at least 2 vacation that are more than 3 days. Hey people die at my age, got to get with it.  At least 6 date nights with my wife. This would be more than the sum of all dates in the last 10 years (guess how old the oldest is) so this is a very aggressive goal.  Go sailing at least 3 times (have not been since I was a kid).  Get my wife to go sailing at least once (if I pull this one off I need a medal).  Read at least one book that is not fiction, self help or business related. Not exactly what is left to read but there must be something out there.  Maintain my weight (unless of course I am exposed to some freak nuclear activity that turns me into a ripped super hero overnight, in which case I will let this one go).  Have neighbors and friends over for dinner. Small groups 1-2 couples. It is easier to dig up the dirt that way.  Go at least once to the Walt Disney Concert Hall. Hopefully the rest of the family will come too.  The Little List  Now that I have found my foil and my kids are starting to express an interest I will bring this back to the list. Based on last years performance I am probably just being silly.  2010 is the 20 year high school mark for both my wife and myself. Hoping we actually go so we laugh our asses off.  Become proficient at tying my turban. There really is no reason as I could never wear it outside of the house, but man it feels great. No joke, can\'t explain it but it just feels great. Help mental focus, I swear.  Own and wear more hats. I love hats, why are they so out of fashion.  Golf at least once.  Make an effort to get technically better at taking photos now that I have a camera that can support it. Technically better means not having to take 200 photos to get lucky on 10.  Take kids again on a train ride up to LA and explore. Hmmm boa and boba, sounds good right now.  Drink more scotch (hey, I put it on the little list)  Looking at this list it feels a little like a bucket list.
It was a beautiful sunset landing in Las Vegas last night, and today was a crazy good first day at the show! The fashion peeps are some of the coolest on the planet. Boundless creativity and vision. I was loving every minute of it...despite my sore feet! I would love to know how many miles I walked. It was a whole lot, but worth every step!  Out of respect for the designers, I didn\'t take any close ups of the new products, but I did manage to snap a few shots to give you a little of the atmosphere. This company makes their socks with bamboo...yes you read that right...bamboo! And, you would not believe how soft and wonderful they are! So cool...so GREEN...so awesome!  There was SO MUCH more, but I was so focused on the next rad piece around each corner, I just couldn\'t stop to take more photos. But, I will leave you with a very cool video I took at the end of the day in STREET Have a great day eveyone! I\'m off to start day 2! :-)
Nasty under the skin, we meet and see our self\'s in the mirror our images superimposed, ready or not I peer into your soul and dive deep splash landing in a pool of pain As salty and familiar as the tears that run down my cheek your eyes don\'t like what I see You don\'t want to be me, pain is what I see, Am sorry that I couldn\'t be there. So you curse at me and smash the mirror, scream and beg for it to stop so now What do you get, in the hands of despair just splinters of glass, and tears of regret, Now look again and tell me what you see, a monster Is what I plea.
All right. So, here we go. The first parody of many to come. Please let me know what you think. Also, I will post a link to a youtube video of the original song so you may get the full experience of mine...ya know, if you play it while reading mine.  This was the very first parody that I made and wrote down to remember. For a long time in my life, I had been making up parodies to myself - just silly little changes to the songs - and they amused me. But if I ever tried to tell someone about it, I couldn\'t remember what I said. So, I promised myself that I would start writing down my parodies, and this was the next one to come. Bailey is a cat. But not just any cat. He is a seventeen pound cat belonging to my fiancé. For those of you not familiar with pet weights, seventeen is freaking huge for a cat. You can\'t really blame my fiancé\'s family though. They found the cat as a stray and apparently wanted it to eat it\'s fill. Anyway, I had the song Lady by Styx stuck in my head all day as I cut my fiancé\'s grass. I took a shower after I was done and when I walked out of the shower, there was Bailey sleeping soundly. I started singing Lady, but replaced Lady with Bailey. Upon hearing his name, he opened one eye and glared at me for waking him up. I then made up the second verse then and there. The rest of the song I made up later. Enjoy!
Observation. I love to watch. Unlike the scene in\'Being There\', this has nothing to do with Peter Sellers and Shirley Maclaine. More importantly, it involves not just watching, but understanding the world around us. I have a point of view and I express it here.
Mind keep chewing old thoughts, random memories..turning the essence like juice savored slowly swirled around the tongue some fragments stay stuck in crevices between teeth lips smile at the taste of the memory living in a tiny body perched on a tiny planet rotating/revolving in a set path in a universe that is moving in a hurry somewhere at breakneck speed .the mind gets disoriented too many things flash by through the window to the eternal space .even though there is stillness around ..we live stacked upon each other and feelings and thoughts struggle in the crowd to breathe, su,\'enly there comes a break as when the train rushes su,\'enly through a country side we breathe fresh air .like caressing strands of old music drifting aimlessly with the breeze, like an unanticipated unadulterated kiss in the mi,\'le of a mundane-any-other-day, like the fleeting smile on the lips of a sleeping puppy ...the stink becomes just a memory for a few seconds .and eyes begin to sparkle looking ahead making soft dreams out of all that is left and all that is gathered new.
Academic: I seek to foster a research environment and culture at an undergraduate level, knowing that good undergraduate students make good graduate candidates. I wish to instill in the younger generation the desire to produce quality results that are cutting edge in their field of work.Personal: I am interested in fostering a healthy non-academic environment in which students can participate. A healthy dormitory life can be just as important as the availability of a quality education to the overall outcome of a student. I enjoy the non-academic activities available for student interaction and growth.I enjoy reading and constantly exploring new ideas and technologies from all different fields. More often than not I have been inspired by knowledge of advances in ancillary fields when attempting to solve problems in my own.Taught my first course in the Fall Qtr. 2006, undergraduate Transport Phenomena. The following spring I taught my first graduate course, Graduate Transport Phenomena, then in Fall 2007 I taught Biomechanics, Winter 2007 I helped to teach Senior Design Laboratory for engineers. This last year I assisted for most of those classes again. I have found what I love to do.Have been involved in research since 2001, and look forward to a lifelong involvement in academia. I doubt I will head back to an industry-life, but life has taught me that I can never predict exactly where it will take me
The dinner plates began to go cold. Some would say eat while you can. Others would say as long as you can is all that matters. The masters of the world know that the key to life is in their hands. So, they pull the strings and manipulate. Because, they know you\'ll jump through hoops to get what they have.  The game of life used to be survival. And now, the game of life is slavery. Ha. They say life is unfair. Well, why do you think that is?  Give me more Britney Spears. Give me more MTV and TMZ. Tune me into your programs. My brain is still unclean. It needs more washing. Whatta\' ya\' say, Uncle Sam?  Whatta\' ya\' say Obama? Ha. I\'m being puppeteered by the puppet.  You win America. We are your slaves. Now hand me that big check that isn\'t quite big enough and dangle the food above me.  Just don\'t get comfortable. Karma will come to collect. Lololololololololzzzzzzzzzzzzzz. Fruits.
There are some people in this world who are given the possibility to realize their dreams. Only problem is, that these opportunities are place on their lap, but they either don\'t have the knowhow, persistence or maybe just get bored with the situation at hand and then, they simply don\'t see it through. I knew such a man...  This man I once knew was pretty resourceful. Ever since he was young he had this dream to travel the world. So, he looked for a career that would offer him that ticket. He liked music, opera in particular. He sang alright, but he soon realizes it would never gain him international acclaim. Knowing that singing was not going to fulfill that dream of his, he found a way to gather what money he could and traveled to a distant land.  Truth of the matter was, that this man was driven. He had his goals in mind and he was determined one way or another to get where he wanted. What he had going for him was that he was hard working, but that card playing risk taker of life always shadowed him. Yes, he gambled alright. But, it was strictly on life. Other people saw these qualities in him and he rose quickly in the ranks of the corporate world. And as destiny would have it, it allowed him the opportunity to fulfill his dream of traveling. In his travels he met all types of characters of the world of finance and trade. All of which suited him fine. Since these characters were now fulfilling his sense of adventure.
I wanted to write a thing about this picture here since November last year. This picture here was published in TOI on 29th Nov 2009. Yes, 3 days after the 26/11 attacks on Mumbai... India rather. England Cricket team was on a tour of India. You can see in the picture, England captain being guarded by a commando while the captain is on the street heading towards his Hotel I presume. Well the thing that strikes me is, What if a terrorist had tried shooting the Captain? The man in the \'line of fire\' is not the captain but the Guard yo see in-front of him. The questions that hit me is, What creates this Difference in class? What makes the life of the Captain more precious than that of the guard? The captain may be good with hitting the ball on a \'Life-friendly\' playground. But the guard is also great with protecting lives, protecting nation with his accurate aim on the enemies. Leave the so called \'hero of a nation\' on a battle field, he is helpless as a fly caught in a web. So the brain(in this case, the talent) is not a thing that differentiates. Is it that the captain wears an Adidas jacket and the guard a cheap military cloth? That the captain gets a thousand dollar haircut in fashion and the guard a home made one? Both have their own occupations. Each specialized in their own skills. According to me, the commando here is a much more socially responsible person than the captain. So, what makes the captain\'s life more worthy than that of the commando? Imagine if both die in a terrorist attack. The death of the captain will be a great loss(world shock) for years. But no one will bother to remember the name of the commando except for their \'Below Poverty Line\' family!!!
Sweden is in recession. Most companies and organisations are cutting down on their R&D and trimming external consultants. The whole media sector is experiencing disruptive changes, many of them are seeing their revenues dwindling.   I find it a bit strange that everybody in the established media sector seem to agree on:  There will be big turmoil in their markets due to internet and media digitalisation. Nobody really knows what will happen or what will work in the near future. And still they cut down on R&D! It is as if they just hope that somebody else will come up with a working internet business model and they will be able to jump on that wagon when it starts moving and then everything will be fine again.  But hey, there will not be one or two internet business models replacing today\'s media models. There will be hundreds!  And we are now seeing just the beginning of the media industry disruption, it will get much worse soon.  But disruptive times have always created opportunities for those that see them, often people from outside the existing industries, people that are not hindered by \'we have never done it like that before\', or \'that won\'t work\'.  The way to create real innovation and progress in disruptive times is to gather a wild mix of creative people of all types and enable them to brainstorm and network. A,\' the low cost of developing and live test web apps these days and great stuff can evolve quickly!
The curse of a hurt man.... Hi, all  I do not appreciate personal blogs which are just related to the person writing but this time I cant help  I have to tell this  Please read it as far as you could . Its midnight, I m somewhere between Thursday and Friday and undoubtedly one of the happiest guy. The reason is very very simple but quiet have a history of its own, SPS BULLS lost. Yes you heard me right, SPS BULLS lost and I m lot lot more happier than the guys who shot them down. Its an Oh I Say!!!! Moment for me, watching the game from far away, so far I do not have any idea of score and knew only when they lost but ah they lost  Nothing can get more gratifying then this .  Why do I need to be so happy, it had to happen. They were destined for the defeat and I knew it very early  earlier than this fixture was declared.. earlier than this tournament began, even earlier than last one Once upon a time, when i was hurt, i was really hurt by many guys, i never showed any emotion, not even to myself in alone  But today i did  I laughed.. I screamed and if there exists a parallel universe, I want to console that boy who is alone, hurt, whose ego is bruised and who cannot do anything for it but to keep quiet  Time stood by me  You all see, time stood by my side and I m laughing with him over you assholes who always demanded without even thinking how much effort I ever put. Assholes who always wanted me to keep there words but never kept my smallest of feeling. Who were stars but never care how much my hands are burnt in this stardom. Don\'t get me wrong, I never asked for credit but at least listen before discarding anyone hardwork just because it doesn\'t fit to your moronism  I don\'t need credit, I had enough  But I can never forget the questions asked to me, especially by the boy whom I always took care about  He hurt me not the year ago but way before than that  when we were in 2nd year and he wounded me so much that I did what I never even thought of  it was shameful but I have no control over the fury I had within . and we both knew it...  I don\'t think anyone else than me would be interested in all the things I wrote but if you are still reading it means you could sense what I m talking about   Exactly an year ago I had to face allegations, serious ones from the guys who do not know what a team mean, who have no idea how its made, and what it takes to keep a team alive. One of the mediator, Sandeep asked me, do i have any answer to these allegements, i then said i have 100 replies of their each question but i need not to answer a single of them, because i was million percent confident of their fate. i would have confirmed their doom that week itself but Sandeep f betrayed me and shamelessly unwrapped my mission of making a new team and its painfull.. more than you could ever imagine  They would have ate the dust there only but sandeep exposed it before time and I was ravaged  You might be thinking we are here to study and why the hell should I take Cricket so seriously, but no, it was serious, more than even i could imagine and it was about how we live and how we think  but I m happy that serious cricket is over and my time with assholes too  Now i m happily semi retire and play for warriors, a lovely team who listen me and even i never ever shown my face in practice and friendly matches but they want me in their team as far as i think. Cricket as a game is over for me and i play just to be with the guys who took me when other teams like Broomsticks refused to take me in their team. Anyways where the hell is Broomsticks ????   At last about SPS BULLS  i have many things to say but i don\'t think anyone would be interested, you already had enough reading it till here and i cannot ask for more.. There dream of Major Tournament is over in 1st round and i advice to them is that none of you ever had strength of this major tournament  Try your luck in Super 6 in Fuera, I m not going to play that but my good wishes for that..  Those guys didn\'t won a single game after, not a single game in the major tournament and stars of yesterdays are out in 2 consecutive tournaments in the 1st round .  1 year  2 Tournament  0 Wins  Well Done Boys!!!! After all you did this without me ..
Sous-Vide and Low-Temp Primer Part I February 12th, 2010 · sous vide  posted by Dave Arnold   We have had a lot of requests to make last week\'s low-temp charts available for download. Here you go:    Click here to download the sous vide charts. We are often accused of being long-winded. Guilty. When we looked at the sous-vide primer, however, even we thought it was too long—so we decided to break it into parts. We hope to put out a new section every week (or so). This is how we plan on breaking it down:  I . Introduction to Low-Temperature Cooking and Sous-Vide (Today\'s Installment) II. Use and Abuse of the Vacuum Machine and Packing for Low-Temp Without the Vac III. Vacuum Tricks IV. Temperature Control and Safety V. Cooking Meats and Poultry VI. Cooking Fish VII. Cooking Everything Else Today we have the introduction. It provides an overview for everything else. There won\'t be any specific applications or how-to\'s in this section. That is for later.

Low Temperature Cooking Disadvantages Surface Browning, the Maillard Reaction, and the Challenges of Low-Temperature Cooking Uniformity of Texture IV. Why do Chefs Use Sous Vide? Sous-Vide for Economy Storage Organization Sous-Vide for Effect Texture Modification Flash Pickling and Vacuum Marination Forming De-airing I. GETTING THE TERMS RIGHT:  Sous-vide and low-temperature cooking are just two of the many techniques and processes that are revolutionizing modern cooking. Despite their growing popularity, many remain confused about the difference between low-temperature cooking and sous-vide—including equipment manufacturers. Between the two, low-temperature cooking is undoubtedly the more important.  Low-Temperature Cooking Defined: Cooking low temperature does not mean cooking food to a lower internal temperature than is traditional. Low-temperature cooking refers to the temperature of the cooking medium, not the final temperature of the food being cooked. A rare steak has the same internal temperature whether cooked low-temperature or traditionally. Low temperature cooking is defined as any cooking procedure where the cooking temperature is at or close to the desired final internal temperature. There are two basic requirements for low-temperature cooking:  precise and accurate temperature control; a cooking medium which conducts heat more efficiently and accurately than dry air. Water and water vapor are typical, but oil, stock, or any other liquid will work. By way of example: to cook a steak to an internal temperature of 55°C (131°F), you could either sear it and put it in a 205°C (400°F) finishing oven till it reaches 55°C (131°F) (not low temperature cooking), or quickly sear it and throw it into an oil bath maintained at 55°C (131°F) (low temperature cooking but not sous-vide).  In traditional high-temperature cooking, the temperature of the cooking medium is almost never the same as the desired temperature of the food. That is, while your oven may be heated to 205°C (400°F), your fry oil can to 190°C (375°F), and poaching water to 100°C (212°F), a steak cooked in those mediums can only be considered rare when it reaches an internal temperature of 54°C (129°F). The difference between the desired final food temperature and the temperature of the cooking medium is referred to as temperature delta, or ?T (pronounced \'delta t,\' the triangle is the Greek letter delta). You should just get used to referring to ?T\'s  like, \'hey, you want that squab cooked to 56°C? Do you want to use a ?T?\'  Sous-Vide Defined:  In contrast, the simplest way to define sous-vide may be to refer to its French meaning, \'under vacuum.\' Anything associated with a vacuum machine is sous-vide. In restaurants, the sous-vide process usually (but not always) consists of:  placing products into impervious plastic bags putting those bags under vacuum heat sealing those bags releasing the vacuum further manipulating, processing, or storing This is where it gets confusing: sous-vide techniques are often used for low temperature cooking, but not all sous-vide cooking is low-temperature cooking. The classic example of this is boil-in-bag meals. The cooking medium is boiling water—not low temperature. Yet, because there is a vacuum process involved, it is sous-vide. That said, sous-vide is very effective for low-temp cooking because food inside the bags neither dries out nor loses flavor during prolonged cooking if proper temperature is maintained. The vacuum bags also eliminate evaporation and evaporative cooling. The temperature of the food\'s surface becomes identical to the cooking temperature after a short time.  Chefs and diners alike often confuse sous-vide and low-temperature cooking. Sous-vide must involve a vacuum process; but the food may be cooked at high or low temperatures. About 90% of what cooks want to achieve with low temperature cooking can be achieved without a vacuum.  II. SOME USES AND ADVANTAGES OF LOW TEMPERATURE COOKING:  Uniform Cooking, Increased Consistency, and Shifting Control to the Chef:   Traditional steak vs. low-temp steak. Traditional cooking typically uses a high ?T. Foods cooked in this manner display an overcooked portion on the exterior. Meat cooked at high temperatures does not have one level of doneness—it is tasted as an average, from the well-done exterior to the less cooked center. Low-temperature cooking is less forgiving, because there is no way to average out errors. In a steak cooked at a low ?T, the steak retains the same temperature throughout. The difference of 2°C can make a large difference in texture when there is no averaging effect—you need good temperature control (The entire range of steak doneness, from rare to well-done, is only a matter of 14°C (25°F). Luckily, modern equipment easily gives us temperature control accurate down to a tenth of a degree, which means we can cook products extremely uniformly and get them right 100% of the time.  Uniformity can be a disadvantage—no one wants a giant piece of roast beef that is one color all the way across—but most of the time uniformity is an advantage because it leads to increases consistency. Your steaks will never be over or under  always just right. This advantage cannot be overstated, and it applies to restaurants or home cooks. A,\'itionally, because the hard work of reaching the correct internal temperature is being regulated by an accurate piece of equipment, the responsibility for getting the product right is shifted away from the line cook towards the chef who is choosing the temperature and setting the machine.  Shifting Work from Service to Prep (or from Party to Prep at Home):  We can always make more prep time. Service is what service is. Any time we can shift work away from service towards prep we win. Many low temp techniques require more prep time than their traditional counterparts; but are blindingly fast to finish off at service time. The high speed finish derives from the fact that the food is pre-cooked and can be held warm and ready to go, only needing a few seconds of finishing time. Speed finishing is a boon to the home cook as well. Parties are a lot more fun when you can hang out with your guests and all your food is in perfect finish at the same time.  Low-Temp for Insurance: Low-temp cooking can provide a type of cooking insurance by guaranteeing a minimum doneness. Here\'s how:  1. Low temp your food to the rarest you want it. The food is now uniformly rare. 2. Cool the product completely. 3. Cook the product traditionally, but focus only on obtaining the perfect exterior because the mi,\'le is already cooked. You have insured that the inside is done. Here are some examples of low-temp for insurance:  Roasts can be challenging. Often you get a good crust before the mi,\'le is done and then overcook the whole piece to bring up the center. Other times, you focus on getting the mi,\'le perfect but end up with a poor crust. Low-temp insurance fixes that. Low temp the roast till it is rare and cool it down. Put the roast in a high oven and pull it when the crust is perfect—you have already insured that the mi,\'le is done. On a beef Wellington it is very difficult to insure that the puff pastry and the beef come out nicely at the same time. Usually the meat is overcooked or the pastry is too blond. With low-temp insurance you sear and pre-cook and cool your tenderloin and then wrap it in puff pastry. Now, you can turn your oven up and just focus on getting the pastry nice and brown since your meat is already cooked. Sausages are often poached before being finished in a pan on the grill. This is high-temp cooking insurance. Instead, low temp-cook the sausages (60-62°C is usually good), then finish them on a grill or in the pan. The low-temp pre-cook doesn\'t overcook the meat and rely on fat alone to provide juiciness. Duck breast is best cooked with low-temp insurance. Pre-cook the breast to 57°C and cool it down. Then just focus on crispy skin. Low-temp for insurance tends to produce items that have textures and appearances very close to traditionally cooked items, just better and more consistent. Because the products have a traditional feel, many cooks like this technique.  Low-Temp for New and Novel Textures: Low-temperature cooking also allows for the production of some textures that were traditionally unattainable. Three examples:  Super-low temp fish: Fish heated at extremely low temperatures, around 50°C or (122°F) to an internal temperature of 42°C (107°F), has a dense, fudge-like or custard quality unattainable with high ?T cooking. This type of cooking is controversial; many chefs dislike the texture attained with these methods, and some scientists believe the techniques are unsafe. Other chefs believe that the traditional cooking method overcooks fish and that the low-temperature method is best. Low temperature braises: In a typical braise, meat with a lot of connective tissue is cooked at a high temperature for several hours. The high temperature and several hours is what is needed to break down the collagen into gelatin. This process overcooks the muscle and dries it out. Luckily, the gelatin re-moistens the overcooked meat and produces a delicious braise. When a meat is under-braised, it seems tough and dry because the collagen hasn\'t melted into juicy, water holding gelatin. With low temperature cooking, however, we can hold a tough piece of meat at a very precise temperature for a very long time. If a short rib is held at 6o°C (140°F) it will maintain a lightly pink, medium-cooked color for days. The texture of the muscle fiber itself will also remain somewhat static. The connective tissue, on the other hand, won\'t break down over the course of 3 or 4 hours at this temperature—you need to cook it for two full days. At the end of these two days, however, you will have a completely pink, completely tender short rib that is a dream to slice and portion. Creamy egg yolks: When you heat a whole in-shell egg in water to 63°C (145°F), the yolk becomes creamy—not runny, not set. One degree lower is a runny yolk. One degree higher is a set yolk. The 63°C egg is a delight and completely impossible to make traditionally. More on eggs later. Low-Temp for Increased Tenderness:  Low-temperature cooking can also produce meats that are more tender than normal. Enzymes responsible for some of the benefits of dry-aging meat increase activity as the temperature rises. These enzymes are most active right before they denature, between 49°C and 54.4°C (120°F and 129.9°F). Because low-temperature cooking allows meat to stay in this zone longer than traditional cooking, meat is more tender than normal. Traditionally, a large piece of meat heated for a long period of time, such as a roast, remains tender. Low-temperature cooking makes it possible for smaller pieces of meat to be held at these low temperatures for longer periods of time.  III. LOW TEMPERATURE COOKING DISADVANTAGES  Surface Browning, the Maillard Reaction, and the Challenges of Low-Temperature Cooking:  Low-temperature cooking does not produce crisp, flavorful, brown exteriors, which are usually obtained by cooking at high temperatures. Much of the artistry of low-temp cooking involves getting around this limitation. Some techniques include:  Using meaty, savory flavors like soy sauce and miso (both are high in umami). Quick-searing meats for flavor either before they are cooked, right before they are served, or both. Quick-searing in low-temperature cooking is performed at a higher than normal temperature to develop a brown crust without overcooking the interior of the meat. Browning bones, fat, inexpensive pieces of meat, or vegetables and putting them into the vacuum bag along with the main food before cooking. The savory notes of the a,\'ed pieces permeate the food over time. Roasted fat is especially useful, as many of the characteristic flavors of different meats are generated by the taste of cooked and broken down fats. Uniformity of Texture:  The biggest gripe people have with low-temp cooking is that the uniformity of texture. Some people say that all low temp food is \'mushy.\' While it is true that bad-low temp food is mushy, good low-temp food doesn\'t have to be. One of the ways to guard against uniformity is to provide texture in the finishing step—usually by searing. A,\'ing crunchy garnishes or cooking portions of the food separately to compensate for the lack of textural variety is another option. A chicken breast cooked sous-vide, for example, might be served with a piece of crispy fried chicken skin (although we have had good chicken this way, we find the skin served this way not as satisfying as good-old crispy skin that is still stuck to the chicken). Lastly, European chefs often cook with a moderate ?T (usually 10-15 C) to \'overcook\' the outside of the food and provide some textural variation. Most Americans don\'t cook this way because it require precise temperature measurement, precise timing, or both. Most Americans cook with 0 ?T and a,\' texture in the finishing step.  IV. WHY DO CHEFS USE SOUS-VIDE? SOUS-VIDE FOR ECONOMY AND SOUS-VIDE FOR EFFECT  Chefs may use sous-vide techniques and processes for a variety of reasons which roughly break down into two categories: sous-vide for economy and sous-vide for effect. The two approaches are not mutually exclusive, therefore it\'s important to thoroughly understand both.  Sous-Vide For Economy:  Storage:  Traditionally, vacuum-packing has been used to enhance the storage life of cooked products. The bacteria that cause food spoilage need oxygen to survive. Since vacuum packaging removes all air (and therefore oxygen) from food, spoilage is slowed drastically if the proper steps are taken. Oxidation is also greatly reduced by utilizing vacuum-packing. Foods like cut apples and artichokes do not turn brown quickly in vacuum pouches. In long-term storage, vacuum bags can prevent the oxygen-produced rancidity of unsaturated fats. Low-moisture products like dehydrated fruit chips tend to stay crispy indefinitely in the low-moisture vacuum environment.  Unfortunately, some bacteria that cause illness (pathogens) are not inhibited by a lack of oxygen. In fact, some of the most dangerous bacteria thrive only in the absence of oxygen. If sous-vide products are kept in unsafe conditions, these pathogens can grow to dangerous levels without the simultaneous spoilage that would normally signal their presence. This is why it is important to adhere to safety rules when using sous-vide.  Organization:  Vacuum-packed pre-portioned foods are neat, sanitary, and easy to organize. Many portions of the same product can be fabricated at the same time and then sealed, which minimizes cross-contamination. The food is handled minimally before being placed in a sterile environment. Retrieving food is easy, and each portion is individually protected from spills and other dangers, such as a raw product dripping onto a cooked product.  Sous-Vide for Effect:  Recently, the unique properties of the sous-vide process have inspired a cooking movement that aims solely to increase the quality of food and achieve special culinary effects. Think of this as sous-vide for effect.  Texture Modification (aka Compression):  The key to this technique is long vacuuming to get all the air out of the inside of the food. After the food is sealed and the vacuum released, there is an immediate observable change in the product as the voids that used to contain air are compressed. On some products, the effects of compression are accentuated over time (pears become more translucent after several hours). This process can be accelerated by re-vacuuming the sealed bag until the bag inflates with water vapor and then releasing the vacuum.  Porous foods can have their texture and appearance radically modified by vacuum-packaging. Watermelon, for instance, becomes denser, changing from a mealy to a candy-like texture. Pears, cucumbers, and tomatoes become translucent.      Flash Pickling and Vacuum Marination:  Vacuum-packaging foods increases the uptake of flavorful liquids, brines, and colors. The more porous the item, the more dramatic the end results are. For example, a pear can be colored with port in an hour under vacuum. Cucumbers and other vegetables can be flash pickled in seconds. Meats can be brined in much less time than at atmospheric pressure.  Forming :  The pressure exerted by the atmosphere can be used to form dishes. Layers of food can be pressed extremely flat. Once removed from the bag, these compressed layers become easy to slice into beautiful portions. Food can be arranged as in a terrine, vacuumed, solidified, and sliced for decorative effects. Some effects formerly achieved with a simple mold and a weight can be achieved more easily with a vacuum machine.  De-airing :  When thick sauces and purées are blended, they often have large amounts of air whipped into them. Sometimes this air is undesirable. When chefs use modern thickeners and gelling agents, like xanthan gum, trapped air becomes a problem, as it affects the body of the sauce and its appearance (liquids with many air bubbles appear white and opaque). The thicker the sauce, the more difficult it is to remove air. Sauces that contain too much air can be made crystal clear by removing the air bubbles in a vacuum machine.  Any liquid can have all their bubbles removed in a vacuum machine. Place the liquid in an appropriately wide container (not a bag) inside the vacuum machine. If there is too much liquid in the container, the mixture will boil over and create a mess during the process. Close the chamber and introduce a vacuum; the liquid will start to rise and bubble. Soon after, the initial bubbles will break and the liquid will enter a rolling boil. At this point the vacuum can be released and the liquid will have cleared. This procedure is one scenario where there is no need to pre-chill the product being vacuumed because the desired outcome is to have the product boil.

Thirdly,Simran,Surya\'s doting mother.Wht an enamouring voice??Needless to mention her versatility.The love she has on her husband and the affection she has on her son proves her versatility once again.She has really made her impact on the film.
Formal vs informal education »   My sister Mimi and I are opposite in many ways. She was a straight A student and I was a solid B student. She seemed to be able to focus and get through her schoolwork easily where I struggled.   My sister ended up with her choice of any university she wanted to go to and ended up first at Harvard and then at Stanford and is now in the midst of an academic career.   I, on the other hand, was unable to get into any of my first choice universities and ended up dropping out after a few years. I was later convinced to go back to university again by a well known physicist I was working with and dropped out again after becoming disillusioned with formal education as well as my ability to pay attention and learn anything. (I also discovered the amazing community that was the Chicago nightlife scene of the late 80s.)   I think it\'s fair to say that the most important thing that I learned in my formal education was touch typing in junior high school and possibly the importance of camaraderie and athletics during high school wrestling.   Despite my completely dysfunctional relationship with formal learning, I\'ve been able to learn enough to run companies, give talks and be allowed to go to some of the same conferences as my sister.   I was talking to my sister whose research focus is learning and digital media. We were discussing formal learning versus informal learning and how I probably survived because I had the privilege of having access to smart people and mentors, the support of an understanding mother, an interest driven obsessive personality and access to the Internet. I completely agree that improving formal education and lowering dropout rates is extremely important, but I wonder how many people have personalities or interests that aren\'t really that suited for formal education, at least in its current form.  I wonder how many people there are like me who can\'t engage well with formal education, but don\'t have the mentors or access to the Internet and end up dropping out despite having a good formal education available to them. Is there a way to support and acknowledge the importance of informal learning and allow those of us who work better in interest and self-motivated learning to do so without the social stigma and lack of support that is currently associated with dropping out of formal education?   Or... is the answer to make formal education more flexible and capable of supporting a wider spectrum of types of learning to enable people like me to\'make it through the system\'? O,\'ly, as my informal education has finally started to reach limits in certain areas, I find myself increasingly reaching out to formal education institutions for the rigor and depth that I need to explore my areas of interest.
The comments on any youtube video are many times the best part of that video. I wouldn\'t say that\'s the case with I AM DRUGS however. The talented folks involved in making these short, fake PSA\'s precludes them from low balling the viewer. That said, most of the vids in this series consistently get passed around, and every few months, a few of them receive another 20,000 or so hits seemingly over night.   And when they do, the next day is like Christmas morning for us here at Drink at Work.  Based on the comments, it seems that perhaps 10% of the viewers understand the videos are a joke. The rest are fiercely angry at what they believe to be government anti-drug propaganda... or even better, the misinformation they claim we\'re sharing.   Mostly it\'s the pot heads who get riled up, but lately the PCP crowd and the DM42 fans have been chiming in with their own personal experiences with these respective substances.   None of which matters. What does matter is that these people are insane, numerous, and love to have fights on our youtube vid comments sections. And here is some of that magic for you today
Black and white does not scare us. It\'s the grey things that are scary. They are the ones that defy classification. They are the ones you want to classify as white, yet in your heart you know they could as well be black. What happened that day was a gray thing, a dark gray thing if you will. My native place is Paravaicheri which is a village about 50 Km south of Chennai. Almost every weekend I used to take a bus from Koyambedu bus stand at about 8 PM. I would reach my village at about 9 30 PM. I had to walk 2 km from the high way to reach my house. I had lived in the village for most of my life, till I came to Chennai to join college. I got a job in Chennai after finishing college. So effectively for almost four and half years I had undertaken this journey almost every weekend and there had never been any event of significance save for a couple of bus breakdowns. So that day, as I boarded the bus late at 9 PM, surprised to find it so empty, I had no reason to doubt that my journey was going to be any different this time. There were hardly seven people in the bus including the conductor and driver. I put on my headset and started listening to songs on my Sony Ericcson.  Two men who were sitting two rows ahead of me were conversing about whether or not the world will end in 2012. I increased the volume in my phone to tune out their voices. I closed my eyes after setting alarm for 10 PM. The constant roaring of the engine served as a perfect lullaby as I dozed off within five minutes, oblivious of the impending nightmare. I woke up with a disturbed feeling after ten minutes. I blinked. The interior of the bus was dark. And I noticed the glowing letters in the panel behind the driver:  I was amused that I had not noticed it before. It was pitch dark outside and it beat me why they would want to switch off the lights inside the bus. I saw that the two people in the seats two rows ahead of me were still. The rhythmic sound of the engine sounded lonelier than silence. I turned back to see the conductor and was shocked to see that he was in the seat behind me and his eyes were fixed on me and there was a smile pasted in his face. Yes, it was pasted because it did not grow or fade in intensity.  \'Why are the lights switched off?\' He did not seem to have heard me though I spoke from the seat in front of his. He kept staring into my eyes, his lips frozen in an eternal smile. There were green fields on either side of the road for as far as I could see. The green was barely visible in the moonlight though and The only light in the road was the bus\'s head lights and the highway seemed to be deserted and no other vehicle passed in either direction. I looked out through the window and noticed there were no lights on the road either. I did not remember such a long stretch in the road without lights. And it was then that I noticed that the bus was going through a street, a mu,\'y path and not a tar road. Now I would have definitely noticed it in all the years of travel.  \'This bus goes to Thindivanam right?\' I asked in panic. And I turned to see the conductor still smiling at me with resolve. I did not understand whether he was trying to be funny or something was wrong. I simply stood up and went up to the two people sitting two rows ahead of me. In the darkness of the bus, I could not see their face. I asked them the same question. One of them looked up. I took out my mobile phone to shine the light on him, but found it had switched off.   \'Tell me a number between one and ten.\' He said.  I blinked assuming I had heard him wrong.   \'No. I was asking about the bus. Where does it go? I thought it went to Thindivanam.\'  \'Tell me a number between one and ten.\' He repeated and every intonation in the sentence sounded just like it had when he asked the previous time. I kept looking at him wondering if he had teamed up with the conductor to play a prank on me.  When he repeated the same sentence with exact same intonation of the syllables, I knew this wasn\'t normal.
Then arose a cry for equality, from men and women courageous enough to stand up to their oppressors. And then began a battle without. This battle was of little consequence until men and women of all types could set aside their differences and accept their humanity as their first identity, their equality as a matter of course. Slowly, the tides turned. People became more tolerant. And yet the battle was not won. It is not won. Often, equality has been confused with bland conformity, which resulted in socialist and marxist movements. Noble were their ideals and yet, as history has shown, they were doomed to fall. In hindsight, this is obvious, because every man and woman seeks to be different, to stand out from the crowd, to achieve a higher station in society, to be appreciated. At the same time, man strives for acceptance among his peers and in comes the necessity for conforming to social norms. In my opinion, neither extreme is likely to succeed.
To Nine. Thursday, 11 March 2010 It is three minutes to nine. Soon the pendulum will strike true west, and mark another hour washed into the abyss of lost time condemned to eternal waste. Still I sit here active in inaction; pondering over my seventeen inch prison bars taunting me with meaningless pixilation of lights.  Three minutes past nine. Six wasted minutes over three pointless sentences. Inspiration still hid behind the inexorable walls of Hadrian. The light of words-smiting lost behind barbarity of procrastination.  Six minutes past nine. I wonder about the curious day past. Predicate, Delegate; I am drowning in my own world of algorithmic hypnotism.  Tab, Tab, Enter, Type, Tab, Enter, Type, Tab, F5, Tab, Tab, Tab, Crash; eighteen minutes past nine and I am writing absolute nonsense.

scammed!!!!   ok... this is what i want you to do... imagine with me here... it wont be hard, trust me   you were tired, frustrated, so much that you almost gave a serious thought to becoming a hippie (also known as junkie in some cultures), but only got drunk and puked and lost all hope and you drowned in the alcohol swirl (you know what i mean, its hard to put that in words, i\'m talking about the feeling where you feel like sleeping and wanting to stay awake and not say anything but talk to someone all at the same time, you know, yes you do... ). morning, woken up by a phone call (stay with me, the realization of the situation is necessary to justify what is gonna happen)... yes this is him...huh...\'you have just been chosen to be the winner of a 1000$ gift card and that it\'ll be sent to you, just give your a,\'ress for shipping\'... shock, pause, brainwaves: could this be finally one of those moments when the stint of bad luck is over and the wheels have finally turned and the\'new day\'has dawned, and you say what the heck why not. If the situation was any different I would\'ve analyzed the whole situation and observed the fact that she mentions that i was chosen in a draw conducted by VISA, the company that is on your credit card, of which i hold a debit card, and they already have my a,\'ress on file, so why bother calling me n asking something which they should already know? But, as it turns out, $1000 is a pretty big amount, and its just a,\'ress, what\'re they gonna do, send me a packet of Anthrax??!!!  Here, can i sleep now??!! No, you have also won along with it a subscription for 2 magazines every week, and you need to chose which magazines from a list of 60. Hmmm... ok... how bad can it be?!! I can always use some magazines, they look good in your bathroom, which also has a toilet, and a flush tank, with cover, over which you can keep them!! So what do you have!?? ESPN (sports, hmmm, a way to gain enough knowledge to stop those ManU fans in their tracks when they get offensive, which they always are, because they feel pity for the team that died, and think that they have somehow resurrected from ruins, and what not, sure they are on top of EPL, but thats because they have a lot more money, which is because of you (manU fans) !!), and National Geographic traveller (ooh, that\'d be good, I can atleast learn about the places where I would go when I have enough money to buy Hawaii!!), GQ (now that was literally born to be in a bathroom!!!), etc etc (you thought I\'m gonna list all 60 didn ya??)   now wait a second and i\'ll connect ya to our sales department... sure... hi this is AssHole, how can i help ya... well i was connected by AssHole(female), (something you\'ll notice, these guys always make sure they mention their names, like they are very unique and somehow is a sign of gaining trust, hello sir, good morning, this is Ben, how can i help ya, well i feel so comfortable already that i want to ask if he is the ben from Ben 10??!!), and she was mentioning about some magazine n some gift card. Yes, i\'d be glad to help you now, let me explain, you can chose 3 magazines every week, you just have to pay for the delivery, which is 3.45$ a week, and you can get the magazines for the next 60 months (5 yrs!!!), now to make your life easier, we will charge you 50$ every month for the next 20 months, and pay nothing for the next 40. Now i can go ahead and book your order right now, would you like to use a VISA or a MasterCard?!!  ok hold, i thought this was free, m not gonna give my credit card number to someone who just called me in the morning and promise to send me something, and ask for it, what did you say the name of your company is?!! Blue whale publications, me googling as soon as he said it, and sure enough, more scam alerts than a legit website... thank you sir for your offer, but i\'ll buy those magazines myself...   This is a post intended to increase awareness, and protect your personal identity, and your money, and your sanity, and your account, and your money, oh i said that already... so thats all that you can save...   Me in my last 6 months here in the United States have been either a victim of or was almost a victim of about 4 scams/mishaps. sure enough, m gonna put em all up, after all my biggest fans, Me n Myself, deserve to know about it...  PS: Nothing mentioned in this post is fictional...
UK to forbid Open WiFi   FON can help  As ZDNET reported, the UK government will not make an exception with its proposed Digital Economy Bill for public institutions offering \'Open WiFi\'. The Digital Economy Bill intends to crackdown on illegal downloads of copyright protected data. The bill suggests that ISPs could shut down a subscriber\'s internet connection if the subscriber has repeatedly committed copyright infringement via his internet connection.   These penalties not only apply to individual subscribers, but also to institutions and businesses who leave their WiFi open to guests or members. This means, if a bar-owner leaves his WiFi open, and a customer accesses the internet and downloads content illegally, the bar owner will be held responsible. The ISP could even temporarily suspend the subscription. The same is true for libraries, universities and all kinds of shops. So, de facto, this would mean an end to open and unprotected WiFi in the UK.  That is bad news for anybody who wants to offer WiFi to their guests!  But, the good news is that FON can help!  FON service is unaffected by this bill as we comply with all the requirements of the UK government. FON does not offer open and anonymous WiFi access to the internet, but controls the access. Users who log on to FON need to be registered with FON. We know their identity confirmed by payment details such as credit card or phone number. We comply with all requirements of the UK Telco Regulation and collaborate with authorities if requested to identify copyright infringement cases. Just like other hotspot operators.  So, all a bar, café, shop or institution needs to do is use our Fonera WiFi router instead of an WiFi router with \'open WiFi\'. With a Fonera router, anyone can offer WiFi safely to their customers and not have to worry about copyright or other infringements. FON manages the access to the network.  The Fonera+ is available for purchase in the UK for just £29.95 at our FON Shop.
Living a Purposeful life A pianist without a piano, a businessman without business, a coach without trainee, a temple without deity, food without nutrients, a music without rhythm, a book without knowledge and a life without purpose are same. They are not what they are. They looses their relevance.  When the river is bound between two banks and flow to its source, its a river and when the banks are dissolved and there is are no direction it become flood. Same resource which is so life supporting may become the cause of destruction to self and around. Isn\'t it! Same is the case when life force energy has no purpose and its wondering in this world its like flooded river, all over the places. Purpose is like banks which makes a river, river; similarly purpose makes life a LIFE!  If you look around you might find their are three kind of people to this reference One- who doesn\'t bother about this topic, who doesn\'t care about having a purpose. For them life is eat, sleep, dance and die. For them life is routine everyday and life is driven by sensual requirement or sensual pleasures. Two- who have some purpose in their life. They want to accomplish in this life. Three- who have rose above this and know there is no purpose. We are here to celebrate the life, to be witness to the existence.  There is huge difference between the quality of consciousness of the first and third case. Sometime people get into conceptual knowledge and become inert, dull and lethargic saying that there is no purpose to this life, they are basically running away from outer dynamism which exhibit the selfless service with inner peace. To reach to this stage of selfless service one goes through the active dynamism which exhibits self-motivated goals (2nd stage). Most of time mind get stuck into the strong matrix (Maya) created by society or this world and start living in illusion of having a purpose which is nothing but conditioning given by society. For example when you say you want to be doctor because everybody is my class for medical school or you really want to be a doctor? or you want to get married because in society everybody is getting married or you really want to get married? You want to go for shopping why because everybody is going or you really want it? You want to earn money because you need money or everybody does that so you need to do? Do you see there is huge difference in actions also.  I remember a very interesting story which put some light about the discussion. Once the Creator of this creation thought enough of drama done. Lets dissolve this creation and universe. He called for a meeting and all creatures animals, plants, mosquitoes, butterflies, tiger, horses, cow, humans, billion of creatures, everybody came. Then, He sai,\'dnow I want to dissolve this creation since there is no purpose but before that I want to ask you all about your purpose. Do you want to share.\'Everybody sai,\'dYES.\'Then He asked butterflies what is your purpose.  Butterflies said we are here so that we can a,\' color to this creation make the garden more beautiful. Everybody cheered.  Then He asked flowers what is your purpose of existence.  Flower replied so that I can a,\' fragrance and beauty to existence. Again everybody clapped and cheered.  Then He asked donkeys what is your purpose.  Donkeys replied so that we can help humans to carry their weights we are useful for transportation.  Same way God went around and ask all the creation and everybody a,\'ed something or the other. Then He came to Humans and asked what is your purpose of existence and there was deep silence. No humans knew why they are here. They started asking each other do you know, do you know? When no answer came then God turned to other animals, plants and asked them do you what is the purpose of human being? Then everybody was shouting yes I know, yes I know, flowers were shouting yes we know why humans are here, river was saying yes I know why humans are here, even donkeys were telling yes I know why humans are here. And story end. Do you see what this story tell us.
Here\'s an idea that is just begging to be implemented as a Firefox extension.  You know how there\'s a while-you-type spell checker that\'s always on when you are editing text in a multi-line text box? There should be a feature that takes the last few words you\'re typing (or the entire current paragraph, or whatever works best), does a Google search, and presents snippets for the top few results in an unobtrusive pop-up window.  Sure, maybe you\'re thinking\'It looks like you\'re writing a letter. Do you want me to write it for you?\'(the Microsoft paperclip). But using web search instead of a fixed set of patterns could actually make this useful. Imagine the number of messages to customer support forums that will never have to be sent because this feature pops up the answer the user was looking for. And so on.  You might also think,\'this already exists, it\'s called Google auto-suggest.\'But I specifically want it to work when I\'m not (yet) actively searching, but just writing. (If it already existed, it might have stopped me from writing this blog post. :-) Twitter might also become a different place if users realized how many others have already entered the same item.  Of course there\'s a little privacy issue. But still, if this existed, I\'d opt in! (In fact, I did half a dozen searches while I was typing this. How much easier it would be if I didn\'t have to select text, switch to a different tab, paste, and hit enter, losing my writing context each tim.
Scumbag. He would brook no protest or discussion, cutting us off with\'This is not a theology class\'. Hope you read this someday. Your attempts at indoctrination were transparent to most of us- we used to discuss them after class. Don\'t get me wrong. I used to play the guitar in the choir daily, and on every Friday, join the boys\' choir in singing praises to Christ. Somehow, in that seemingly nonsecular school, there was still a separation of Church and\'state\'. That balance, of course, was changed by Mr. Easwaran. Su,\'enly, we had an authority figure teaching us the history of the world from the viewpoint of one religion. Even in an inherently Christian nation like the United States, a similar incident created such a furor. In multi-religious Hindu majority India, surprisingly, nobody heard about it. Not one person bothered. The same scene is being repeated in many Indian schools. Does it matter? Hinduism seems yet undecided on its stance on whether it is an organized religion or a way of life; whether it is an\'it\', in the sense of an ancient religion whose adherents are slowly being outnumbered in its last bastion, is still open to debate.
Maiden Walk - Flow of the wind seemed to halt It was a mere glance ready to waltz Confused for a second,I asked a question Are they her eyes or two oceans Divine those eyelids envisaged being grace Altered to lissome as they glimpsed my face   An hour has passed,with no moment to spare Waiting for our buses with heart refusing to dare Adorned dusk amplified by the dulcet rain But I am in loss and those aqua drops in gain Bestrewed was that coy face with water droplets And those bare arms seemed eager to melt   Now my heart is nothing but a hostage Was it almighty who set up this stage My foot rebelled and I knew not the path But I was ensconced in the alluring swath Distance between us is now less than a feet This visceral journey made me ready to greet   That angelic face is touched by my hand And my lips are over her humble eyes Being Witnessed by several constellation We are now each others destination
Hey folks,  I have asked the kind people at GoComics to do away with the ANGRY EYEBROWS comic for good. Put simply, it was an experiment that just didn\'t work out. I know this comes as disappointing news to a lot of you, but this year is all about trimming the bacon fat and parlaying my talents into projects that I can be excited about.  THE ANGRY EYEBROWS COMIC CONCERN is still something I\'m interested in pursuing, but not as a gag-a day comic. The plan I have in mind would be more of a web portal highlighting the current comics I\'m working on, including animation projects and iPod/iPad/iPhone apps.  Thanks for those who followed the short AE experiment. More things to come in 2010.  -FRS
After a busy few weeks I feel a little human again. Owlcon was pretty damn good this year. It\'s been a while since I\'ve been very involved with gaming conventions so it was nice to actually run a game or two this year. My convention bu,\'y, Marcel, didn\'t make it out with me this year. My dad had some time off from work and things just worked out that it fell on Owlcon weekend. While I was a little sad to not have him at Owlcon with me, it\'s nice knowing he enjoys spending time with my dad. I\'m happy knowing he\'s getting to know just how great of guy my dad really is. He was slotted to run a game of Heroscape this year but I managed to wheel in all three bags by myself and tossed together a quick map that made more than a few people stop for picture or two. While I may have thought it a little sad compared to maps Marcel and I have built in the past, most people who saw it thought it was pretty neat. Next year will be massive. I\'m going for height next year, and lots of roads.
How wasteful is life when you have nothing to do. How insincere one feels, how helpless and inadequate. One must keep doing. Does not matter whether it is big or small, just keep doing it. Someday someone shall recognize it. Credit is not what one would want to look for. The quality and intensity of the work is important. Credit becomes personal, individual. It shall remain within one, whereas the work done should be devoid of that individuality, should be more universal and all encompassing, including and identifiable with the common man or woman. For their benefit and well being. VK Murthy, the ace cinematographer has been awarded the Dada Sahib Phalke Award this year. The highest honor reserved for the film fraternity by the establishment. Generally and till now, mostly it has been given to decorate better known stars and directors, never a technician. But I do not consider myself worthy of his genius. His most important works I believe were in films made by another genius, Guru Dutt.
This may be a meandering ramble of a blog, because i don\'t know what to type today. Hope you all had a nice late december stressful family hell season, and that you got at least one present worth putting on ebay. Just been looking thru my comment moderation options, apparently people seem to think that because i write a blog, i should write something significant and useful. Well, knickers. My blog is extremely useful to someone who may perhaps need to read these words or die. Or if they need a website window open to maximize, covering the porn you were looking at when the missus walked in. So there.  Of course, the significance of this comment seems to have been ruined by the anonymous (obviously the same person) fuck you comments posted later. So, yeah, that\'s why i\'ve got comment moderation. This really is gonna be a ramble blog... Hmmm... Oh, we had another baby and you probably already know that. She is megan and her favourite ps3 game is Stuntman Ignition, which entertains her more than a box full of vtech tat. SNOW! There was snow and it was fun. Then it was shit. Then it was ice and all the idiot drivers crashed their cars, then it was good again and we could leave the house. And that\'s the weather. I am eating mini cornish pasties. They don\'t appear to have any meat in them. They do have what seems to be plasterboard inside. And carrot. So that\'s one of my five a day.
So I\'m pretty obsessed with sharing. I used to be in the cult of beautiful objects and I would take photographs and go into a color darkroom and make giant c-prints.  Then I found flickr and my grandpa gave me his old digital camera and I started taking lots of pictures and sharing them. That was when I joined the legions of sharers. I got a major buzz when people left comments. I was hooked. I discovered Creative Commons and Open Source culture and the EFF became my personal heroes.  I shared video too, first it was personal stuff, like video tours around my Seattle apartment. Later I started sharing infrastructure for people to make things and that was really fun.  Now at MakerBot we\'re sharing a machine that you put together that is an object enabler. We share all the plans for it and set up a website called Thingiverse where folks can share their own digital designs for physical objects. It\'s my favorite thing to look at in the morning and see what new designs have been shared!  As a culture, we\'re figuring out that sharing is great. We\'re communicating and developing infrastructure like wildfire to find new ways to share our thoughts, ideas, designs, photos, videos, and pretty much anything you can think of.  I see sharing as the future of education. It used to be that in order to learn something you had to go to an institution. Now, because people are sharing how they do things and their knowledge on things, learning is often as easy as googling something.
Hello I\'m back.  My current weapon of choice is Java though.  The renderer supports: median split BVH, thin lens and pinhole camera models, sphere and Triangle primitives, naive path tracing with lambertian surfaces only, rendering in a progressive manner. Performance is not that bad. I designed it to take full advantage of the new feature of java called Escape Analysis, so I\'m not reusing objects (what leads to ugly code btw.) but creating them like crazy.  What sucks though is that there is no 1.6.0_14 java for Mac OS X yet, but I\'ve tested in on windows and it works very well.  Some first, naive path tracing, renderings:
Pressure Cooked Stock 2: Changing Pressures, Playing with Chemistry January 27th, 2010 · Uncategorized  posted by Dave Arnold     This is our second post on the benefits and pitfalls of pressure cooking stocks. See the first post here.     We recently bought a fancy new pressure cooker, in which to do fancy new tests. It\'s actually a pressure canner/sterilizer—which lets me work with higher volumes and with higher pressures. First we investigated which pressures are best for cooking chicken stock and veal stock.  Second,  we tested to see if we could increase flavor extraction by treating stocks with a strong base. This test was suggested  by our reader Schinderhannes,  and it turned out to be a doozy.     Our fancy new pressure device, the All American Sterilizer, 25 quart. A Brief Recap    The right pressure cookers can make stocks that are superior to traditional stocks.  In our tests, pressure cookers that vent steam while cooking made stocks that were browner and had better aroma than traditional stocks—but they tasted worse, were less balanced, and were more muted than traditional stocks.  Pressure cookers that did NOT vent steam beat conventional stocks by all criteria.  I know, it\'s counterintuitive that the vented pressure cooked stocks would have better aroma  but taste worse (wouldn\'t the aroma have vented off?), but we verified our results with repeated blind tastings.      Our Iwatani pressure cooker regulates pressure by venting steam. The gauge on the right is unreliable and cannot be trusted to regulate pressure. It seems like pressure cooked stock should always beat traditional stock because:   There isn\'t much turbulence inside a pressure cooker, so cloudiness is reduced. Higher extraction temperatures extract flavor more completely. Higher temperatures encourage more delicious \'high temp flavors,\' such as the meaty flavors caused by increased protein breakdown. The sealed pressure cooker should preserve volatiles. Why venting pressure cookers underperform is still a mystery to me.  But they always do.  A Note on our New Pressure Cooker The Wisconsin Aluminum Foundry Company (WAFCO) has been making the \'All American\' line of pressure canners since 1930. Their pressure canners are made entirely of aluminum and are usually big (up to 41 quarts). Pressure canners are designed primarily to sterilize jars and cans for home canning—not to cook in. The standard pressure canner regulates pressure with an adjustible weight, so once working pressure is reached, it vents steam—bad. You can make the weight heavier and use the very nice and accurate gauge to regulate pressure up to about 18 or 19 psi without venting, but to really go high-pressure you want a pressure sterilizer. Pressure sterilizers are used by dentists and tattoo artists; they are basically inexpensive autoclaves.  Our WAFCO canner converts to a sterilizer just by changing out the lid.   We have the 25 quart stovetop model.     Sterilizer Top. The valve on the right can be flipped off and on to vent as desired, but won\'t leak steam till you hit 25 psi. Be careful. On sterilizers this valve is connected to a long tube inside the pot. If the tube is underwater, pressurized hot liquid will spray everywhere when the lid is vented. The pressure sterilizer will not vent  steam unless you release the valve or take the unit above 24.5 psi. It is dead quiet. A regular pressure cooker at 15 psi reaches 250° F (121° C). My pressure sterilizer running at 24.5 psi reaches 266° F (130 ° C).      The All American Sterilizer gauge. This gauge works. Here it is reading 24.5 psi which equals a blistering 266° F (130° C). Any more pressure and the sterilizer auto vents. The 25 quart pot heats rather slowly, and it takes a while to get the hang of regulating pressure by adjusting the gas—I plan to build a temperature regulator soon. Be careful with the sterilizer. It has a tube on the bottom of the lid. If that tube goes under the surface of your cooking liquid, the vent valve will spray hot liquid when opened. In these tests we cooked our food in stainless bains that we put inside the pressure sterilizer.    One quirky feature of these pots: they have a  metal-on-metal seal, with no rubber gasket.      The All American sterilizers and pressure canners use an all-metal gasketless seal. Test Number 1, Changing Pressures     We ran this test on previously prepared stocks so we could eliminate ingredient variables.  The tests discussed in our first pressure post indicate that pressure cooking a previously prepared stock produces similar results to creating a stock entirely in the pressure cooker.   We treated white chicken stock and brown veal stock  in five different ways, as follows:     Heat briefly on the stove (control 1). Pressure cook in a venting pressure cooker at 15 psi for 30 minutes (control 2). Pressure cook at 15 psi for 30 minutes. Pressure cook at 20 psi for 30 minutes. Pressure cook at 24 psi for 30 minutes.  Pressure tasting: Brown veal stock on top, white chicken stock on the bottom. 15 psi non-vented was the winner, followed by regular. You can see that higher pressures = browner color.  Chicken and veal stocks reacted similarly at the same pressures, so I\'ll discuss them together.  Confirming our previous results, stovetop was better than 15 psi vented, but not as good as 15 psi.  The aroma of 15 psi vented was superior to both stovetop and 15 psi unvented—bizzare. 20 psi had a good aroma, some thought better than 15 psi unvented, but its taste was muted.  The 24 psi stock was the brownest by far, but smelled and tasted dead.  We need to run tests between 0 and 15 psi to determine optimum pressure.    Result:  15 psi non-vented chicken and veal stocks were the winners.    Test Number 2, A,\'ing Lye:     This one gets a little weird. Friend of the blog and pro-chemist Schinderhannes suggested that we try to increase the meaty flavor of stocks by disrupting the proteins with a strong base (like sodium hydroxide, also known as lye), pressure cooking them, and neutralizing the base with a strong acid (like hydrochloric acid).   Don\'t get freaked out, we aren\'t serving this to people—it was just a test.    There\'s something very appealing about Shinderhannes\' proposal.   Lye ( NaOH) + Hydrochloric acid (HCl) combine to make water and table salt (H2O and NaCl).  The trick to not poisoning people is neutralizing the lye.    We don\'t have access to high grade lye, so we used this:     100% lye drain cleaner. Lye is NaOH. Don\'t do this at home. Don\'t use this stuff.  I don\'t want to hear about you getting hurt. Eating only a small crystal will do severe,  irreparable damage to your insides.  My doctor mom used to tell me horror stories of kids who came into the ER after eating drain cleaner. Anyway, we prepared two identical batches of chicken meat and water, a,\'ed some 33% lye solution to one (we a,\'ed 0.5% by weight NaOH to the stock), and pressure cooked them both for 45 minutes in a non-venting pressure cooker at 15 psi.  Here is what they looked like:     Two pressure-cooked stocks, normal on the left, with a,\'ed lye on the right. The difference is pretty plain.  The lye stock is still poisonous at this point so we need to a,\' hydrochloric acid to neutralize it.  Problem is, I can\'t get pure hydrochloric acid, so I went to the hardware store for muriatic acid, which is fairly concentrated HCl, used to clean tiles.  We a,\'ed enough HCl to get a neutral reading on our pH meter.  Look what happened:     Pouring in acid to neutralize the lye-stock caused a weird precipitation reaction. Whoa! The stock turned white and clouded up.  I tasted it to make sure it wasn\'t poison.  It wasn\'t.  Then we figured out how much salt to a,\' to the normal stock to match the salt created in the lye stock acid base reaction.     Our chemistry set: Muriatic Acid Tile Cleaner (HCl), 100% Lye Drain Cleaner Solution (NaOH). Kosher salt (NaCl), pH Meter, Buffer Solutions. Here is Nastassia tasting them blind.     Since the stocks looked very different we tasted with our eyes closed. Well, the normal stock won.  The lye stock tasted a little weird.  The next day the lye stock looked even stranger:      After resting overnight, the lye stock (on the right) had a bunch of goop floating in it and smelled of lye. The stock on day 2 smelled and tasted strongly of lye.  I\'m  guessing the lye was trapped in the precipitate that formed when we a,\'ed the acid, and it leached out overnight.  The lye taste was still present after we got rid of the cloudy stuff in our centrifuge.   All in all, not a ready-for-prime-time technique, but a fun experiment.  ? 30 CommentsTags:chicken·lye·pressure canner·pressure cooking·stocks·veal  Whole Fish à la Cooking Issues January 21st, 2010 · Uncategorized  posted by Dave Arnold   Pretty picture of a fish in oil Cooking a large whole fish is challenging.  It\'s easy to overcook the outside, leave the inside raw, or both. This problem keeps cropping up for me. You see, my stepfather Gerard has three interests: drinking wine, smoking cigars, and  surf casting for striped bass. He\'s an accomplished fisherman, and he catches nice big guys  36-40 inches — along the beaches of Cape Cod, whereupon he delivers them to me. When I cook for my family,  I like to cook family style. I want to serve a fish whole, and naturally I want to serve it fried. For years I just bent the suckers into a \'U\', dusted them with flour, and chucked them in my deep fryer. They were good, but, truth be told, the outside was overdone and the inside wasn\'t really done at all. No one noticed because I served pla pad prik style, with a generous amount of spicy Thai curry.  But Nils and I have worked out a better technique with the miracle of low temperature cooking (low-temp and sous-vide primer soon to come).  Many fish, like salmon and mackerel, don\'t hold up well when cooked for a long time at low temperatures.  Their enzymes keep working while the fish is cooking, breaking down the muscle and making it mushy.  The same holds true for crustaceans.  Some of these fish also taste terrible when they\'re cooked to safe bacteria-killing termperatures:  Salmon served warm, for example, shouldn\'t be cooked much above 50 C for taste, but anything below 50 C is actually growing bacteria. Stripers, however, are made for low temp cooking. They don\'t deteriorate in the 2.5 hours it takes to cook them low temp. and they do fine cooked all the way up to 57 C  a perfectly safe temperature.   So how do you low-temp a striper?  They won\'t fit in a vacuum machine and you don\'t want to poach them.  A striper just fits into the wide roll foodsaver bags, and for a while this is how we cooked them.  I\'ve been told that few things are more amusing than watching Nils and me try to get the foodsaver to vacuum the air out of a 42 inch long food saver bag that\'s  bent into a U and full of fish and oil.   The \'U\' is a necessity: otherwise the fish won\'t fit in the fryer.  One serendipidous day we had to cook a striper and we couldn\'t locate any foodsaver bags — so we just filled our circulator bath with oil.  Easy, delicious, though more expensive (cause you need all that oil).  It\'s our preferred method now, and here it is on a 40 inch striper:
I did manage to pick up a new-but-old hobby. When Lana and I first got married we moved away to the far away land of Tennessee. I was just a newly promoted PV2, straight out of AIT, at my first duty station and neither of us knew anyone. Before we made friends with the people I worked with at the hospital, we found puzzles when we ventured out at 3am at Walmart. Looking back, it was really a pretty darn wonderful time. It was just us and we were both on my night shift schedule. We\'d sleep all day and spend the whole evening together watching movies, playing scrabble, or putting puzzles together. On my off rotation we\'d pack up and head out for three or four days and forget I was in the Army. I even have the Article 15 to prove it. Lana bought a big value pack of puzzles at Walmart for us to do as a family. We tackled the small one first. We moved on quickly to the 1,000 piece puzzle. While it may not be what some call fun, I enjoy it. It\'s especially fun when Lana scoots up on the other side of the table. It becomes marvelous curveball of fun when Marcel sits down. Maybe you don\'t get it, but that\'s okay cause I do.
Be Professional..huh (ZeeK vs Aman) This is ZeeK...  Nowadays whenever I press F5, I discover a new Aman, a guy who on last refresh, was cursing someone where no one was their in vicinity and I m sure that on next refresh this guy is gonna kill someone (atleast professionally)..This someone is not a single personality but an entity that comprises some human faces, some computer peripherals and other things that froces me to press F5  I am a virtual existance, I dont know friendship but is it valid to say that\'being professional\'is better than being\'a close friend\'in terms of maintaining relationship with a person (a gal/ a guy..doesn\'t matter.)  As ZeeK, and continously watching Aman.. I wil say that\'If you are professional to a person, you CANT fight with him/her\'. I need 5 bucks and I have 2 options, First one is to ask a person, I know and I just talk to him (Obviously not about the problems I might be facing) or in other words this guy is not my\'close friend\'but we talk as\'so called friend\'. (Can I say we are professionals??? ). The other option is to ask a friend of mine who has already given me more than 1000 bucks for my mess bill (which was given long back say 2 years back) and has not yet asked for that as he knwos that I wil retrun him one day. I can straight away go to the later one and ask for money without thinking ne crap like illustrated here and their is no chance that this guy wil not give me money ( I meant, If he has, he wil give for sure) and most importantly I have to still retrun him 1000 instead of 1005. What if I ask the former person for 5 bucks instead of the later personality? I again have almost full chance of getting the money but with an unsaid warning of owing the responsibility of returning it. If I dont return it, I wont b goin to jail but whenever I and this guy face each other, I ll (I think I ll) feel awkward! I took that money for my personal use, I should retrun it. Being a professional I have to retrun it. If its a personal affair, I may not have to retrun it. My friend will never ask money back, neither I ask money back from my friends but what if this is not a matter of 5 bucks, The matter is different (obviously something with higher value, may be something that cant be measured in terms of currency ) but the options remain the same. Do you human think that the later person is a good choice? I think the former should be the choice not only because you should be professional, but also\'you should not loose your friends\'. You ask for help on second matter to a friend of yours and being a friend your friend tries to help you out and in return (in case) u cannot return!! The bond from ionic may turn to covalent depending upon your friend. So Be Professional everywhere...  This is Aman...  ZeeK has gone crazy! I dont think I got any mental problems nowadays! Infact I feel the actual Aman is coming out of me, day by day, as I shout on some1 (the entity some1 ) I feel more of myself. From past few years I think I tried to modify myself but the original nature of mine is best suited for me. I think being short tempered is not bad at times. Mr. ZeeK ... How can you be Professional to your GirlFriend / BoyFriend ???? Now that would be cheating. I dont have ne\'so called girlfriend\'but i dont think that even if I have one in coming future (fortunately), I wil maintain a professional relationship rather than a personal relatinoship. I am not going to choose a girlfriend who wants me to be professional for instance, If I have a GF and she is my GF bcz I am a good teacher then I dont think that this will work out!..Their cant be professionalism involved here atleast!  What if your 5 bucks crap has two options as a gal whom you just know and the second one is your girlFriend ???? Ha! Be Professional and search for other girlfriend! *(depends on your gal although)  To be continued,... Maabdaulat: I am gonna continue the topic\'Every Thing can be justified
Shut Up And Bleed You Mother Fuc-! Out in Utah the last few days working on the game. Some cool pics with a Sweet Tooth mask :)   Me and Scott Campbell (Eat Sleep Play co-founder/co-pres) posing with our boy\'s head. My understanding is a former Incognito employee made this for his Halloween costume back in the day. But this was the first time I\'d ever seen it. It\'s so dang cool!   Me, being a dork :)    Me as dork, Part II :)                  Close up of the mask. Nice detail!!!  Great weekend ya\'ll! I\'m stuck inside tomorrow doing more work for our game. But I don\'t mind- game is going well so it\'s fun to keep cranking :). Plus, I\'ll spend a little time with War/Darksiders. Yes, I am STILL trying to finish it. I thought I was gonna do it last weekend but a little game called GOD OF WAR III hit my inbox and I played that all weekend (finished it too!...when is the last time I finished a game in 1-2 days?!? Probably it was ICO back in tha day!)...  Ok...take it easy, ya\'ll!  David  POSTED BY DA CRIMINAL AT 3:14 PM TUESDAY, MARCH 09, 2010  SUMMARY JUDGEMENT GRANTED    Motion for Summary Judgement Granted...you can read it here if you are so inclined.  Here is the Hollywood Reporter\'s take on the judgement.    POSTED BY DA CRIMINAL AT 4:11 PM SATURDAY, MARCH 06, 2010  GOD OF WAR III THOUGHTS SO FAR... Playing GOD OF WAR 3 this weekend and really, really loving it.   But it being a great game aside, it is an AMAZING and RARE game design learning opportunity. To play a game based on your initial design formula that you had nothing to do with is eye opening! Because for the first time, I can actually see how the game/God Of War formula feels to a normal player! Before this, I could only go off reviews and player reactions and guesses in terms of gauging just what the game really was and how it felt to play. You can try to imagine that experience when you make the game but since you know it so intimately, you never really know what it feels like for a normal member of the audience. You never know how others are actually experiencing it. Now I get to see and know and experience that! What a very cool learning opportunity!    I\'ll post my final thoughts on the game when I finish it (and once it\'s been out a bit) but I can say now that visually and production wise, I really don\'t think there has EVER been a game that has executed at this level! Presentation and production wise, this is a crazy ass bar raising simply staggering game! And the execution of the story telling process? Fucking fantastic (amazing opening credits)! Amazing job all around! NOTE: Not suggesting he new GOW doesn\'t a,\' and change the formula- that\'s up to you to determine- I am just saying the original formula is still present as well and that is what I am talking about.
2. The lines between software, content and media are blurring. This has profound implications on system architecture and revenue models. There will be a prevalence of loosely connected services and MashUps versus tightly integrated software. Your system architecture and design has to accommodate that. We are seeing this today in the growing prevalence of SOA and S+S models (wikipedia these terms!).  3. The above fact fundamentally shifts the revenue model for applications. If your app is made up of disjointed heterogeneous services and content sourced (on-demand) from various entities, there is no longer a basis for a pre-determined cost for the service. The pricing and in turn, the revenue model will now rely on a lot of other factors such as usage, relevance and the all important\'Advertising\', especially if it will reduce the cost of the service to the consumer.  4. Like it or not, advertising is going to be the major revenue source for the new breed of internet based applications - it is a win win for both the parties (consumers and advertisers): The advertisers now see much better returns on their investments since they are reaching their ideal target demographic due to the self-selecting nature of the application and audience. The consumers are happy because a. their costs for use of the application or resource is subsidized or often completely free and b. they are served relevant advertisements for products and services that they may ACTUALLY be interested in given the context.
What Traveling Has Taught Me About Money  Today\'s guest post is from Kyle at OnOurOwnPath, who has been traveling with his wife for over 2 years with no plans of stopping.  If you wonder how they do it, read on     Before my wife and I started being nomads, we weren\'t really budget people. For instance, my idea of a budget would be looking at my checking account to make sure that it was above $0. Money came in, money went out. I didn\'t really know where my money was going to half the time, I just new that I was being paid twice a month and that covered just about everything.  All of this changed, though, when we decided that we wanted to do extended world travel. Obviously, we would need the funds to start doing this, so we started saving money to be able to travel the world. And once we had this money saved, we didn\'t want to go about blowing it on every thing that seemed like a good idea. If we did that, our trip would only last a few months.  So, we started being one of those people who keeps a meticulous budget. You know the type. We write down everything and then record it in a special budget spreadsheet complete with pie charts. Even when we pay 10 cents to use the toilet in Ecuador, we write it down. We then play with the numbers to see how much money we have left and what we could possibly do with it. Yes, we play with spreadsheets for fun.  The funny thing is that this is not a natural part of our personalities. Truthfully, I don\'t think we could have done this if it weren\'t for traveling. One of the unexpected side effects of being on the road has been what we\'ve learned about our money.  Comfort is not expensive  We\'re not the kind of super cheap travelers who sleep in a cockroach-infested hotel. Don\'t get me wrong, we\'ve stayed in places that I wouldn\'t recommend to my parents, but we try to sleep in places that at least try to appear nice. What we\'ve found, though, is that a little extra money goes a long way. For instance in Copacabana, Bolivia we stayed in an immaculate room overlooking Lake Titicaca that we would normally find out of our price range. To compensate for the extra cost while we were there, we decided to spend less money on doing \'tourist\' activities such as tours and more time just walking around and getting to know the area. As a result, we felt like we got to know the town better and had a wonderful time in the process. Of course, it also doesn\'t hurt to wake up to the views of Lake Titicaca every morning.  On the contrary, we\'ve also stayed in name-brand plush hotels which cost about 2-3 times a decent mid-range option. And what have we gotten for the extra price? So far, the only advantage that I can find for staying in plush hotels is that they give away better quality shampoo.  Spending should match priorities  Having a budget is all about making decisions. With only a limited amount of money to spent, we can\'t do everything we want to do all the time. This makes us evaluate what our priorities are and spend our money according to these priorities. One of our priorities while traveling is to understand different cultures and interact with people in those cultures. So, accordingly, we try to spend our money on things that meet this priority instead of spending it on doing things like adventure activities, like white water rafting. We enjoy those activities as well, but it doesn\'t compare to the 3 weeks of learning Spanish and living with a local family in Xela, Guatemala. Having the human connections with our host family and the ongoing connections that we made by speaking Spanish have far outweighed any eye candy that we\'ve come across.  A Little Dose of Perspective Helps  If we\'ve learned nothing else from traveling, it\'s a sense of perspective. It\'s hard for us to justify buying anything expensive when we know that the average Nicaraguan family could live off of that money for months. Just the fact that we can afford to even go to these places to see how other people live indicates that we\'re not exactly strapped for cash.  So, when we do buy things, we try to buy them with our needs in mind. In the Andes of Ecuador, I needed to buy some long sleeves. Instead of trying to find a North Face store, for instance, I opted to get a locally made sweater less for than $10. Sure, the bright green fabric clashed with the rest of my clothes, but it served me well during my time in the high altitude.  Over the past 2 years on the road I can now say that being a budget-minded person is second nature for us. No matter where our path takes us, this habit will stick. It\'s now apart of the fabric of who we are.  When it comes down to it, budgeting is truly not that hard when you can see the truly wonderful things that a little money can do. And we have travel to thank for allowing us to see that.
Each New Year, we wish others happiness and prosperity. What really is the sign of prosperity? There are several   a smile, contentment, freedom, the willingness to share, fearlessness and the trust and confidence that you will get what you need in life. Welcome the New Year with a genuine smile. As you flip the calendar, keep flipping your mind as well. Don\'t fill your future dates with past events. Learn and unlearn from the past, and move on. You want to be free of greed, hatred, jealousy and all such imperfections. Understand that negative emotions are due to the past. Do not let the past affect your life in the present. If you cannot forgive the past, then your future will be miserable. This New Year make up with someone with whom you are not on good terms. Start life afresh. In the New Year, wish peace and prosperity for all. Do selfless service. Live your life well. Realise that your priority is to check violence in the world, free of domestic and societal violence. Make a resolution to do more good, help people in need and bring solace to those suffering. Whenever you are useful to people, merit will never be lost. Any good gesture or action of yours will always come back to you. Today you have the whole world for a family. That\'s what you need to feel, that everybody is part of your own family. Take responsibility. Then there is no suffering. The spiritual dimension of life brings a great sense of belongingness, responsibility, compassion and caring for the whole world, for all life. In its truest form spirituality helps us overcome narrow boundaries of caste, creed, religion and nationality and gives you a broader awareness of life everywhere.Open your eyes and see how much you have been given. Focus on what you have rather than what you don\'t have. The more grateful you are, the more will be given to you. Conversely, the more you complain, the more will be taken away from you. This is what Jesus Christ meant when he said, \'Those who have will be given more; those who don\'t give, and even what they have will be taken away from them.\' With gratitude, reach out and help those who are less endowed. You will get much contentment when you serve selflessly. Then you realise that your problems aren\'t so big after all. The biggest reason for mental depression is the constant refrain of the mind that says, \'What about me?\' This is a sign of lack of prosperity. Become free like a bird. Open your wings and learn to fly. This is something you have to experience within yourself. If you think you are in bondage, you will remain bound here. Be free. When will you experience freedom? After you die? Become free right now. Sit down and become contented. Spend some time in meditation and satsang. This not only calms your mind, your inner self becomes strong enough to deal with challenges. When the mind relaxes, the intellect becomes sharp. When the mind is loaded with ambitions and feverish desires, then the intellect loses its keenness. When intellect and observation are not sharp, life does not express itself fully. Ideas don\'t flow properly and abilities diminish day by day. With this understanding, you step out of your narrow confines and that will solve many of the problems in your life. When you are centred, there is happiness always. With this calmness, talents arise naturally. Intuition comes, beauty comes, peace comes; Love springs up. Prosperity comes.
Getting Motivated Posted by Scott on Mar 12, 2010 in Marketing Today I am presenting you with the opportunity for motivation. Opportunity may knock, but it\'s never going to beat down the door with a battering ram, so you better be listening for the knock. I am going to ask you give yourself a motivational test today, and once a week for the next month. This is opportunity knocking and I need you to be motivated enough to open the door and let it in. Now you know in your mind that the opportunity that\'s knocking will require you to work, right? Don\'t play the \'I\'m going to play like no one is home\' routine because opportunity will not come back to you again. Getting motivated to do something is not an easy task, and for many of us it does not come naturally. Would it be easier for you if I gave you some atta-boy\'s right off the bat? You are a valuable photographer. People in your community place a lot of value in your work. When your clients think of their most valuable possession in their home, the art and memories that you created for them are at the top of their list. OK ego\'s stroked enough because my wrist is getting tired  Seriously now the word \'value\' is an important description of you and your work. The more valuable you are to your clients the more money you get to earn. Notice the word \'earn\' You are earning a living as a photographer.  I am always preaching about identifying your top clients and getting into their networks of family and friends.  Well this time I want you to identify the top clients of yours that really believe in your value to them.  They are going to be your best evangelists.  Many photographers have developed a wishbone where  there spine is supposed to be.  I wish, I wish, I wish  but never an \'I really put my back into it and worked hard to accomplish ______\'  Too much wishy washy crap going on in our industry.  If you want to stroke something three times and make a wish I\'ll give you something to stroke  Probably not the results your hoping for though.  You are never going to win an award for mediocrity so stop trying to.  Look for client trends in your studio.  Where are my best clients from?  Who sent them?  Where can I reach more people like them? I am telling you this stuff works, but it takes some effort at first but trust me it will become effortless in the future.  Every day I hear from photographers that are struggling in this industry but 95% of them are like the fat guy ordering a Big Mac and a Diet coke but wondering why he is not loosing weight.  Working on yourself first and your business second will get you so much further in life.  You are the tool, and the business is what you create with that tool. (not to be confused with \'you are a tool\' that\'s something else)  Being motivated will allow you to focus and accomplish so much more with your business.   Here is the simple test, print this out and keep it on your desk. If I were motivated to improve my life, I would be more ______________________ (insert answer) Fit, reliable, happy, successful, etc . Insert as many as you want.  Put the most important ones first. If I were motivated to improve my life, I would have more ____________________ If I were motivated to improve my life, my business would be more _________________________ If I were motivated to improve my life, what could I offer to others that I\'m not offering now ______________________ I will commit myself to being happier and more motivated. I will take specific actions in my life towards obtaining the items listed above. I wish no more . This week I will complete __________________ (Insert a task you have been wanting to do)  Join me on our 30 days for change.  Fill this out once a week and see if some of your answers change or move positions in the lists.   (your weekly tasks better change)    I know many of you have tons of things that you have been putting off doing, that you know you need to do.  You spend more time thinking about not doing those tasks than it probably actually takes just to do them.  I\'m not just preaching to the choir here I too need to get my act in gear on several things that I keep putting off because I\'m not motivated to complete them.  I am highly motivates towards certain things, but I have an unmotivated bag that I seem to carry around.  I keep putting crap in it that I don\'t want to do until it\'s full and I can\'t close it anymore.  It\'s my man purse!  (metaphorically speaking of course) and it\'s filled with a bunch of little things that I am going to do.  I don\'t know if this will inspire anyone or if it was just good for me to put this challenge out there.  Redefine your life right now.  What do you want and how do your want it?  Now how are you going to get it?  A race is never won if you never take the first step.  Today is your first step . Maybe you won\'t win but I hope you at least reach the finish line.  I want you to be a quitter!  Some people say never quit, never give up  Blah blah blah .  Quit procrastinating, quit smoking, quit eating crap, quit thinking negativly, quit all kinds of bad stuff and start replacing it with the good stuff.  I can\'t light a fire under anyone to get them motivated, they have to pull out their wick and light it themselves.  I can pass the lit match to you, but you have to take it from there.  Now go lite your little wick.
had a very enjoyable debate with Avner Rosen of Boxee yesterday at SXSW.  We tended to go around in circles defending our positions. His (to paraphase): the internet will do what cable and satellite do, but it will do it better. That MicroSoft and Apple among others will in the future come up with new ways to do it all better than we can now.  Mine: Of course the internet can support video, but it cant do it as well as the current digital cable and satellite distributors can, nor is there a profit model that would ever incent content providers to switch their content from the internet to TV.  I wont rehash it all here, but the most salient comment came from the audience when someone asked \'Whats the difference if the gatekeeper MicroSoft/Google/Apple rather than Comcast/Time Warner/Directv/Dish ?\'  Of course the questioner was right.  Bits are bits . The economics of content are going to search for the best place to be monetized, regardless of the delivery platform.  I think the current model will be the place content finds, Avner seemed to feel it would be some future internet.  It shouldn\'t matter.  We both seemed to agree that one of the biggest future changes for the internet will be an increase in bandwidth. The question the needs to be answered is \'how will all the new bandwidth, both on the backbone and in the last mile be used ?
Osama going Green!  Al Qaida leader Osama Bin Laden has called in a new audiotape for the world to boycott American goods and the US dollar, blaming the United States and other industrialized countries for global warming. In the tape, Bin Laden warns of the dangers of Climate change and says that the way to it is to bring\'the wheels of the American economy\'to a halt.  Wow! So now the\'World\'s Most Wanted\'man is also talking about Global Warming - now that sounds interestingly ironical to me. He is the same person who masterminded the 9/11 attacks, killing around 3000 people!! He has also been linked with numerous terrorist activities across the world. So is it right on his part to talk about Global Warming?  Showing concern for the future generations after all the atrocities that he has committed in the past... talk about hypocrisy...  Everything said, i am quite excited about doing an intensive research on global warming in quest for its authenticity. Expect a post on it latest by Monday.  love, Si,\'harth
I set out to write an article about the unique features of XNA Game Studio on Windows Phone 7 Series, but while trying to populate my outline, I realized, wow, there actually aren\'t many things different about Game Studio 4.0 on the phone compared to Windows and Xbox 360! That\'s bad news for this article, but I think good news for our platform as a whole. With Game Studio 4.0, we made a concerted effort to increase portability and consistency across our target platforms.  In some areas it was obvious how to achieve consistency. For instance, Windows Phone 7 Series includes a Zune media client, so we could port our existing Zune media APIs. Input is similarly straightforward. If you only want to access a single touch point, you can use our existing Mouse API. If you need multitouch (the phone supports four simultaneous touches), you can use an API similar to what we previously shipped for Zune HD. This touch API works on Windows 7 PCs with multitouch displays, too.  Other areas, especially graphics, were more challenging to design. Had we just ported the Game Studio 3.1 graphics API, we would have been left with a confusing mess of non-overlapping caps that would make it hard to port code between Windows, Xbox, and the phone. But we didn\'t want to force a lowest common denominator approach: it would make no sense to limit Xbox 360 games to only those features which are also available on mobile hardware!
Action Life is all about our own actions.  Actions are ,\'each and every\'thing we do.Actions are the result of composition of different things, such as\'Condition\',\'Choice\',\'Habit\', which favour the final action. Every individual action depends upon these three things. People will do the things if its their habit, or if the condition is favouring them to do so or if its the choice they have made for themselves for their good. So one person can admire you and another can be a person who treats you bad, or irritates you, does something wrong, will be considered as a bad person. But he is acting according to his condition, habit and mostly choice. According to him he is as good as Shri Rama in Ramayana. So all good and bad things are perspective.  Every thing in this world depends upon the action. One\'s action can create some condition for another. One can regret about his own action. For doing any action, condition cant be changed , habit can only be change forcefully, but one can make right choice in perspective of everyone so that there will be no need of regretting for our own action.well, in the end I want to say that I was thinking to write a blog from long time which is turned into\'action\', because I was dying to ... ;) another factor of edmitting an action ;)
No matter what you think of Twitter, you can\'t ignore the stats and the adoption rates and all those unique view statistics that you can find on Mashable. It\'s a growing phenomenon that is moving so fast that it can give you whiplash. Yes, Twitter is now up to about 14 million Unique views in the month of March. Anything with this much momentum and views is a gold-mine. So what\'s up with Twitter for me? I have been able to come across the most diverse and unique data when using search.twitter.com. This is a very different search engine when compared to google search. It\'s a way to scrape for keywords in the twittersphere, a sampling of what people are talking about at the moment vs. data mining tons of html that is quickly becoming out of date. If I\'m attending GDC, I\'m not going to search google for\'GDC \'09\'and expect to find out what is going on right now. Immediately I reach for search.twitter.com. or to shipping Dead Space we provided a bunch of\'pre-released\'copies of the game to certain people in the industry. I started searching twitter for\'dead space\'and utilizing the results. I would get things like\'@jimmygameplayer I\'ve just started playing Dead Space and will hope to have a review soon.
5. TRAFFIC is critical. Due to the earlier point, scale becomes much more important - if you are an advertiser, wouldn\'t you rather go to the vendor that has aggregated a lot more content and traffic than a relatively smallish site (unless of course it is a niche site and you are in that market)? Therefore, we see the emergence all sorts of sites and services such as technorati, digg, etc. that do not product produce any substantial content on their own, but serve to index and aggregate the other content on the web to drive traffic to their sites. Seen in this context, the Microsoft Yahoo merger makes a lot of sense. Together, Microsoft and Yahoo! accounted for 15.6% of all U.S. Internet visits for the week ending Jan. 26. In the same period, Google\'s share was 7.7%.  6. Relevance drives Traffic. Web search engines are the ultimate example of this fact. Often, the most advertising dollars go to those services that can accurately and comprehensively aggregate and serve out relevant resources to consumers. Relevance drives traffic, relevant traffic drives advertising, advertising drives revenue. Revenue drives profits. Profits mean that you can kick back and sip pina coladas without having to work 80 hour weeks and read blogs like this one!!
Auto Mafia - A report from the Indian Express.  Ever wondered as to why the Dilli autowallah\'s overcharge so much? I happen to stumble on this article in the Indian Express which explores the existence of auto-mafia in Delhi. Its an eye-opener.  THE Centre\'s Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (EPCA) wants the Supreme Court to lift its 12-year-old freeze on granting fresh permits to auto-rickshaws. The EPCA believes this ban has `pushed\' the public transport system into the hands of the financier mafia.  On September 16, 1997, the Supreme Court had ordered that only 55,000 autos could run on Delhi\'s roads. A new vehicle could only be introduced as a replacement. In such cases, the permit passes on from the old to the new.  Since permits are so much in demand, original permit holders have begun to sell them to financiers and mi,\'lemen.These men,who have formed a cartel and dominate the auto market,sell the vehicle and the accompanying permit for a premium. While the showroom price of an auto is Rs 1.25 lakh, the financiers charge Rs 4.5 lakh.  The vicious cycle continues.  The owner rents out the auto at a high price to the driver, who then ends up overcharging customers. The EPCA -set up in 1998 by the Ministry of Environment and Forests to monitor pollution levels -made its observations on the auto scenario in its 34th report, presented on Friday before the apex court\'s Special Bench of three judges, headed by Chief Justice of India K G Balakrishnan. The EPCA stated:\'Removal of the cap will help eliminate the dominating hold of the `financier mafia\' who are exploiting not only the auto drivers but also the general public by pushing up artificially the capital cost of three wheelers, and hence the operational cost.\'If more autos are allowed to ply, an owner can bypass financiers and directly approach the government for a permit.\'The financiers buy the TSRs (autos) and farm them out. There is no information as to the owner or the driver,\'senior advocate and amicus curiae Harish Salve, who presented the report before the court, said on Friday.  The committee\'s findings were arrived at after a series of consultations with the Delhi government\'s Transport department, the Delhi Police, associations and manufacturers of three-wheelers, the Delhi government\'s Weights and Measures department, the Delhi Finance Corporation and the representatives of private financiers and the Automobile Research Association of India (ARAI).  The EPCA explained how the mafia-controlled TSR transport mechanism has led to an increase in pollution levels too.\'A bulk of the vehicles (TSRs)onroad are owned by a limited number of people who rent these to drivers on a charge of around Rs 250 to Rs 300for a night-hourshift.The driver pays for the CNG fuel and minor repairs, which a,\'s to the tendency to cut costs,\'the committee said.  The EPCA report also mentions how growing traffic congestion eats into the daily bread of drivers, who are forced to lose their chance to drive the vehicle the next day if they do not earn a substantial daily amount.  The EPCA has also said that the `smart card\' system -- a smart card would have replaced the permit and carried detailed information on the owner and driver of an auto - has failed to takeoff.Repeated ads and public announcements elicit no response, the EPCA states.\'In spite of all the efforts of the Transport department to improve the registration database,the system is in bad shape.The a,\'resses of(both owners and drivers)are not clear;ownership information is difficult to transcribe.It is alleged the ownership is concentrated in the hands of the financier mafia,\'the committee said.  The EPCA recommended the cap on autos be removed so that the government can develop TSRs as\'intermediate public transport vehicles\'meant to provide\'last-mile connectivity\'to commuters in the city.  love,  Si,\'harth  PS. If you have a link on any interesting article, let me know. Will be glad to post it on the blog.
GOD should have been an Engineer!! -   The World and The Software Developmnet Life Cycle!!  God made this world in 5 days.... Ever wondered how??   If God was able to make us and everything else in 5 days, why do software engineers have to devote so much time in developing a simple system which is infinitesimally small compared to this planet?\'GOD , for one , did not have any installed base to worry about upward integration and compatibility . No platform dependency.....  and I\'m guessing he skipped most part of documentation also.....\'No wonder He ended up with such a mess.  Maybe if GOD had followed SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle), maybe the earth woul have been a better place to live in.  P.S : I\'m also sure that GOD used some Open Source Technology under the EULA Liscencing and the copyleft standards which explains so many versions of the same species all around us!! ;-)  Well, GOD should have taken Computer Science Engineering. And if he did take it... he should have paid attention in class.  So.... Now gotta get back to work... have to complete the documentation for my project... bye!!!
Pretend to be a Time Traveler Day: this Weekend! Thursday, September 10th, 2009 Howdy folks, I know it\'s a little late notice but PTTBATTD has moved to September 12, though I think we\'ll still have a December iteration as in previous years.  If you live in Portland, OR, though, you\'re in for a treat! I\'ve teamed up with Drunken Rampage and they\'ve organized a fantastic even this Saturday where we time travelers will be dominating a good section of Northwest.  Everyone\'s invited to participate; we\'ve got some great challenges and events lined up, as well as a good few bars to hide out in after the normals are spooked.  Also, there will be several time traveler tour groups, one of which will be led by yours truly.  If this sound interesting, check out the site for more details.  Even if you\'re not in Portland, you are encouraged to pretend to be a time traveler wherever you might confuse people.  For new folks, here are the classical rules:  Pretend to be a Time Traveler Day  You must spend the entire day in costume and character. The only rule is that you cannot actually tell anyone that you are a time traveler. Other than that, anything\'s game.  There are three possible options:  1) Utopian/cliché Future - \'If the Future did a documentary of the last fifty years, this is how badly the reenactors would dress.\' Think Star Trek: TNG or the Time Travelers from Hob. Ever see how the society in Futurama sees the 20th century? Run with it. Your job is to dress with moderately anachronistic clothing and speak in slang from varying decades. Here are some good starters:  - Greet people by referring to things that don\'t yet exist or haven\'t existed for a long time. Example: \'Have you penetrated the atmosphere lately?\' \'What spectrum will today\'s broadcast be in?\' and \'Your king must be a kindly soul!\'  - Show extreme ignorance in operating regular technology. Pay phones should be a complete mystery (try placing the receiver in o,\' places). Chuckle knowingly at cell phones.  2) Dystopian Future - This one offers a little more flexibility. It can be any kind of future from Terminator to Freejack. The important thing to remember is dress like a crazy person with armor. Black spray painted football pads, high tech visors, torn up trenchcoats and maybe even some dirt here or there. Remember, dystopian future travelers are very startled that they\'ve gone back in time. Some starters:  - If you go the \'prisoner who\'s escaped the future\' try shaving your head and putting a barcode on the back of your neck. Then stagger around and stare at the sky, as if you\'ve never seen it before.  - Walk up to random people and say \'WHAT YEAR IS THIS?\' and when they tell you, get quiet and then say \'Then there\'s still time!\' and run off.  - Stand in front of a statue (any statue, really), fall to your knees, and yell \'NOOOOOOOOO\'  - Stare at newspaper headlines and look astonished.  - Take some trinket with you (it can be anything really), hand it to some stranger, along with a phone number and say \'In thirty years dial this number. You\'ll know what to do after that.\' Then slip away.  2) The Past - This one is more for beginners. Basically dress in period clothing (preferably Victorian era) and stagger around amazed at everything. Since the culture\'s set in place already, you have more of a template to work off of. Some pointers:  - Airplanes are terrifying. Also, carry on conversations with televisions for a while.  - Discover and become obsessed with one trivial aspect of technology, like automatic grocery doors. Stay there for hours playing with it.  - Be generally terrified of people who are dressed immodestly compared to your era. Tattoos and shorts on women are especially scary.
What to do! After meeting lots of people  in last few days i came to some conclusion. In this professional world that we all\'live\'in, the cut throat competition that we have been exposed to, has made our lives so miserable that it needs immediate attention. Moreover, the irony is, no one seems to be alarmed. With this viscious cycle continuing there is virtually no future! or atleast nothing that i can think of.  This mad mad race, winning at all cost,  is taking a hefty toll on one\'s own personal life as well. People are less happy with what they are getting and more sad for what other are getting!! I mean one should be concerned about him/her self more then the others.  Sad some of my few friends have also got this virus, i am trying hard to explain to them that please do not get into all this. Life is different and do not mess it up just by living it how others wanted you to. Don\'t live somebody else\'s life!  Sad...but true...many people have no idea what they will be doing tomorrow? Leave tomorrow they don\'t have idea about today!!
1. They appear different to different eyes:  Visit two homes, perhaps in the same street, in which there is similar trouble—sickness, or bereavement, or failure in business, or sore poverty. In one, all is gloom, repining, comfortless perplexity. In the other, there is light in the darkness, a rainbow on the storm.  To one sufferer God\'s ways are hard, dark, mysterious; he is even ready to think them unjust. The other says, \'I could not bear it in my own strength, but the Lord stands by me and strengthens me. God\'s will must be right. He cannot make mistakes or be unfaithful. He is my Refuge and Strength.\' So with God\'s government of the world and general providence. One mind fastens on the pain, sorrow, calamity, which every hour records—pestilence, earthquake, tempest, and so forth. Another sees that the universal design and general working of all natural laws is for good and happiness, not evil; that the main part of human suffering has its root in sin; that \'the earth is full of the goodness of the Lord;\' and trusts God for the rest.  2. God\'s dealings not only appear different; they are and must be different, according to the temper and attitude of our souls. To the soul that bows under God\'s hand, trusts his Word, clings closer to him in trial, it is \'chastening\'—full of mercy, rich in result (Heb. 12:6, etc.). The proud, stubborn heart, that resents and rebels against affliction, is hardened by it, like Pharaoh.
When I was in Barcelona with SIME on May 21, I had the chance to meet a veteran, well acclaimed journalist, Jennifer L. Schenker who is one of the industry\'s most respected commentators with over 30 years working for leading publications like TIME Magazine, the International Herald Tribune and Red Herring. Since less than a year she runs her own venture, Informillo.com. And she claimed that bloggers are not journalists. She felt journalism is more about reporting facts and connecting information together without any personal bias, and blogging involves more of the personal factor, and is most of the times personal opinion more than information per se. Some how I felt that bloggers are journalists too since news events are first broken out in the blogs (and micro blogs now) too, and generally digg which could be a decent indicator of things that are on the top of the web mesh for the day predominantly features blogs along with news sites. And when you dig deeper, the word journalist encompasses both a columnist and a reporter. So probably blogging is all about being a columnist, but what happens if you include video bloggers? They interview people and spread information / news too. The intersection between traditional and new media is a grey area, and at least the pundits of the English language would not be a great fan of the cross pollination of the terms and usage.
The American tradition of tinkering -- the spark for inventions from the telephone to the Apple computer -- is making a comeback, boosted by renewed interest in hands-on work amid the economic crisis and falling prices of high-tech tools and materials.  The modern milling machine, able to shape metal with hairbreadth precision, revolutionized industry. Blake Sessions has one in his dorm room, tucked under the shelf with the peanut butter on it.  The Massachusetts Institute of Technology junior has been using the mill to make prototypes for a bicycle-sprocket business he\'s planning. He bolts down a piece of aluminum plate, steps to his desk and, from his computer, sets the machine in motion. Tinkering With Technology  Jason Euren, an anthropology student at the New School University in Manhattan, worked with a soldering kit at the Brooklyn hackerspace Resistor recently.\'It\'s kind of a ridiculous thing to have,\'says Mr. Sessions, 20 years old. But\'in today\'s marketplace you can\'t only offer a technical aptitude. You have to be able to provide something more.\'Occupying a space somewhere between shop class and the computer lab, the new tinkerers are making everything from devices that Twitter how much beer is left in a keg to robots that assist doctors. The experimentation is even creating companies. With innovation a prime factor in driving economic growth, and corporate research and development spending tepid, the marriage of brains and brawn offers one hopeful glimmer.
Another marriage ruined by the gays  Clearly gays getting married in other states has ruined Charlie\'s marriage to the point that he is not even interested in spending his anniversary with his wife. This is why marriage equality must be stopped.  The Broward Palm Beach News has been checking in on political lovebirds Charlie Crist and Carole Rome:  A Crist-Miss Story: Florida\'s First Couple Celebrates First Anniversary... Separately: Crist still followed through with the marriage, of course, but in the year since, the pair have rarely been seen together. Most recently, Crist spent the evening of their first anniversary in Palm Beach\'s Mar-a-Lago at a March of Dimes fundraiser, with wife Carole nowhere in sight, according to page2live.com.  This after a year in which Rome bounced between visits to her kids in New York and her home on Fisher Island, while Crist stayed in Tallahassee or his home in Tampa Bay. Remember, Crist worked right through the couple\'s honeymoon.  But come on! The first anniversary? You two aren\'t even trying anymore. And why should you? If Crist is gay -- or if he\'s just a commitment-phobic straight guy who likens Burger King funnel cake sticks to a \'beignet\' -- he shouldn\'t feel political pressure to get married.

I was there. From Outweek, December 24, 1989:  Click image to enlarge.  By: Michael Rogers | permanent link |    Comments (17) Friday, December 11, 2009  The Women  Whether it\'s Suzanne Craig, Silda Spitzer or Darlene Ensign, it surprises me that the women married to these men stand behind them. I am no expert in heterosexual marriage, but I imagine the pain finding out your husband likes to have sex in bathroom stalls with men in train stations and airports ranks up there with experiencing divorce.  As the late Rodger McFarlane said says in Outrage:\'I know what they have to say in public and I actually kind of admire them for being able to give that performance, I\'m sure I couldn\'t. But, that\'s some wierd shit.\'Jenny Sanford wouldn\'t take the role.  South Carolina\'s first lady files for divorce - washingtonpost.com: The wife of embattled South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford (R) announced Friday morning she is filing for divorce, saying in a statement that she decided to dissolve her marriage after \'many unsuccessful efforts at reconciliation.
It\'s well into 2008 and another US election is around the corner, and therefore, like any other dutiful blog in the blogosphere, it is my duty to comment on it despite the fact that I neither have the knowledge nor the perspective to comment. And therefore, that makes me perfectly qualified to author the \'Dummies\' guide to the US elections\'. American elections are important to the world because we never know where they are going to drop bombs next, and a close analysis of media chatter is necessary to figure out if one\'s country is in some sort of \'axis of evil\'. So let\'s get right down to the key issues at stake, shall we? All US elections are fundamentally about left vs right. The Democrats are Left (usually licking their wounds), and the Republicans are Right (in the thick of stealing elections). The Democrats believe that it\'s right that the rest of the world is best left alone. The Republicans believe that they have the right to invade what\'s left of the world. In the interest of brevity, for the rest of the post, the Democrats shall be referred to as Ds (as in Docile Donkeys), and the Republicans shall be referred to Rs (as in Rogue Elephants).  The Ds want to kill babies. The Rs prefer to kill women. Ds are anti-business and the Rs are anti-worker. Ds talk about securing jobs while outsourcing the manufacturing of \'Obama-Biden\' bumper stickers to China. Rs talk about securing America while outsourcing the torture of prisoners to other countries. Ds believe that gay marriages between man and animal are OK. Rs believe that not-so-gay marriages between priests and young boys are OK. Ds don\'t believe in family values. Rs believe strongly in family values such as the sanctity of marriage and abstention, as long as one is not a former prisoner of war or a 20-month old Alaskan governor. Ds are best described as a pluralized slang term for cats lacking patriotism while Rs are best described as people with scarlet shading in the neck area indulging in ugly jingoism.

Section 11A of Aircraft Act, 1934 - Hello everybody.By seeing the title u must be thinking that I am a law student but to tell u I am not a student of law and i am not telling you about the fundamentals of INDIAN constitution.I just wanted to tell you that there was a violation of\'Section 11A of Aircraft Act, 1934\'which states that the aircraft organisation have to abide by the rules given by BCAS (Bureau Of Civil Aviation Security) and in its guidelines BCAS has stated that vip\'s/\',ip\'s are exempted from security checks or frisking.  Well you must be thinking that am I a vip.ha ofcourse not.but our former president Mr.A.P.J. Abdul Kalam is a \',ip and he was frisked and even asked to remove his shoes at IGI antional airport in New Delhi by security personnels of Continental Airlines(An U.S. based airlines).It was the boss of the airlines who made it necessary to be checked.Although you must be thinking that everyday many laws are broken why this in particular?because Mr. kalam is a role model for many of us and especially the student community.He represents INDIAN scientist community and frisking him is a fall of national pride .  Well it was a law which was broken in INDIA and it is not made internationally.There are greater offences than this one when we go in past .When George Fernandes was in ministry in NDA regime then he had to go security check in America when he was on an official visit there where as it is clearly stated that any minister from any country is exempted from security checks then why was it performed .It is not only one instance .Pranab mukherjee was coming back from France to India then also he has to go through security checks which is again unforgivable.I am great supporter for equality but then equality must not only be on papers it must be implemented.Checking our role models and people representing a country in name of the security is not permissible and even when it has been stated clearly.  Coming back to India a FIR has been registered against the employees concerned but i guess it will not do because they were only the people following orders the issue has to be taken to all the aircraft organisations and clear directives must be given to them and it must be cleared that if there is exemption then it must be applied for all and if there is not then everybody must be checked even a minister from any other country(but atithi devo bhava) .Security checks must be upgraded but not only for publicising it some concrete steps are to be followed other than just checking \',ip\'s.
The Sad Death Of The Queen Of The Skies   When Zagat first started their consumer-driven restaurant guide, I was one of their very first reviewers. I ate out a lot-- and in a lot of cities. A few years ago they started another guide, one for airlines. I fly a lot too, and they asked me to be one of the initial reviewers. There are 6,000 reviewers now and tihs past year I once again voted for British Air as my favorite overall airline. That\'s probably the last time they\'ll be getting a positive score from me. For decades I\'ve thought of them as the gold standard of high quality, professional service. I like Singapore and Virgin well enough and Cathay has been pretty good-- if headed in the wrong direction lately-- but all the airlines that are good, always seem to be imitating and trying to catch up with B.A. Those days are over.  B.A. is hurting. Financially they\'re a mess and abysmal management has driven the company into a hole they\'re not going to recover from witouth a complete managerial overhaul. Yesterday I flew from L.A. to Rome. Instead of it being the first fabulous part of a trip-- the way I\'ve always considered flying on B.A. flights-- it was a horror show from beginning to end.  Early in the day, the flight attendants union voted to strike on December 21 and come back on January 2. When I called for advice about what to do to prevent myself from being stranded abroad, I could have been talking with someone from Delta, American or United or any airline that puts its customer service department through a rigorous training procedure on how to frustrate and infuriate customers. I spent well over an hour on hold and talking with two customer service clerks and in the end, got nowhere. They said that I could cancel my tickets but since the airline hadn\'t\'officially\'cancelled my flight home-- and probably wouldn\'t until I got to the airport in January-- it would cost me $250 to cancel. And I was lucky because I had purchased a refundable ticket!  I decided to take the gamble-- while the company\'s disastrous boss, Willie Walsh, postured and acted the tough anti-union thug in public-- and I was immediately sorry when I got on board the flight. Only one of the 3 restrooms was functioning in the business class cabin-- and it was in a sorry state of cleanliness right from the beginning. The whole cabin was in a sho,\'y condition in fact, way below the B.A. standards that have always attracted me to the airline. It looks like one of the cost savings was those paper toilet seat covers. The crew was the dregs, the sound system wasn\'t functioning enough to understand a word anyone ever said. And, the food was as bad as you can expect from a third-rate flying garbage truck. Poor British Air!  And poor me! The flight was late getting in and although I made it-- with a second or two to spare-- onto my connecting flight from London, my checked luggage didn\'t. It still hasn\'t. They claim it arrived in Rome but they seem to have lost it again.\'Seem to,\'because communication is not a strong point. Last night I stayed in all night waiting for the promised bag; didn\'t even have dinner. But this morning-- still no idea where my bag is or when-- or even if-- I\'ll ever get it back.  As the Guardian put it today\'the way Willie Walsh has handled this dispute will end up in the MBA textbooks-- as how not to do it. Just over two years ago, the BA boss hailed a new era in its often-troubled industrial relations. Now the atmosphere between management and workforce has become more poisonous than ever. Both sides risk sleepwalking into a strike that neither really wants. They should be forced-- by government if necessary-- to negotiate with each other. Carelessness is no excuse for destroying a business.\'Too late for that; they need to rid themselves of Walsh and get back to the days when they understood what it meant to build customer loyalty instead of contempt.
Singularity Summit: a brief review Wednesday, October 7th, 2009 So this last weekend I was very privileged to be invited to attend the Singularity Summit in New York, an annual meeting of minds to discuss the implications of growing (and possible accelerating) technologies.  Now, despite having written a comic story about this very subject, I\'ve never actually been in to an official gathering of these folks before, and didn\'t really know what to expect.  Highlights:  - The audience was of a much higher caliber than what I expected.  Beforehand I had a lurking fear that Singularitarians were actually mostly navel-gazing sci-fi geeks who were more interested in a \'nerd rapture\' than the facts of emerging technologies.  In truth, it turns out that I was likely the dumbest guy in the room, with essentially all the attendees being very educated, thoughtful and (often) professionally successful individuals.  It was an interesting mix of industry leaders, scientists, economist and skeptics all possessing the necessary faculties for diverse and sober views concerning the subjects at hand.  Folks were friendly, too, and mingling in between talks I could always make my way into a group where interesting conversation was going on.  - The selection of speakers was very diverse.  I was concerned that the majority may involve a cheerleading squad for a particular view, but in fact topics and speakers ranged from those who believed in an inevitable \'hard takeoff\' Singularity to those who though *some* singularity was necessary to avoid existential risks to AI researchers who believed that belief in the Singularity is just a cognitive bias that futurists have.  Regardless of their views, though, every speaker treated the subject matter as a very serious and legitimate topic of discussion and investigation.  - Ray Kurzweil\'s talks were very good as one might expect, though I personally felt these were some of the less exciting parts of the summit.  I don\'t think it\'s any fault of Kurzweil\'s, though, since I\'m just really familiar with his work and arguments, and it seems like he\'s had to respond to the same tired arguments for several years now.  Two things that impressed me were the astonishing amount of evidence, detail and overall research he puts into his thesis (far more thorough than any other speakers) and second, the fact that he really looks a lot younger than a man in his 60s.  I know some folks take jabs at the astonishing amount of supplements and other dietary/medical steps he takes to increase his lifespan, but it really does seem to have an effect on his vitality and appearance.  He could easily be a good front man for the movement, though I noted that he wasn\'t presented as such, and a variety of other speakers seemed to be pushed to the forefront instead.  - Eliezer Yudkowsky, as always, was very clever and humorous in his examination of cognitive bias and how downright insane human beings are really wired to be.  With a series of statistics (with the audience participating in some questions), he showed how even a \'rational\' person\'s mind can be hacked primarily due to its messy \'spaghetti code\' evolutionary history.  Symptoms of cognitive bias include tending to believe more specific or dramatic threats over more realistic ones (examples included the Bush administration preparing for elaborate \'movie threats\' while ignoring statistically more likely and dangerous threats like hurricane disasters).  With relation to the Singularity, one popular fear is the \'Terminator Scenario\' where AI becomes violent, humanoid and bend on destroying the human race.  Despite having not even the slightest grounds in fact, this image is popular because it\'s specific and dramatic.  Likewise, in regards to futurism in general, we tend to overestimate the macroscopic (flying cars, jet packs, space travel) and underestimate the advances of the subtle (internet, cloud computing, augmented reality, specific and general AI).  Peter Thiel, co-founder of PayPal and venture capitalist, provided a very interesting perspective.  From the view of a technologist and businessman, he believes that the topic that needs to be discussed further is what happens if the Singularity doesn\'t happen or doesn\'t happen fast enough.  He seems to be of the opinion that if it doesn\'t develop quickly enough, there could be an incident similar to the ‘dot com crash\' (where investors overestimated tech growth) only on a much larger, more devastating scale.  He argued that the Singularity has the potential to be an extremely beneficial trend in the future, but there needs to be a more concentrated economic and industrial effort to ensure that it develops the right way and at the right pace.  Aubrey de Grey may have been my favorite speaker, as the topic of biological longevity research is an area where my education is sorely lacking.  Some magnificent leaps and bounds in this field have been made, and Dr. de Grey graphed life expectancy paths (using only the most pessimistic predictions regarding advancements) amongst different age groups today.  It was a very thorough talk and, while seemingly optimistic, it involved some of the hardest, tangible science out there.  I feel this is one angle of Transhumanism that should get more face time in the public eye.  While AI is the more significant thing to watch in the long run (and the most terrifying), aging and longevity research is a very tangible, understandable science with a growing and continuous set of real-world applications that even the harshest cynic couldn\'t call useless.  On top of that, Dr. de Gray really does come off as a very charming, thoughtful person who is genuinely interested in helping everyone he can (at the expense of perhaps his own longevity).  -Another interesting observation is that half the freaking people at the summit read Dresden Codak. Why on Earth would such important individuals waste their time on this comic is beyond me, but it was kind of neat.  Even though I was just an attendee, I\'ve never gotten this much attention even at a comic show (on the second day I was even roped into giving autographs in the lobby!).  A definite highlight was when Aubrey de Grey pulled me aside to praise my satirical essay featuring Trans-Simianism. Who knew?  Conclusion: a wonderful group of intellectuals discussing a relevant and fascinating array of subjects, from autonomous cars to brain scans to curing blindness to avoiding being destroyed by a superintelligence.  Both the speakers and attendees are the type of people I wouldn\'t mind seeing again at next year\'s summit.  If you\'re interested in the subject at all (from skeptic to optimist) and can afford the price of admission, it\'s definitely an event worth seeing for yourself.  -AD
Holding Back the Rise of the Machines? February 20th, 2010 by Daniel Tunkelang Respond  Amazon\'s Mechanical Turk is one of my favorite examples of leveraging the internet for innovation:  Amazon Mechanical Turk is a marketplace for work that requires human intelligence. The Mechanical Turk web service enables companies to programmatically access this marketplace and a diverse, on-demand workforce. Developers can leverage this service to build human intelligence directly into their applications.  But, in my view, Mechanical Turk does not take its vision far enough. In the conditions of use, Amazon makes it clear that only human participation need apply: \'you will not use robots, scripts or other automated methods to complete the Services\'.  On one hand, I can understand that Amazon\'s vision for Mechanical Turk, like Luis Von Ahn\'s \'games with a purpose\', explicitly aims to apply human intelligence to tasks where automated methods seem inadequate. On the other hand, what are automated methods but encapsulations of human methods? It seems o,\' for Amazon to be so particular about the human / machine distinction, especially given that terms of service impose practically no other constraints on execution (beyond the obvious legal ones), Moreover, Mechanical Turk offers developers a variety of ways to assure quality (redundancy, qualification tests, etc.).  Granted, there are some important concerns that would have to be a,\'ressed if Amazon were to relax the \'humans-only\' constraint. For example, a developer today can reasonably assume that two different human \'Providers\' execute tasks independently. With automated participation, there\'s a far greater risk of dependence e.g., from multiple programmers applying the same algorithms. This possibility would have to be taken into account in quality assurance.  Still, the benefits of allowing automated participants would seem to far outweigh the risks. At pennies a task, Mechanical Turk has a limited appeal to the human labor force indeed, research by Panos Ipeirotis suggests that Amazon\'s revenue from the service may be so law that it doesn\'t even cover the costs of a single dedicated developer!  In contrast, there\'s evidence that programmers would take an interest in participation, were it an option. Marketplaces like TopCoder and competitions like the Netflix Prize suggest that computer scientists take an interest in proving their mettle in many of the kinds of tasks for which organizations already use Mechanical Turk.  So, why not give algorithms a chance? Surely we\'re not that afraid of Skynet or the \'technological singularity\'. Let\'s give machines and their programmers a chance to show off the best of both worlds!
Miss D loves her Dumbo soft toy, It pretty much goes everywhere with us. If she\'s tired or grumpy then she needs that elephant and bedtimes are a non-starter if he\'s not around  I know she\'ll grow out of this phase so it doesn\'t bother me, but my only stipulation is that Dumbo MUST have a wash on a regular basis to keep him vaguely fresh and clean. This requirement stems from a story my wife told me a while back. One of her cousins had the original \'Linus from Snoopy\' style security blanket, he could never be parted from it and would never allow it to be washed. You can imagine how gruesome this piece of fabric was; I\'m sure if it were left alone long enough in a controlled environment, a whole new lifeform would have evolved from the fibres of this dribbly, snot-ri,\'led abomination. So, with that image permanently engraved on my brain, every couple of weeks it\'s bathtime for Dumbo and Miss D\'s postpartum tantrums begin. It\'s strange, she can leave him on the sofa and forget about him all afternoon while we\'re doing something else but as soon as I pick him up she wants her elephant back.
Being Back...!!! So I am back...  Though I dont know why !!! After having deleted my approx. 15 posts I thought I did a mistake. For the few posts were really good enough not to be created again.  Yes few people belong to the catagory :Think & Think before committing.These people do nothing much in life.Another class consists of people like me who do things in an emotional rage and repent for long if not entire life time as to why did they commit the\'unwanted\'act.I am still not sure as to which class is more blemish.Well let us not dwell into that.  Time has come to look things positively.I could easily end up my entire life in cigerrate smokes.But that is not the reason I am here for.\'Cigerrate can ruin you\', have already been proved by few fanatics.  At the end of my life I may end up with a healthy bank balance, few friends ,and few relationships that do not exist as of now.So whats the big deal...???There are lacs of men who end up like that.....Got to make a difference in my life... Spendind time in thinking over myself and my relationship with the things around me....  Got to write about this\'exile\'at TI-Banglore.There is no\'Bang\'and no\'Glore\'here.I long to return back to my friends!! This time I wont let the blogging habit dominate me!!  Distance make people grow fonder OR out of sight out of mind.Well differnt people have just vomited what they felt about various occasins in life....Never believe or follow any such stuff strictly.Use your own natural possessions!!!
WHY I LIKE HIM- Dr. Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam or better known as APJ Abdul Kalam is known for his versatility.He has contributed a lot to India\'s development both as a president and as a scientist.He is a person who encourages youth,as he firmly believes that youth is the backbone of India.He is known for his quotes.\'Thinking is progress. Non-thinking is stagnation of the individual organisation and the country. Thinking leads to action. Knowledge without action is useless and irrelevant. Knowledge with action, converts adversity into prosperity.\'is one fine example. WHY I LIKE HIM- Shivaji Rao Gaekwad or better known as Rajinikanth is known for his hardwork and perseverance.Can you ever imagine a bus conductor turning into a celebrity who is known worldwide,and who has millions and millions practically chanting his name?Aint it far beyond our imagination..??Well yes, had Rajinikanth not been in this world.He is a person who is very well known for his hardwork and sets his life as an example for the same.He tells us clearly that\'Appearance is not the only criteria one need to possess in oder to attract people\'.No wonder he is known across the globe.
Session with Bawa-n-Dinesh in Delhi on 21Jan\'09  I am sure it must have happened sometime in your life, you are walking on the street, just passing a cake shop, and you slow down wondering whether you should give in to the temptation and indulge, you have almost decided not to, and a gentle breeze parcels a whiff of sweet aromatic air right into your nose! You almost taste the black forest with cherries or a wlanut almond or a pineapple watermelon with roasted cashew  toppings....yuummmmm....Now you are left with no choice. In the next couple of minutes you are walking out of the shop licking the melting chocolate off your fingers :-)  Bawa and Dinesh visited Delhi for a couple of days and all of the above happened, metaphorically and actually too! And their session on the 21st evening was like that - a gentle whiff packed with a lot of goodies.  Knowledge Bawa said Guruji explained dispassion beautifully. He said, a desire to have any pleasurable experience springs up when you see or hear something about it. This desire or craving is called \'Trishna\'. For e.g. till you have not heard about Bali, you had no desire to visit Bali.  Not giving in to the Trishna is \'Vairagya\' (dispassion).  As we grow up our desires get mature and refined.  Q/A: 1. My dad has threatened me that if I go for the upcoming YES!+ in Simla, then I will have to leave him and my house for ever. I have already paid and registered. What should I do?  Bawa: Wow, thats great! Just say good bye and go to Simla. (laughter in the audience) If your dad really doesnt take you back home, then go to the ashram and do seva :-). Tell him when you feel like calling me back, just call me, ok, byeeee, Jai Guurdev ;-). Dont ask for permission from your dad, just tell him I am going and ask for blessings. Tell him that he has given you such good upbringing, which has made you capable of making the right decisions. Tell him there is nothing more I can ask from you dad, as you have already given me everything. The only thing you can give me now is blessings... (applause). 2. My mom becomes emotional and throws tantrums and blackmails me saying she will not talk to me if I do seva and do AOL activities.  Bawa: Never give in to the emotional blackmail of parents. Know that they love you intensely so they behave like that. Most of them do not have experience of hard core seva, so they do not understand the significance and depth of what you are doing.  Bau said you are so lucky you have parents who protest, who take so much interest in your life, who are bothered about you, who care to bother about you. Not every parent does that.  So when your parents crib, just feel grateful.  I forgot a few things, there were lot of rip-roaring laughter moments.   Bau made it sound so light and yet so profound when he said that may be Guruji has asked Delhi YES!+ to do the 1 lac people March on 28th Feb against terrorism and corruption (www.themarch.in) just to keep the volunteers busy or maybe it could lead to a very powerful transformation of our country.  And then Bau shared some funny and touchy Guru stories. I am not going tom take the effort to type all that. You missed it.  Love, Jai Gurudev Saleel
Feel Good .!!! :) Recently i have seen a video which says abt the secret of life.... tat video has inspired me a lot.. This is wat all of the video is about...

Spend some time in finding wat you want in life.... we have been always spending time thinking abt wat we dont want in life... i dont want less marks in my exams i dont want to lose my job... we dont want wars to happen... we hate terrorism... by this way we all are encouraging the world with t the thoughts we have....\'ALL THAT WE ARE IS THE RESULT OF WHAT WE HAVE THOUGHT\'SO OUR THOUGHTS DEFINE OUR WORLD
Achieving Quality Living -  If we look around in history also in life around us, there are people who have created history or who are creating history. These are handful of people which you count on fingers while other part of population seems mere existing on the this planet rather than living the life. Just look closely any inspiring figure whether a social workers, reformers, spiritual leaders or Business Tycoons you can take any name say it Martin Luther king or Mother Teresa, or Sri Sri Ravi Shankar or Swami Vivekananda, Bill Gates, Henry Ford All these people have same number of minutes in a day as we have. Then why these people able to deliver much more than we do? What make them different from other people. Now this is a wider issue. I am catching one thread of discussion in this post.   If you realize in life we do kind of actions one which are life supporting and other are life degrading. Life supporting actions help us to move forward life life degrading actions bind our legs and put us back. And not doing those things which we supposed to do doesn\'t hurt us how much we suffer from doing the things which we don\'t supposed to do. Wrong actions come with consequences which takes a huge amount of time and energy to clear it up and come to the ground zero again. Whether these are wrong habits, wrong patterns or wrong decisions.  Sri Sri rightly says,\'people spend half of the health to gain the wealth and then spend half of the wealth to gain back health.\'Not a wise things to do. Same is the case with most of refreshment and entertainment means in society like alcohol, smoking or explicit sex, too much of movies or drugs; all of them come with huge toll on the nervous system. Momentary excitement of senses doesn\'t give a bliss, yet once mind is trapped in the habit to enjoy these excitements; not doing these things causes huge pain: that\'s the bondage where most of population has stuck and then there is huge fight to come back to our ground zero state. Similar is the case when we ruin our relationship with somebody and then it become a hassle to recover it. Everybody want good relations with all yet some where we screw it up and then it take so much of efforts to put it back on track and sometime even life time doesn\'t suffice to recover few issues. So watch carefully next time you choose your words or actions or decision and remember a fact not doing those things which we supposed to do doesn\'t hurt us how much we suffer from doing the things which we don\'t supposed to do.  Slowly when we drop the things which we don\'t supposed to do, life become much more peaceful and expression of success all around.  All Glory to Gurudev Dinesh
I am writing this sitting in the Accident & Emergency department of the hospital for the second time in a month, and probably the 6th time in two years. This time its Mate\'s turn. He of nimble feet was running in the living room (my five year old has gone all mi,\'le class on us and has banned the description front room), when he tripped over some fresh air and cracked his head on the open patio door. He only cried for a minute, there wasn\'t even that much blood to be honest. If it had been me I would have filled the cut with ground pepper and put some sellotape on it. Unfortunately this is a method the Wife disapproves of so it was off to the hospital.  Knowing she would freak out, I decided to ring the wife whilst driving there and get it over and done with. She hates speaking to me when I\'m driving and using the hands free and always keeps the conversations short, so I obviously use this tactic a lot. Such was her maternal panic that not even this was working, so I had to resort to beeping and shouting\'Get out the way\'to imaginary road users. That did the trick.
life is a sinking boat. Friday, 19 February 2010 that nothing one does is right. gunning into a fight, one is a bull headed fool. avoid a fight, one is a coward. once sides have been picked, enemies are marked. if third parties start jumping in and giving biased opinions, there is no more room for mercy. but was it better to sidestep an argument that could will only get everyone\'s blood boiling; or was it better to fight fire with fire?   i have never claimed that i am a good person. i\'ve always warned anyone, everyone that i am a bad person - which is the truth, black as charcoal, dark as the shadow of the dark side of the moon; you are disappointed because of the illusion because you believe there is a redeemable quality in this shell called me, but for every good, the taint of saidin reeks corruption to my weaves.   call me childish, a fool, coward; but once you pick a side, then you are my enemy. it makes complete sense, the world is simple; it becomes black and white. i am a simple minded fool. spots of grey should be cast to dark corners like refuse never to see light, and to be given to natural death.

Why I am not ME..!! (n U r NOT urSELF) ......one of my friends asked me yesterday, if i have ever noticed that people try to make everyone around them like themselves...  ......well,yeah. I have. I haven\'t noticed this.. but i have observed that it is in nature of everyone to make others like themselves.Everyone naturally behaves in a manner which attracts others to their way of thinking.  ......but there is a little complication because people show different level of stubbornness in holding on to their own thoughts.Ultimately not everyone can turn everyone around them like themselves.There are surely going to be few losers and few winners in this battle of wits.Here we are going to talk about the ones who get influenced rather than influencing.  Some people are very easily influenced by others.It is very easy to convince them for anything.Such people either badly lack in self confidence or they do not think at all and derive any conclusion themselves.The latter is a very don\'t care sort of attitude which results from the over protectiveness received by the person in their former life.This makes them devoid of self dependence though they have enough confidence and capabilities.The former kind wants to establish his own way of thinking and conclusion,but he so easily gets captivated by others confidence that he never dares to challenge it.He readily agrees to things in very short time and ignores his original thoughts.. stepping down one more step from his intellectuality.  ......comparing both these natures, we feel that they are really too contrasting, and yes, they are. Where one has a highly centered and self destructive attitude who don\'t cares about anything at all in life, other one don\'t even understands the term attitude and value of self.He cares too much about everyone and everything happening around him... Where one is always happy and cool even in situation of serious consideration, other is hardly happy in life and is always worried in every situation.  .....Now, here is a point.How come these two entirely opposite natures of human life suffer from same problem? okay.. so here i have the answer for you which is as universal as sun and moon... earth and water... clouds n air..\'Nature is dual faced and the extremes often get mixed up.. At the end of journey.. u ll find yourself standing at the same place u started.So this is what u get after changing yourself too much.Same again...\'I positively hope that u ll be able to gulp that little amount of philosophy.Anyway coming to our point a little more directly this time,we often find people or things with very opposite nature in same pit. Most probably,this is because both of them are wrong.We know well that both, a little too less or a little too much are dangerous.One should always try to avoid the extremes.  Well.. if you are still looking for a common reason,there is one,indeed.All the people who have this tendency of becoming like others and follow someone, severely lack in\'self belief\'. Self belief is again a very simple thing of complicated nature.But it is the most important element in anybodies character which defines the whole face of his life.   P.S.\'hope you are not confused between self confidence and self belief. They are different... allot.  bottom line : realise the importance of SELF BELIEF in life... dont get carried away by others thoughts and beliefs...
Dalai Lama and Sri Sri say the same thing  I was reading Art of Living famous Sri Sri\'s articles and then once I read this story of Dalai Lama. Both said exactly the same thing about forgiving...  How divine... spend a couple of minutes to think about it..  Excerpt from book : The wisdom of forgiveness (Page 47)  When I first met the Dalai Lama some three decades ago, he told me that he had for given the Chinese for what they have done to the Tibetans.At the time, I had been surprised. Now I wanted to learn more in the upcoming interview. As the Dalai Lama came into the audience hall and sat down across from me, I asked him without any preamble,\'Your Holiness, I thought it natural that you\'d harbor resentment toward the Chinese. Yet you\'ve told me that this is not so. But do you, sometimes at least, experience deep feelings of animosity?\'That almost never,\'the Dalai Lama replied.\'I analyze like this: if I develop bad feelings toward those who make me suffer, this will only destroy my own peace of mind. But if I forgive, my mind becomes calm. Now, concerning our struggle for freedom, if we do it without anger, without hatred,but with true forgiveness, we can carry that struggle even more effectively. Struggle with calm mind, with compassion.Through analytical meditation, I now have full conviction that destructive emotions like hatred is no use. Nowadays,anger, hatred, they don\'t come. But little irritation some-times come.
Another reason is that there are 2 seniors who have helped us a lot once we got down at Raleigh-Arun and Srinath. They treated us almost like brothers and more than just some fellow Indian. In this time of the world where at times even friends think twice about helping friends, we were really amazed at the way those 2 guys helped us out and are still helping us out. Both of them advise us so much, help us out. Arun is one amazing guy though. He takes not only us but any fresher out for shopping for groceries or clothes or laptops. He lives near my house and it is his open invitation that anyone can come into his house at any time. Most of the time, excepting after 11 pm, there are atleast 6 to 10 guys in his house, either playing the PS2 or accessing his net or just sit there for chatting with the others. More than that he is such a lively person that most of the time he is cracking jokes and making other people laugh. We realized that there is no method from our side to pay them back for all their kindness they have done for us.
I have been working in a corporate office for 2.5 years now and have made many real friends. But this is not I am about tell you now. I am going to tell about a set of pseudo bu,\'ies you make because you cannot control your body\'s metabolism. Yes! Restroom bu,\'ies! You still may think it is some people you befriend in the restroom. No! these are pseudo! Over the past 2.5, I have seen a pattern, the same set of people seem to be present in the restroom when I enter the restroom, regardless of what time I enter, be it morning, noon, afternoon, 3 PM 4 PM whatever o,\' time, they are there! And even on the same day, they are there everytime you go! Then you realise, that these are the people whose bodies may probably function similar to yours, may be they have the same rate of metabolism, may be they have the same bodily cycles. It makes me get a friendly feeling towards them. After all, who does not like similar people!? Something like a stockholm syndorme. But the friendly feeling is not because you see them everyday, it is because deep down you know that you may be physically similar people.
I changed my watch. I wore a pair of shoes that had been ignored for long. I attended to my car repair personally. While driving to Jalsa I reprimanded a traffic offender. I sang along with the FM radio jock as one of my favorites belted itself out from the speakers on the car. I checked the electricals in the house that were giving us a problem. I unpacked and laid out the various gifts presented to me from the Oman Excellencies. I fixed my computer, discovering during the course that I had been using the wrong cable box for my internet connection. I made calls to people that I had been avoiding for sometime. And I watched the IPL with great delight. And I discovered that this was all due to the fact that I pushed myself to a work- out in the morning, despite the vagaries of the  previous night. I am content and painless - both in body and mind now. And I believe that this has come about by the simple fact of putting my body back into routine. When you miss the routine, the essentials of everyday, the spasms of life shall forever bother you and become a hindrance. I had subjected my body to much malaise and lethargy. Lethargy brings about defeat. It nurtures weakness in our confidence and the urge to move forward.
Three weeks after the mother on ABC\'s Brothers and Sisters (\'Nora Walker\' played by Sally Field) fretted over the GOP \'denying global warming,\' the ABC drama on Sunday night featured an episode centered around her daughter, \'Kitty Walker-McCallister,\' a Republican candidate for Senate in California played by Calista Flockhart, coming under attack from conservative rubes who think she used her influence to get the visa renewed for her older sister\'s French boyfriend, \'Luc.\'  At a campaign event with mini-video camera-toting bloggers visible, protesters boo and repeatedly chant: \'America for Americans!\' as they hold up signs, such as \'FRENCHIE GO HOME!!!\' and, with a mustache a,\'ed to Kitty\'s face, \'Hi Kitler!\' Just like the real media\'s slander of Tea Party protesters.  Kitty\'s husband whom she is running to succeed, incumbent \'Senator Robert McCallister,\' played by Rob Lowe, charges: \'It\'s just the conservative purity police trying to purge the party of lily-livered Republican moderates.\' Kitty complains to her sister, \'Sarah Walker,\' played by Rachel Griffiths: \'I am fighting for my political life with a bunch of ultra-conservative yahoos who want my head because you decided to fall in love with a guy who has immigration issues.\'  Audio: 90-second MP3 clip that matches the video highlights from the March 14 episode.

Earlier this morning during a keynote at SXSW, Twitter CEO and co-founder Evan Williams announced the availability of Twitter\'s @Anywhere platform. It is an identity system and is widely viewed as an answer to Facebook Connect. It allows Twitter subscribers to use their Twitter credentials to login to third-party services. The announcement was short on details and left me scratching my head.  Over Twitter, I asked Evan Williams if he would offer more details. He tweeted back and said that the \'details will come (specifically at Chirp).\' Chirp is Twitter\'s official developer conference slotted for April 14-15 and will be held in San Francisco. It could be a big week for Twitter. AllThingsD speculates that the company might also announce its plans for an ad-platform at the AdAge conference scheduled for April 12-13 in New York. There is clearly a lot of interest in San Francisco-based social messaging company which is valued at around a billion dollars and is viewed as a potential competitor to Facebook.  On Twitter Blog co-founder Biz Stone wrote:      We\'ve developed a new set of frameworks for a,\'ing this Twitter experience anywhere on the web.  When we\'re ready to launch, initial participating sites will include Amazon, AdAge, Bing, Citysearch, Digg, eBay, The Huffington Post, Meebo, MSNBC.com, The New York Times, Salesforce.com, Yahoo!, and YouTube. Imagine being able to follow a New York Times journalist directly from her byline, tweet about a video without leaving YouTube, and discover new Twitter accounts while visiting the Yahoo! home page—and that\'s just the beginning. Twitter has proven to be compelling in a variety of ways. With @anywhere, web site owners and operators will be able to offer visitors more value with less heavy lifting.
NBC\'s\'Law & Order\'programs are long-established and all over the schedule. But the sex-obsessed vice cops of\'Law & Order: Special Victims Unit\'are a breed apart. They exist to be socially provocative, which is to say, to rattle, to disturb. Viewers at home probably weren\'t ready for the plot that aired on NBC on March 3. These script writers are so revolting that they become almost comical.  As you read what follows, you decided how closely this mirrors anything resembling the world of reality.  Someone was strangling prostitutes to death and leaving prayer cards behind. The first suspect was a perverted man whose wife proclaimed he had converted to Christianity and overcome his sinful ways. The cops quickly discovered the man dismissed his wife as a\'prude\'and he was cheating on her with a variety of young girls, because\'it\'s not a crime to want a little variety\'in his sex life, including\'toys, role play, and threesomes.\'Despite his ardor for sexual gunplay as well, this so-called Christian was not the strangler.

Ornette Coleman is sitting at a table in the mi,\'le of his spacious loft, a fourth-floor aerie above the garment district bustle on West 36th Street in Midtown Manhattan.  It is a happy moment for a reporter: You hear on the radio that Mr. Coleman, the alto saxophonist and composer, turns 80 today — Tuesday, March 9, 2010 — and you call him up, introduce yourself and get invited over immediately.  You find him sitting there almost exactly as envisioned, in the darkened, quiet space, outlined in a cone of lamplight and writing away — not on music paper with staves and clefs, but rather on regular lined paper in a spiral notebook.  Are they hieroglyphics? Japanese characters? The calligraphy of the avant-garde? It turns out to be his left-handed stylish printing of notes — B-flats, G-sharps and such — arranged into strings and matrices. Such notation fills the pages of several notebooks stacked nearby.  Physically, Mr. Coleman may be perched on a high stool, dressed in a colorful print shirt, black slacks with suspenders and wine-colored loafers, but his mind is an antigravity chamber, floating in the mi,\'le of this room decorated with contemporary furniture and huge Modern paintings.
Aol launched Lifestream, a social aggregator and publisher, as part of their AIM platform at TechCrunch50 Last Fall. Since then it has gained nearly 2 million users, say Aol. Based on that success Aol is now launching Lifestream as a standalone product at lifestream.aol.com.  Like Friendfeed, Lifestream aggregates a number of third party social networks   Facebook, Twitter, MySpace, Foursquare, Delicious, Digg, Flickr, YouTube, etc., so if you follow a Lifestream user you\'ll see all of the content that user publishes on those networks, and Lifestream automatically pulls in content from people you already follow on those various social networks, so you don\'t have to create yet another new friend list. Lifestream isn\'t yet integrated with Google Buzz, but Aol says it may be coming soon.  Users can filter out content from specific networks if they like, on a per user or broad basis. A way to think about this   \'noise cancellation for social networks.\'  Lifestream also lets users publish back to social networks. Status updates posted to Lifestream can be posted back to Facebook, Myspace and/or Twitter. Lifestream also optionally notes your location in your status updates via GPS on mobile devices, or you can manually a,\' it instead.
As part of the Federal Trade Commission\'s ongoing hearings into the future of journalism, Google\'s chief economist, Hal Varian, gave a presentation on newspapers and their financial problems that is well worth taking some time to read (or view). The slide deck is embe,\'ed below, and Martin Langeveld has a great overview at the Nieman Journalism Lab that also includes a transcript of Varian\'s presentation. The Google economist (who also wrote a blog post) does a pretty thorough job of explaining the untenable position that newspapers currently find themselves in, and how it isn\'t the Internet\'s fault (in other words, it isn\'t Google\'s fault).  The biggest problem, Varian says, is that the news part of what newspapers do — the hard reporting and crime and investigative stuff that everyone thinks of when they say the word \'journalism\' — has traditionally been subsidized by all the rest of what newspapers do, such as the automotive section, the travel section, the lifestyle features and so on (which almost no one thinks of when they say the word \'journalism\'). Those other parts of the paper, unfortunately, are being targeted by subject-specific web sites and services, leaving the news part of the operation unprotected. As he put it:      Traditionally, the ad revenue from these special sections has been used to cross-subsidize the core news production. Nowadays internet users go directly to websites like Edmunds, Orbitz, Epicurious, and Amazon to look for products and services in specialized areas. Not surprisingly, advertisers follow those eyeballs, which makes the traditional cross-subsidization model that newspapers have used far more difficult.  Although it\'s admittedly a bit presumptuous to expect Varian to come up with solutions to this problem, he\'s a little light on the solutions front, mentioning Google\'s \'FastFlip\' experiment as one possible answer, as well as Living Stories and a couple of other Google projects. But one part of his presentation really hit home with me, and that was when he talked about the amount of time people spend with the news online. On average, he said, they spend about 70 seconds a day. Varian says part of the reason for that is people reading online at work, where they have less time to spend with the news.
It\'s a topic that would probably make the average individual\'s eyes glaze over, but will have a profound impact on the economy - for better or worse. The topic - financial regulation reform.  With Senate Banking Chairman Sen. Chris Do,\', D-Conn., setting his proposal out for the public, the take away on the reporting from two of the country\'s major newspapers - The New York Times and Wall Street Journal can give readers a view where their reporters\' loyalties lie.  On CNBC\'s March 15\'Squawk Box,\'co-host Joe Kernen raised this point - the Journal with its more pro-Wall Street point of view and the Times with a liberal pro-Democratic Party one.\'You - I like the way you highlighted the Journal\'s take, ‘Ohh, this thing is ahh, much worse,\' but The New York Times - ‘consensus-building,\'Kernen said.\'But The New York Times is talking about consensus-building within the Democratic Party, I think, right? I mean, normally that\'s who they\'re speaking to, isn\'t it?\'Read more: http://newsbusters.org/blogs/jeff-poor/2010/03/15/study-bias-two-takes-financial-regs-journal-vs-ny-times-pointed-out-cnbc-#ixzz0iPLPdgZG
Are you desperate for an iPad-like device, short on cash, and long on the desire to completely jack up your netbook? Well you\'re in luck, friend, as the proprietor of MSI Wind fansite Insanely Wind has crafted a device which may satiate your tablety desires. By taking a U100, removing the keyboard, relocating a touchscreen display to the bottom half of the unit, and doing some simple rewiring, user alexbates has fashioned a tablet which he says bests a device like the iPad or JooJoo with\'10 times the storage, twice the speed, external video (VGA), webcam, USB ports, and built-in multi card reader.\'Of course, as you can tell by the photos, this mod has a ways to go before it\'s got the fit and finish of the aforementioned devices, and you\'ll have rev up a compatible, hackintosh build of OS X to make it appropriately Apple-ish -- but it can clearly be done. While this isn\'t the first time we\'ve seen this type of modification, it\'s nice to see the love spreading to various  devices (and done in a fashion that doesn\'t seem overly complicated). From the sounds of things, this project hasn\'t hit its zenith yet, so we\'ll be keeping our eyes peeled for a more complete variation of the Windlet (our name). For now, hit the read link and keep up with the unfolding saga.
I am so surprised, that this early in March, we are already seeing very warm weather. In fact, we did not see the normal Canadian winter that I am used to, and the one that I was dreading. I guess it is nice to get a year off, every now and then.  There is still a lot of snow on the ground that needs to melt, but it is certainly well on its way. I go outside, and keep thinking that there is still so much snow to melt, but then I simply have to remember how much snow we had prior to the melt starting, and I know things are going down well.  I wonder though, if a milder winter this year, means a more intense winter next year? If That is the case, Zhifang will be in for a real eye opener, as Canada\'s winter can be something on the extreme side. Winter storms hit with a fury, and when all is said and done, the only thing you can do, is find your shovel and start digging out.
No, this isn\'t an obituary to my blog, though considering the level of inactivity this year, I suppose you could declare it brain dead.  Did that metaphor make sense? No? Good. I\'ve still got it.  But yes, I\'ve been just a bit stressed for time these days, especially now that my training is done and I\'m officially on permanent status. My restricted time on the internet is spent either reading blogs, sports news or chatting with people in time zones that really mess with my sleep cycle, none of which inspire a blog post.  And then I went to church.  It was one of the weekends that I was at home, and as usual I was busy trying to cram in all the things that I missed out during the week, i.e. dongle-free internet, movies, home cooked food, and driving (I really, really miss driving!). However, in an attempt to infuse my short weekend stay with more ‘family time\', my parents decided that I should come with them for a memorial service. You know what they say; nothing brings the family together like a corpse.  So I swing by, reluctantly, while pondering the appropriate ‘game face\' to put on while at a memorial service. Not too sad (it\'s not the funeral) and not too relaxed (you\'re supposed to miss the man). It was the 1 year death anniversary of a family acquaintance, an old planter that used to come to our church, and as I sat in the pews reading the order of the service, I realized that this was actually the first time I had attended a memorial service.  It was rather awkward for me personally, watching this little parade of children and grandchildren telling the assembly how much they miss this man. It seemed unnecessary to me; surely this would be better suited for a more private and personal gathering. However, the best was definitely saved for last, when the widow and the pastor got up to tell what a fantastic, god-fearing, church-loving man he was. How they could do so with a straight face, heaven only knows. They might as well have told me he was the antichrist\'s secretary.    After ensuring I had indeed heard this right, I started to wonder how people could be so forgiving of those that have passed before us. It\'s almost as if insults are forgiven by the time the body hits the floor, debts are forgiven by the time of the homily and extra-marital affairs and murder are forgiven by the time the sand starts piling up on the casket.  So is it only in death that we activate our ‘human spirit\'? Do we have to wait till our last breath has come and gone to see compassion, concern and selective amnesia in our fellow man? I\'m reminded of Mark Twain\'s \'Tom Sawyer\', when he and his friends staged their own funeral to milk the sympathy that they knew would be overflowing for them, despite them being a public nuisance.  When I was very young, I didn\'t see much of my father as he worked late, and so my five year old brain devised a way to ‘check\' how much I missed him. I would imagine him dying, or imagine hearing of his death, and then if I felt immensely sad about it, then I knew that I really did care and I really did miss him.  Silly, stupid, terrible   and yet, perhaps apt.  Bottom line: make sure you tell your friends all the things you hate about them right now! You never know when they may drop dead and put you in the unenviable position of having to lie through your teeth at church.
You wouldn\'t expect to find\'We\'ve tightened up the graphics on Episode Three\'among the usual list of noted improvements between Telltale\'s episodic releases. After all, with endearing, demented characters like Sam and Max taking up quite a bit of the screen, who cares how many polygons are left for that pot plant in the corner?\'We wanted to bump everything up presentation-wise for this season,\'said designer Chuck Jordan, drawing attention to the Telltale engine\'s impressive -- nay, tight -- visual enhancements. The Penal Zone, the first of five monthly episodes comprising Sam & Max: The Devil\'s Playhouse, features noticeably improved lighting, real-time shadows and more expressive facial animation. As Jordan pointed out,\'an expression can sell a joke for the first time.\'Based on the demo I saw at the Game Developers Conference, it\'s also apparent that the improved graphics do make a difference to that pot plant. Because you transform into one.\'When you finally get to control Max,\'Jordan sai,\'dit\'s really weird.\'Like, really really weird. Gallery: Sam & Max: Devil\'s Playhouse  One of Max\'s newly acquired psychic abilities (accessed from a bizarre first-person viewpoint) allows him to transform into any physical object -- provided he\'s seen it in the form of a picture or a painting somewhere in the environment (obviously). It\'s an interesting puzzle-solving device that introduces an ability-driven approach to complement the traditional reliance on inventory item ... and since it lets Max turn into stuff like pot plants and bazookas, it\'s also super funny.  More psychic abilities will be unlocked as the season continues -- can they really get stranger than pictorial transformation or telephonic teleportation? -- but the first few already show that Telltale is cognizant of the formulaic fallbacks in a few of its games. Inventory manipulation has also been inverted, prompting you to select an object in the environment first and then pick an item to use from a redesigned interface. Those changes seem to benefit the PlayStation 3 version of The Devil\'s Playhouse, which also abandons the point-and-click interface in favor of direct control over the demented duo on the left analogue stick.  Of course, it\'s also worth pointing out that Telltale\'s excellent, unhinged humor still plays a crucial role in Sam & Max: The Devil\'s Playhouse. I don\'t think fans will be disappointed by the delightful B-movie trappings, not when there\'s a talking brain, a megalomaniacal ape and a host of unanswered mysteries right from the start. Only an enigmatic narrator (Criswell\'s cousin?) hints at an explanation, but it\'s clear that the inevitably absurd answers will gradually be exposed as the season continues from its potent opener.
The current push for government-run health care via the nuclear option  and last week\'s Blair House TV snooze-orama are clear demonstrations that Barack Obama, Nancy Pelosi, and Harry Reid share Vladimir Lenin\'s tenacity to impose radical change where it\'s not welcome — in fact, where there\'s downright hostility to change by a solid majority of Americans.  And make no mistake, Lenin was first and foremost about the will to power.  Gale winds of public disapproval may be blowing against proposed government-run health care and its proponents, but Obama and congressional Democratic leaders plod forward with stolid determination, now extending by six weeks the time to work through an acceptable framework to pass so-called health care reform. If that extension fails to secure health care reform legislation, then these leaders may seek another extension, if possible, in an effort to wear down opposition to their designs.  Before liberals level charges of red-baiting, I\'ll offer that the differences between Lenin and the Bolsheviks and Obama and left-wing Democrats are significant, many, and varied. Through skullduggery, battle, and blood, Lenin established a dictatorship of the proletariat, which history has amply shown was a thinly veiled dictatorship by Lenin and his Communist Party heirs.  There was nothing \'soft\' about Lenin\'s tyranny or Stalin\'s. The mass graves of tens of millions of victims bear mute testament to these despots\' infamy.  Obama, Pelosi, and Reid are decidedly pale reds, or as was said in an earlier generation, \'pinkos.\' But all three have grand ambitions, make no mistake, to achieve through imposition the social — or should it be said, socialist — democracy that lies with deadening weight across the width and breadth of Western Europe. These three Democratic leaders are working within our system of government to fundamentally alter government\'s relationship to the people. If these three succeed, the American experiment in liberty will effectively end.  The president and the two congressional leaders are so blinded by their ideology, so bullheaded in accomplishing a radical transformation of health care, that they\'ve discarded the common sense and instinct for self-preservation that usually governs politicians\' actions. Instead, this triumvirate makes rationalizations for support of a proposal that\'s been DOA almost from its inception.
I awoke to all the snow reports in the area reading between two and four inches. Then it was off to the webcams and CDOT cams. Vail Pass looked snowy and so did the top of Sun Up, I was head over the pass today for some more turns at Vail.   Conditions were awesome, or crappy, depending on who you rode with on the chair. I will go with the former as will my new friend I made on High Noon. We lapped the chair a couple times together and both decided that although there was a definite crust under that few inches of fluff, it was pretty damn good skiing.   The outside parts of the feet started to get to the point of ice bricks and the wind was biting my face. After four hours of powder hunting I decided it was time to head to the front side and get back to the truck. Stopped to buy the essentials for some chili, now off to tend to that.
Windows Phone 7 Series. Get used to the name, because it\'s now a part of the smartphone vernacular... however verbose it may seem. Today Microsoft launches one of its most ambitious (if not most ambitious) projects: the rebranding of Windows Mobile. The company is introducing the new mobile OS at Mobile World Congress 2010, in Barcelona, and if the press is anything to be believed, this is just the beginning. The phone operating system does away with pretty much every scrap of previous mobile efforts from Microsoft, from the look and feel down to the underlying code -- everything is brand new. 7 Series has rebuilt Windows Mobile from the ground up, featuring a completely altered home screen and user interface experience, robust Xbox LIVE and Zune integration, and vastly new and improved social networking tools. Gone is the familiar Start screen, now replaced with\'tiles\'which scroll vertically and can be customized as quick launches, links to contacts, or self contained widgets. The look of the OS has also been radically upended, mirroring the Zune HD experience closely, replete with that large, iconic text for menus, and content transitions which elegantly (and dimensionally) slide a user into and out of different views. The OS is also heavily focused on social networking, providing integrated contact pages which show status updates from multiple services and allow fast jumps to richer cloud content (such as photo galleries). The Xbox integration will include LIVE games, avatars, and profiles, while the Zune end of things appears to be a carbon copy of the standalone device\'s features (including FM radio).  Besides just flipping the script on the brand, the company seems to be taking a much more vertical approach with hardware and user experience, dictating rigid specs for 7 Series devices (a specific CPU and speed, screen aspect ratio and resolution, memory, and even button configuration), and doing away with carrier or partner UI customizations such as Sense or TouchWiz. That\'s right -- there will be a single Windows Phone identity regardless of carrier or device brand. Those new phones will likely look similar at first, featuring a high res touchscreen, three front-facing buttons (back, start, and perhaps not shockingly, a Bing key), and little else.  Carrier partnerships are far and wide, including AT&T, Deutsche Telekom AG, Orange, SFR, Sprint, Telecom Italia, Telefónica, Telstra, T-Mobile USA, Verizon Wireless and Vodafone, while hardware partners include Dell, Garmin-Asus, HTC, HP, LG, Samsung, Sony Ericsson, Toshiba and Qualcomm. We\'re told that we likely won\'t get to see any third-party devices at MWC, though Microsoft is showing off dev units of unknown origin, and the first handsets are supposed to hit the market by the holidays of this year.
In one room, Meade Esposito, the Democratic boss from Brooklyn, was tightening his grip on the Brooklyn waterfront.  Next door, New York\'s former mayor, John V. Lindsay, was struggling with the teachers strike of 1968. And in the third room, an idealistic young woman from the Midwest was trying to teach poetry at Rikers Island.  It was just another day at a recording studio in Manhattan where New York stories are lifted off the printed page and into the spoken word for blind New Yorkers seeking audio versions of books about their city.  The little-known service is run by the New York Public Library out of the Andrew Heiskell Braille and Talking Book Library on West 20th Street.  \'A lot of the books we record fall into that ‘New Yorkana\' category,\' said Susan Mosakowski, a playwright and theater producer who runs the program, which puts out up to 50 titles a year, many of them New York-related books that have not had wide enough appeal to have been recorded by a publisher. \'We have a lot of readers asking for books with a local interest, a local focus,\' she said.  Dozens of New York-related books are displayed here: \'NYPD: A City and Its Police,\' by James Lardner and Thomas Reppetto;\' \'The Seltzer Man\' by Ken Rush, about a veteran Brooklyn seltzer-schlepper; \'Upper West Side Story,\' by Peter Salwen.  A federal regulation enacted in the 1990s allows the library to record audio versions of books without having to secure publishing rights. Ms. Mosakowski has the luxury of being able to draw on New York City\'s deep pool of vocal talent. Readers have included the Broadway actor Jeffrey Kuhn and Julie Pasqual, a storyteller, dancer and circus clown.
Last season, the Cleveland Browns were...for lack of a better term, a hot mess. It all stemmed from the quarterback position, where 2007 first round pick Brady Quinn and relative journeyman Derek Anderson took turns not really getting anything done. Sure, the Browns won their last four games of the season, but they still finished 5-11, and that late run was largely due to running back Jamal Harrison, who tallied 558 of his 852 rushing yards in the team\'s final three games. As soon as the season ended, they agreed to bring in Mike Holmgren, the former head coach of both the Green Bay Packers and Seattle Seahawks who currently has a number of former assistants working in head coaching jobs around the league. Back in January, on Dan Patrick\'s radio show, Holmgren said that he would be sure to decide on a quarterback before training camp started and stick with him. Little did we know he wasn\'t actually referring to anyone that was on the roster at that time. I personally was certain he was talking about Brady Quinn, since it\'s just not necessary to devote time to Derek Anderson, who is as WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) as they come under center. However, the events of the past week have been truly surprising, and have me re-evaluating Holmgren\'s plan. Anderson - considered a backup by most - was released, no shock there. However, Cleveland brought in ex-Seahawk (and Holmgren draftee) Seneca Wallace to replace Anderson. They also have reportedly told teams that Quinn is available in trades, brought recent ex-Carolina Panther Jake Delhomme in for a visit today, and a
We went to an outdoor Symphony presentation of the BBC Blue Planet. The Fine Arts Museum has a hillside that provides near perfect seating for such an event. And it only rained enough to cause them to pass out free raincoats (flimsy but effective), not to get soaked.......  A friend Ken Elder passed away...one more farewell gathering missed while in Taiwan.  We drove, well Melissa did, we rode, to Taichung to support a fundraiser and visit some friends that teach at Morrison Academy who Melissa went to Russia with in 1994. Yep THAT long ago!  About 2/3 of the way there Melissa\'s car overheated. We stopped at a rest stop. Store, gas station and restrooms. (90 urinals)! Once we a,\'ed 2 liters of water and the engine cooled some off we went. WELL about 20 minutes later we pulled over and (short version) rode in the car on the back of a flat bed tow truck into the next city to get a new thermostat and radiator. Sunday morning no less! AND back on the road in 2 hours!  We had dinner at Ponderosa, there are 2 in Taichung, with the Robarts then went back to their apartment for a short visit before driving home. It sure was nice to NOT have the extra servicing stops! This time the rest stop only had about 60 urinals..........  It was like driving to Regina and back for the day. WE\'D NEVER DO THAT! Well ALMOST, never!! Dogs and Monday morning hair appointments pressed the return decision.  This afternoon I was out walking and noticed one clinic \'UROLOGY AND DERMATOLOGY\' A curious combination in my limited experience! My mind wondered........I\'ll let you do yours and keep mine to myself, thank you very much.........  Well that\'s about it!
At our Mobilize 09 conference, Frank Meehan, CEO of London-based INQ, told me that his company was going to follow on the heels of its successful Facebook phone with more devices, including lower-cost smartphones targeting fast-growing mobile markets such as India. Today, the company launched its social mobile phones in India — and INQ has roped in MS Dhoni, captain of Indian cricket team, as its spokesperson. Aircel, a mobile carrier, will be selling the device to its customers. The INQ Mini 3G and the INQ Chat 3G will be available in India. The INQ Chat 3G is a QWERTY device. The highly competitive Indian mobile market has made it difficult for carriers to bank solely on voice revenues. The INQ devices are being made available at a time when Indian carriers are looking for ways to goose their data revenues.
Senator John Barrasso M.D. (R-WY), ranking member of the Subcommittee on Oversight in the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, recently released a report [PDF]on the subcommittee\'s work in the first year of the Obama Administration. The report has less to it than might be imagined — in the first year, the subcommittee has failed to meet or to hold a single hearing of its own. \'There were exactly two hearings in 2009,\' Barrasso said, \'a joint hearing with the full committee on June 9th, and a joint hearing with the Subcommittee on Water and Wildlife on July 8th.\'  The subcommittee was chartered by Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA), chair of the Environment and Public Works Committee, to perform oversight on the science involved with environmental issues. \'Senator Boxer wanted the subcommittee to perform oversight on the Bush Administration, not the current administration,\' Senator Barrasso said.  \'We have made repeated requests to the chairman of the subcommittee [Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI)] to hold hearings [in the past year] but no hearings have been held. It has been a lost year for science oversight in the Senate.\'  \'There have been plenty of reasons to hold hearings,\' Barrasso said. \'For example, in April 2009, Shawn McGibbon, a career attorney with Small Business Administration, wrote part of a memo saying the EPA had not considered the economic consequences of an Endangerment Finding for carbon dioxide.\' When the memo became known, McGibbons was \'smeared as a ‘Bush holdover\' even though she was hired during the Clinton Administration. Later, McGibbons was replaced by President Obama.  In another incident, Dr. Alan Carlin, a 39-year veteran of the EPA, prepared a report skeptical of the real human impact on the climate.  Carlin (who has since written several articles for Pajamas Media) was instructed not to disseminate the report and, as Kim Strassel reported in the Wall Street Journal, was denounced by \'unnamed EPA officials\' as a \'climate change denier.\' Dr. Carlin eventually left the EPA.
Recommendation engine Hunch confirms that they\'ve raised a new round of financing   $12 million   led by Khosla Ventures. Partner Gideon Yu, who joined  Khosla Ventures last year, was previously the CFO of Facebook. He is now joining Hunch\'s board of directors as part of the deal. Hunch was valued at $52 million in the round.  I spoke to cofounder Caterina Fake this evening about the round. Fake says that Hunch, which is less than a year old, now has lots of data to work with in making recommendations. In fact, she says, users have answered nearly 50 million questions on Hunch since launch, and the company can use that data to make better and better recommendations.  Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales joined the company\'s board of directors in late 2009.
It goes without saying that timing is everything. You can be like Friendster and show up too soon to the social networking party and then blow it. Or you can be like the iPod and make a splash despite being a late entrant to the MP3 player market. Unity Technologies, a 3-D gaming platform, has seen this movie from all sides. After struggling for nearly six years, the company\'s gaming platform took off when Apple released iPhone and iPod touch.  With a platform that lets developers build lightweight, online 3-D games — perfectly suited for the iPhone OS-based devices — Unity became a disruptor in the games business virtually overnight. And it\'s been on a bit of a roll over the past year, with a client roster that includes big names like Electronic Arts, the Cartoon Network and Disney. Mobile developers love the company, which secured a $5.5 million Series A round led by Sequoia in October of 2009. But it wasn\'t always salad days for the company, which was originally based in Copenhagen, Denmark and is now headquartered in the Bay Area, as is made clear in my chat with Unity CEO David Helgason.
What do you think of when everything around you su,\'enly slows down? When you are acutely aware of every tenth of a second as it passes?  I woke up Saturday morning to Kat\'s music in her room. When I looked in on her, she was dancing. Spinning in circles with her arms and hands outstretched, a huge smile on her face with her hair thrown around.\'UP, Da,\'y! UP!\'So I picked her up and danced to Itsy bitsy spider. Her face in mine, watching her smile and hearing her giggle. We spun around together like grinning fools, enjoying the moment. Nothing else really mattered.  AS the truck tire fell off the pavement, the DOT hadn\'t plowed and the front end swung around, I wasn\'t driving fast. Maybe 55 MPH. The roads were a mess, snow covered and no way to tell where the shoulder hid, waiting to pull you down to a catastrophe.  The boy has been sick. He had my cold and now has my cough. He has a rash and other problems that make him miserable. Last night Jill and I held him and tried to comfort him. He would have none of it. He stood and screamed at the injustice of it all; why did HE have to hurt? Did he really want these teeth? We held him and tried to comfort him and share his frustration.  The truck is sliding sideways, free of friction from the road and the tires held to nothing, just sliding over snow and ice. The headlights pointed into the median and the road starting to curve into my travel. Counter steer, just like I was taught in drivers ed, over 25 years ago. Pray, just like I was taught at home nearly 40 years ago.  Kat, wound up and cranky. Cabin fever making her temper boil. I found her at the door, in her jacket, hat and mittens. Crying to DO SOMETHING. Outside? Sled, she tells me. So I dressed quickly, put on her boots and carried her out and got the sled. I tell her to hold on and enjoy! She is going down the hill, faster and farther. Looking back for the security of da,\'y watching over her. Laughter and dancing, jumping up and down. Again! Again. Four trips in all, up the hill, position in the sled and point down the hill. GO! down the hill, faster than before, I hear her calling, Da,\'y!  There is a van stuck in the median. The truck has swung nearly 180* and I see the van coming up on my left. Or is it? The van is still, I am shooting towards it when the back of the truck hits the thick, wet, sticky snow of the median and the front end snaps around like a whip. The van seems to pass me by, when I should know I am the passer by. Nose into the deeper snow, slowing down as though I just drove into a lake. Snow splashing up all around, I see the snow pass over the hood and past my windows. How deep will I go?  Sunday morning, Jill took Kyle to the dr, leaving Kat home with me. Kat is mommy\'s little girl and spends a half hour crying for MOMMY! and looking all over the house trying to find her mommy. I distract her finally with the music from the day before and once again we are dancing, cheek to cheek. In a rare moment of perspective, I marvel and appreciate the moment. She doesn\'t want me to hold her often and we don\'t dance together.\'This is precious and I don\'t want it to stop.\'I am in the moment and I know what priceless really means.  The truck is nearly in the other lane. Headlights flash in front of me, staring into my eyes. This makes it hard to see and I have my eyes open to meet my fate. What will happen when I finally come to rest? I am now heading back towards the mi,\'le of the median, snow showering all around me. Will my planner hit me in the head? Will my flashlight shake free and fracture my teeth? Will I be a burden to my family, paralyzed or blind? Is this all karma; am I wearing clean underwear?  A rough night last night. Wife and I got back to sleep around 530. We snuggled up close and dozed off. We had each gone to the children to help them get through the night and back to sleep. One woke the other and they both resented the interruption of sleep. We all did. Jill and I hit snooze and we wound ourselves closer to one another. I murmured in her ear; we used to do this every morning, BK. We cu,\'led and snuggled and stored up love and affection like squirrels storing nuts, corporate life is like a stark freezing Iowa winter. Store up your love and affection because outside of this house you don\'t have many friends or allies to help nourish your spirit. Some days that nourishment of your spirit runs out before you get to the safe haven of home.  I realize the truck has some response in the wheel. Maybe I can, I think. I am at the bottom of the hill, I have been plowing snow for a quarter mile. Give it some gas and steer. The worst that can happen is unthinkable; the best that can happen is still possible. The truck responds to the foot feed and slogs its way in the deep snow. Thirty more yards, twenty then five and OUT! We are on the road! Careful, don\'t go to the other ditch and look for cars coming down that hill! Keep driving a little faster, up to 45 and pointed in the right direction. Lets get home carefully, safely; ten miles to go and the road isn\'t any cleaner.  I park the truck at home and feel kind of weak. shut the garage door and go inside. It is too much to hope the kids are up; it is 8:15. DA,\'Y\'S HOME. A bundle of long brown curly hair runs out of her bedroom and throws herself around my knees. UP, UP, UP she commands. I pick up my daughter and a tear slides down my cheek. Jill comes into the kitchen carrying Kyle and we have a group hug. A hug has never been more precious or needed than right at that moment. I would freeze that moment in time if I could and never regret it.   I feel like it took thirty minutes to drive through that median and another hour to get home but that hug lasted for barely an instant.
The Nexus One is coming to Verizon — no, really, two months after a deal was announced by Google, the device is on its way. HTC has begun shipping the CDMA version of Google\'s Nexus One to Verizon Wireless, according to a report in the Chinese-language Economic Daily News (hat tip, Digitimes). The nation\'s largest carrier will begin selling the gadget in the next few weeks, joining T-Mobile USA, which has supported the \'Google phone\' since its January launch. But that won\'t do much to boost Google\'s mobile effort unless Mountain View throws some real marketing muscle behind the Nexus One.  There\'s a lot to like about the Nexus One, which Om has praised as \'the best Android phone yet.\' The phone rocks the powerful 1 GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon processor and solid mobile browser, and is closely integrated with applications from both Google and third-party developers. But sales have been tremendously disappointing, prompting Goldman Sachs last week to slash its 2010 sales estimates for the Nexus One by a whopping 70 percent.  That lack of movement can be directly traced to an almost utter lack of marketing for the phone. (That\'s a lesson Palm has learned with its Pre. Twice.) Google\'s promotion of its flagship device consisted largely of a placing a modest link on its home page, and carriers — which are rightly terrified of their brands being elbowed out of the way — have only minimally backed the gadget. Worse, the phone is available only through Google\'s online store, which most smartphone shoppers surely don\'t even know exists. And that model isn\'t likely to change with Verizon Wireless, as Kevin at jkOnTheRun noted last week.  Google has said since January that the Nexus One would be coming to Verizon Wireless, and the company is wise to combine its impressive hardware with Verizon\'s rock-solid network. But if Google is really going to move the needle with its flagship device, it\'s going to have to back it with some big-budget marketing campaigns.
During the review of the Environmental Protection Agency budget in today\'s Senate Environment and Public Works Committee hearing, both Senator Barbara Boxer — the chair of the committee — and EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson distanced themselves from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report (AR4).  Boxer and Jackson\'s statements, in a,\'ition to being a striking change in policy, are problematic because U.S. climate science is very closely tied to the IPCC reports (as Christopher Horner showed in his recent PJM series on the NASA FOIA emails.)  The statements by Boxer and Jackson followed Senator Inhofe\'s release (see the PJM exclusive report) in his opening statement of a minority staff report documenting many flaws in the IPCC report and the other evidence revealed in the Climategate files. (See the full hearing on CSPAN here; the exchanges with Senator Boxer and Inhofe, and Administrator Jackson begin at about 56 minutes into the video.)
Hey BlackBerry friends -- we\'ve got some news for you. The Engadget application (which is also available for the iPhone / iPod touch  and webOS devices) has gone and gotten itself a little update on RIM\'s platform. It\'s nothing crazy, but we\'ve made some bug fixes, and more importantly, a,\'ed support for 5.0 devices (Bold, Curve, and Tour)! The devs also thoughtfully included keyboard shortcuts (T, B, N, P, and the spacebar) in this version for your convenience. All you have to do to get your hands on this baby is point your phone\'s browser to our download page, or if you\'ve already got the app installed, it should prompt you for an update automatically next time you open it. Storm users -- we are working on a version for you as well, and everyone who is curious about the Android app: you should see it released this month!
Time for your Tuesday edition of the Deadspin Funbag. Find more of Drew\'s stuff at KSK or on Twitter. Today, we\'re poop, menus, Minesweeper, afros, death, Gatorade, gayness, and more.  I\'ve been losing weight recently, and one of the joys of losing weight is overemphasizing my own awe at my body\'s transformation.\'Why are my pants so loose? Why am I not sweating in my sleep? I feel stronger. More agile. WHAT\'S HAPPENING TO MY BODY?\'I\'m not saying I\'m becoming Spiderman, but I wouldn\'t rule out such things. Also, my old Kasabian shirt fits again. It\'s the little things. Onto your letters.  Carlos:      Me and my brother have come to the conclusion that whoever dies first will haunt the shit out of the other person. I\'m gonna be a bad motherfuckin\' ghost if I die, I will pull your teeth while you sleep, you bastard. FEAR ME.  Well, that\'s the main issue. Can you move around tangible objects when you\'re a ghost? Because that would be awesome. If you\'re a ghost, you have to be bored out of your mind, what with the whole stuck in purgatory business. The only thing there is to do if you\'re a ghost is spend most of your time fucking with the living. And so, like Carlos, I\'d be a HUGE dick if I were a ghost. I\'d turn on the faucets while you were taking a shit, just so you\'d clench up, break off the turd, and get all mad. Also, I\'d write out lots of vague messages on steamy bathroom mirrors. Shit like, THIS IS THE DAWN OF THE END. Also, I\'d implore people in the house to avenge my death, even if I died normally. They don\'t know I died of a heart attack, so why not give them the illusion that I was murdered in the house, and that they must find the killer? OLD MAN JENKINS NEXT DOOR! YOU CAN\'T TRUST HIM!  There are times, late at night, when my wife is asleep but I\'m still tossing and turning, when I wonder if our house is haunted. It\'s not. But what if the specter of some old lady came through the wall and just stared at me? What would I do, apart from shit my pants? I visualize that shit, and then it fucks with me the rest of the night.  At college, one of the guys I sat on the football bench with told me his dorm room was haunted. One night, he was sleeping in his bed. He stirred, opened his eyes, and saw a dark figure standing by the bed. When he reached to touch the figure, his hand went through it. He turned on the light and there was nothing there. HAUNTED! Sure, he was almost certainly lying. But then again, there could have been a girl who had her throat slit by a demented professor in that very same room. I rule out nothing. Just once, I\'d like to find myself in a haunted house or hotel room. Just so I can tell people of my brush with the paranormal.  I get very annoyed with reality shows about ghosts (like Ghost Hunters) that supposedly track ghosts and then come up with proof that includes a video still featuring a smudge of light glare. That\'s no ghost, you fuckers. Where are the chains?!
This has been the long, hot summer of ObamaCare. The president\'s plan to change our health care system has led to ugly confrontations between ardent supporters and those who want no part of it. Repeatedly, arguments have broken out where opponents object to some provision and the president\'s zealots retort that they\'re lying or have been duped.  I would like to suggest that such arguments are beside the point. The specifics of the legislation are shifting and liable to change. What\'s really important is the overall concept. We\'re used to hearing that \'the devil is in the details,\' but in this instance, we should instead concentrate on the big picture.  Here is the big picture: Do we want a health care system that\'s overwhelmingly political in nature? President Obama believes we need a system mainly directed by federal mandates and prohibitions. If he has his way, our already somewhat politicized system would become heavily politicized. Supposedly that would be in the public interest.  There are many Americans, however, who think that a heavily politicized health care system would be much worse. I\'m among them. We believe, fundamentally, that systems of any kind that are dominated by politics do not do a good job of satisfying human needs. Whether it\'s health care, food, housing, or anything else, government intrusion leads to increasing costs, declining quality, and the loss of freedom.  We get far better results from systems based on freedom and voluntary exchange. When individuals make decisions, they know their own circumstances and will either benefit from good choices or suffer the consequences of bad ones. That creates a strong incentive to make good choices and quickly change when you realize you\'ve made a mistake.
I\'m back from my trip overseas and had a blast! But fun was coupled with sadness as day 1 I lose my phone :( That screwed a bit with my plans to tour around as I lost my handy internet-in-pocket device. Germany was great, meetings went really well and the weather was great. Then onto Amsterdam for vacation where it rained a bit everyday, but was still decent weather (and much better than home, so no complaints). One of the work guys ended up coming with me and we met up with friends from his old job. It was definitely a blast being down there with a big group of Canadians right in the mi,\'le of the Olympics. Especially since everywhere but North America lists the medal count by # of Golds, so Canada was #1.  Don\'t really want to type out any stories from the trip, but small \'highlights\' were: Losing phone, breaking glasses, waking up in a small pool of blood (lol), yummy schnitzel, a million gorgeous Audis, Dutch girls > German girls, Casino fun / insane beats, crazy last minute bookings and contingency plans, touring Red Light district, shopping, etc etc.  Really can\'t wait for another trip like this, I love travelling...but the downside, I missed my son like crazy! It was SO nice when I got him back. We\'ve had a lot of fun so far since I got back especially because the weather\'s starting to be nice finally. We\'re spending a lot of time outside as he chases down birds and plays with rocks etc. He chases me down the street with his hands up to his head like horns or antlers all the while growling as loud as he can. It\'s hilarious and passerby\'s can\'t help but laugh too. On my trip there were so many times I wish I had him with me, love being reunited.    BUT you know what\'s insanely stupid?!?! Ex never went to visit her family. No road trip, nothing. Ie, absolutely no reason to use the piece of L\'s luggage I requested and was adamantly denied since she\'needed\'it. Such BS!
Using a camera as an input device is hardly a new idea -- even on a mobile device -- but most examples so far have been to enable functionality not possible on a touchscreen. As Master\'s student Daniel Bierwirth has shown in the video after the break, however, a phone on a camera can also be used as an alternative input method for features like scrolling or zooming, potentially allowing for easier interaction on devices with smaller screens. Bierwirth also takes the idea one step further, and sees the system eventually including a second camera that\'s worn by a person, which would be able to detect when your hands are near the phone and allow for a range of other gestures. Check out his full report at the link below.
To find out what the situation is like in Angers, I decided to go and have a walk around the city centre, and see what was open, what was closed, and if I came across any angry protestors. Angry protestors I did not find. But was Angers crippled by these strikes or not? Let\'s find out.  When walking into down, it did appear to me that it felt a bit quieter than normal. There did not seem to be same number of cars which there normally are through the city centre. There were fewer buses running today in Angers, but not to the extent where there were no buses. There seemed to be adequate buses running and on the buses there did not seem to be crushes of people trying to get anywhere.  Moving into the town, no shops or banks were closed. It did not seem that any of Angers\' banks were closed.  The main thing which I found in the town was an increase in children. When walking into town, I noticed that the school near where I live was closed: I could see chairs on tables in the building. In town, it was evident that schools and colleges were closed. In the centre of town there were college students skateboarding in the central square, which usually happens only at weekends.  Moreover, there were many mothers with their children in town today. Seemingly trying to find something to do with them. Many times I saw a mother with one or two children with her. Also I came across a snake of 20 or so 4 or 5 year olds being looked after two or three women. Seemingly not enough of them to look after the children who they were looking after.  Also I came across a group of 14/15 year olds walking through town, about 25/30 of them, obviously not at school today, on a kind of shopping trip instead, all of them with H&M bags.  The amount of children and teenagers in the town centre obviously meant that many educational establishments were today closed today.  I then went across town to check out what was happening at the station. On the face of things you wouldn\'t know anything was wrong. All the cancelled trains appear to have been taken off the departure board to hide the problems perhaps. Whatever, there seemed to be enough trains running today through Angers, only difference on the board was the a,\'ition of \'Autocar\' by some destinations.  Even the post office was open, albeit with a reduced service. Evidently some staff must have stayed away as there was a sign at the door saying that they were only serving people who wanted to send mail or make cash withdrawals.  Services like the firemen seemed to be unaffected, luckily! However when passing the fire station I did see the following:
Custom computer cases that look like spiders aren\'t generally the sort of thing that are available to public, but Lian Li\'s new PC-T1R case is one big exception to the rule, and it\'s now edged a bit closer to a release. Previously only seen in a teaser video, a nearly final version of the case has now landed in the hands of the folks at techPowerUp, who have provided us with our first hands-on look at it. What\'s more, the site also says that the case should sell for\'around €150\'(or just over $200) when it\'s released, and that it will be available in black in a,\'ition to red. Of course, there will be some assembly required -- hit up the link below to see what\'s in store.
The New York Times\'s City Room blog included a Friday piece on the orphaned Web site of Hiram Monserrate, a former state senator who is again running for office.  From\'When Not to Accept Comments:\'Now, as many will remember, the former Queens legislator was tossed out of the State Senate in February after he was convicted of assaulting his female companion. His vacant seat will be filled in a special election on March 16 — an election in which, improbably, the disgraced Mr. Monserrate is also a candidate, on the newly formed and hopefully (or is it cynically?) named Yes We Can! line. (This proves, definitively, that you can usually find more than enough New Yorkers to take part in any crazy idea you have.)      Candidate Monserrate (Yes We Can, Queens) doesn\'t have a Web site for this campaign. But a few disgruntled residents found his old site and left some less-than-friendly messages.  Conveniently left unmentioned is the party to which Monserrate claimed allegiance as recently as last month.  As reported in The New York Times on February 9, 2010:      The State Senate on Tuesday expelled a senator convicted of domestic assault, the first time in nearly a century that the Legislature has forced a member from office.      The Senate voted 53-to-8 to immediately oust the senator, Hiram Monserrate, a Queens Democrat convicted last fall of a misdemeanor for dragging his companion down the hallway of his apartment building.  Amazing, isn\'t it, how quickly party affiliation is overlooked when the perp is a Democrat?  And yet, as documented repeatedly here on NewsBusters, quite predictable.

Many people (including myself) have come to the conclusion that Gmail, with its threaded messages, spam filtering, and vast storage space, is one of the web\'s best webmail providers. In fact, we like it so much that we use it for both our personal accounts and work accounts using Google Apps. But that also poses a problem: many of us wind up having to maintain two separate Google accounts, which means we have to swap logins whenever our Gmail, Reader, or other data is stored under the other account. Fortunately, there may be an end in sight for this juggling act.  As today\'s SXSW panel on Gmail came to a close, the panelists revealed one last juicy tidbit: they\'re working to resolve the problems with multiple namespaces that users have to deal with. The team didn\'t get specific — they simply repeated that they have to deal with the same problems, as they have \'@google.com\' accounts for work and standard Gmail accounts for personal use. And they know it\'s a pain.  There\'s no time frame, and we have no idea what form the feature will take. But at least we know Google is working on it.
Did you watch any of the health-care summit yesterday in Washington? Guess what? The Republicans and Democrats are divided and likely can\'t find any common ground. All the morning press reports suggest that the Democrats may now use the parliamentary procedure known as\'reconciliation\'to pass a health-care bill with a simple majority and without any Republicans.  Rather than just repeat the arguments I\'ve made repeatedly about the critical need for health-care reform in this country, and to include the tens of millions who are currently without health insurance (and sounding like a Democrat to some of you), let\'s get theological. Republicans, of course, have also used reconciliation before to pass measures they wanted--like the Bush tax cuts. So, let\'s look at that theologically.  First, the tax cuts that George Bush pushed through Congress overwhelmingly benefited the richest people in America--virtually all analysts agree with that fact. But many Americans haven\'t really calculated that the cost of those tax cuts for the rich was literally double what health-care reform is projected to cost. Double. Yet, there was not even a mention from Republicans, then or now, about the fiscal cost of such enormous tax cuts for the wealthiest people in America. And now they are doing everything they can to stoke public outrage about the cost of health-care reform (even though the Congressional Budget Office says the President\'s proposal will likely reduce the deficit by $100 billion over the next decade). How does that square with the biblical emphasis on the priority of the poor? There is simply no way to justify the habitual behavior of the current Republican party\'s clear preference for the rich over everybody else. Probably my best friend in the Congress was Republican Senator Mark Hatfield. The current Republican Party is a very different one than it was in Hatfield\'s time. I know he would not have liked the\'theology\'of his party today.  Second, the largest single government discretionary expense is for the military, for fighting wars. Military spending is also, historically, the most wasteful form of government spending with cost overruns, fiscal abuse, political corruption, and shameful pork barrel interests all part of standard operating procedures. So why is there a continual refusal from Republicans to apply their concerns about waste, fraud, and abuse about government expenditures to those expenditures? How does that square with the biblical call to peacemaking and the Christian doctrine that is, at least, suspicious of war as the answer to the problems of human conflict, which should either be outright rejected or very reluctantly accepted as an absolute last resort? There is simply no possible biblical mandate for giving the military a blank check as the current Republicans almost always do now. Again, this would have been bad theology for the evangelical Mark Hatfield, who courageously opposed the war in Vietnam.
CNN went into full tilt in promoting its upcoming pro-gender\'reassignment\'documentary\'Her Name Was Steven\'with Anderson Cooper\'s interview of Chastity\'Chaz\'Bono, the daughter of Sonny Bono and Cher, on his AC360 program on Thursday. Cooper very sympathetically interviewed Bono, and threw softball questions, even going so far as to ask,\'How do you like shaving?\'The anchor heralded the\'extraordinary transformation\'of his guest at the top of the 10 pm Eastern hour, and noted that\'in a rare interview, he [Bono] talks about life as a man and the journey he\'s still undergoing.\'Prior to the first segment of the interview at the bottom of the hour, Cooper aired a report from CNN\'s Gary Tuchman on\'how Chastity became Chaz.\'The correspondent confused the English language to the point of referring to Bono with a male possessive pronoun at the beginning of a sentence, and then referring Bono as\'she\'within the same breath. Story Continues Below Ad ?  Tuchman\'s report featured three sound bites from People Magazine\'s Mike Fleeman, who also contributed to the confusion by referring to\'he\'[Bono] having a procedure normally associated with women:      TUCHMAN (voice-over): Today, his name is Chaz Bono, but back then, she was Chastity Bono: not just her parents\' sweetheart, but an American sweetheart....      FLEEMAN: Chaz has given very little specific information about the actual procedure. We know that he\'s had a mastectomy. We know that he\'s been taking the proper hormones, know that he had a hysterectomy for unrelated reasons in the past, know that he\'s living completely as a man, know that he started shaving for the first time.

At this time of year, the sun does not rise at all this far north of the Arctic Circle. But Karen Margrethe Kuvaas says she has not been able to sleep well for days.  What is keeping her awake are the far-reaching ripple effects of the troubled housing market in sunny Florida, California and other parts of the United States.  Ms. Kuvaas is the mayor of Narvik, a remote seaport where the season\'s perpetual gloom deepened even further in recent days after news that the town — along with three other Norwegian municipalities — had lost about $64 million, and potentially much more, in complex securities investments that went sour.  \'I think about it every minute,\' Ms. Kuvaas, 60, said in an interview, her manner polite but harried. \'Because of this, we can\'t focus on things that matter, like schools or care for the elderly.\'  Norway\'s unlucky towns are the latest victims — and perhaps the least likely ones so far — of the credit crisis that began last summer in the American subprime mortgage market and has spread to the farthest reaches of the world, causing untold losses and sowing fears about the global economy.  Where all the bad debt ended up remains something of a mystery, but to those hit by the collateral damage, it hardly matters.
Howell Raines lost his executive editor\'s job at The New York Times for promoting the career of Jayson Blair, a black drug a,\'ict and fantasist who invented entire stories describing the hills of West Virginia from a saloon down the street in New York. But somehow Raines still imagines himself a media bigfoot who can pronounce on the State of Journalism, a one-man Pulitzer Prize panel. This is a little like a White House chef who poisoned an entire state-dinner crowd mounting a soapbox to lecture that the new chefs can\'t be trusted.  Of course, that soapbox must be provided first. So who would give this naked man a fig leaf of respectability? The Washington Post would.  The Posties awarded Raines their marquee venue   the Sunday Outlook section -- to denounce Fox News Channel and its owner Rupert Murdoch. Announcing this was tugging at his\'professional conscience\'(thus suggesting he has one), Raines demanded to know\'Why can\'t American journalists steeped in the traditional values of their profession be loud and candid about the fact that Murdoch does not belong to our team?\'Read more: http://newsbusters.org/blogs/brent-bozell/2010/03/16/bozell-column-fraud-fights-fox-news#ixzz0iPJT7cDM
Perfectly timed for the week President Barack Obama is pushing the House to vote on ObamaCare, on tonight\'s (Tuesday) episode of CBS\'s The Good Wife, set at a Chicago law firm, the lawyers \'battle a health insurance company that refuses to pay for urgent in-utero surgery.\' The CBS.com plug for the March 16 episode: \'In an emergency courtroom set up in a hospital, Alicia and Will battle Patti Nyholm and an insurance company that refuses to pay for life-saving in-utero surgery.\'  The last time I critiqued The Good Wife (\'CBS Drama Showcases Blank Book that Mocks Palin as Empty-Headed Dunce\'), NewsReal blog\'s David Forsmark contended the program \'is both politically and (more importantly) dramatically complex\' and deserves credit for showcasing liberal hypocrisy.  So, I\'ll hold out hope this episode will deliver more than just simplistic vilification of an insurance company and might, given the plot involves \'in-utero surgery,\' also forward pro-life perspectives. Watch and see.  Read more: http://newsbusters.org/blogs/brent-baker/2010/03/16/prime-time-cbs-drama-target-health-insurance-company#ixzz0iPO585aO
Halloween was so fun. Camden was Wolverine, AJ was a witch, Dilyn was a skeleton, and Austin and me went as the Beauty and the Beast. Guess who was who? lol. We started out going to bri\'s where she made the most amazing assortment of soups and the cutes little bread soup bowls that looked like pumpkins. Don and Vicci and Maretta and Madison. It was a lot of fun. we did a bit of trick or treating with Bridger, and Madison and then we went up to our neighborhood and went around the block, Camden and Aj about two houses were needing to go potty but they didn\'t want to leave their goal of getting candy so they did the potty dance as they waited at each door! haha! I tried to get a video on my phone but it was getting too dark and the people always opened the door right before i got it going... but it was dang funny! after we got home I hurried and got the kids bathed and Camden asked to hand out candy I think he was more excited about handing out candy than going to get candy! Camden would go look out the blinds and start hollering that the kids were coming then he\'d run and grab the candy bowl and stand in front of the door.... after about 5 seconds he would set the bowl down and run back to the blinds and peek out to see where the kids were at.... then run back to the door stand infront of the front door and again wait till they did the door bell! it was quite entertaining! at one point we got some\'bigger kids\'and Aj looks at them and says your a\'big kid\'haha! the boys started laughing and he said\'yup\'it was a good night and lots of fun!
California Dreamin turned out to be another California nightmare for Elliott Sadler and his 19 team. The buzz words were already flowing in pre-race and qualifying quotes, almost in an eerie foreshadowing of the Sunday to come.\'We have a lot of effort put into our front clips, front geometry, trying to get the front tires to work as efficient as we can. Some owners may be thinking its body, motors, rear clips, center cage .there are many things that you can work on. Right now we\'re really working on our front clips area, bump stop and front geometry stuff. As a team, we think that\'s where we need to be better. Right now, that\'s where the emphasis has been with winter testing so far.\'Listening via the greatness of PitCommand, it was pretty clear from the start that Sadler was not happy but it goes further than that.Lap 5 caution (rain)Sadler after five (really 4) short laps tells CC Kevin Buskirk that there is a problem with the front end by announcing that the 19 car is ‘a little snug in the mi,\'le and a  little snug back in the gas .and that the splitter seemed to be dragging a bit\', in the corners. After a small exchange that the 19 team finally figured out that the radios used need the ‘big antenna\' in order for Sadler to hear them (maybe the Best Buy Geek Squad should assist) another ‘track position\' pit strategy move instead of making an honest attempt to ‘fix\' an ill handling car, 2 tires and a half pound out of the right rear was the pit call. The 19 entered the pits running 25th, and took the green flag running 21st.Side note: This caution lasted over 15 laps and it was during this caution that Sadler was asking for the dreaded TRACKBAR change in order to give him some more ‘forward bite\'. Since the last pit stop, no green flag laps had been run, and Sadler is already ‘complaining\' about the car. Not that there is anything wrong with this, except for the ‘strategy\' 2 tire stop laps before. Why not simply make the changes, take four tires, lose a few positions , in the name of making the car better in  he long run? But I have been a broken record about this for almost a decade.Lap 35 scanner chat:Sadler tells Buskirk that the 19 is ‘still dragging the splitter on entry\', and is a ‘little free off\'. The 19 car is running 26th at this time.Lap 41 caution (rain): Sadler reinforces that the ‘splitter is still dragging too much on entry\' He goes a bit more in depth for his CC with ‘Front end is trying to work, its better than yesterday.\' And lastly again states he wants ‘a little more forward bite on exit\'. Buskirk quickly and commandly tells the 19 team to go up on all 4 tire pressures and to a,\' a ‘packer\'. (not sure which tire the bump stop was a,\'ed to though). Sadler a,\'ed that he didn\'t think it would need much, maybe a ‘1/16th\', not much more. The 19 enter the pits running 27th, and took the field running 39th. It was then decided after a nice suggestion by Brett Griffin that it might be a good idea to ‘top off\' because there were only two cars running behind the 19. After topping off, the 19 takes the green flag running 40th.
When Valve confirmed Mac support for Steam last week, I emailed the Joystiq team with the following claim:\'this is arguably the biggest gaming news on Mac OS ever.\'It seems Valve shares the sentiment, as the company\'s John Cook   director of Steam development at Valve   calls it\'the biggest event in Steam\'s history.\'He also answered some more of our questions via email, so read on!   Joystiq: Just to clarify, Steam users with games already purchased on Windows and that have Mac versions available will have those Mac versions accessible to them immediately in Steam, for no extra charge?  John Cook: This is supported by\'Steam Play.\'We are using this feature to provide cross-platform access to all Valve games to those who already own the PC version. We hope other developers and publishers will use it in the same way.   Some blogs have reported that Valve\'hates the Mac\'  From Gabe:\'So, they seem to think that they want to do gaming, but there\'s never any follow through on any of the things they say they\'re going to do. That makes it hard to be excited about doing games for their platforms.\'So, as a followup, was Apple involved in this endeavor at all? Did they provide any programming resources or platform-level assistance?  First, the statement that Gabe hates the Mac is erroneous. In fact, he worked on a 6Mhz Lisa running a Mac emulator in his first post-college job and is involved in the current Mac work on a daily basis. As for Apple, yes -- we\'ve been working with them on this project and we\'re looking forward to expanding that relationship as we launch Steam for the Mac.
On Tuesday\'s Situation Room, CNN\'s Jack Cafferty returned to targeting Nancy Pelosi, this time for endorsing the controversial\'Slaughter Solution\'to passing ObamaCare through the House of Representatives without a vote. Cafferty labeled the proposal\'beyond sleazy,\'and later flatly remarke,\'dThis reeks!\'The commentator even gave some rare kudos to House Republicans [audio clips from the segment available here].  Cafferty devoted his 5 pm Eastern hour commentary to Pelosi\'s support for the\'deem and pass\'procedural maneuver that Democratic Representative Louise Slaughter submitted as a possible way of getting the Senate version of health care\'reform\'passed through the House. He wasted little time in expressing his amazement at the move:\'Just when you think you\'ve seen it all in Washington, along comes something like this. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi may try to pass the controversial health care reform bill without making members vote on it- simply unbelievable.\'Story Continues Below Ad ?  Later, after using his\'beyond sleazy\'label, Cafferty ripped into the House Speaker and her Democratic colleagues, and commended their Republican opponents for speaking out against the so-called Slaughter Solution:\'Pelosi says of this process- quote, \'I like it, because people don\'t have to vote on the Senate bill,\' unquote. In Nancy Pelosi\'s world, accountability is a dirty word....This tactic has been used in the past, but never- never for something as big and important as the $900 billion health care reform bill- never. Republicans are jumping all over this, rightfully so. They\'re painting it as a way for Democrats to avoid taking responsibility, which is exactly what it is. Some even suggest it\'s unconstitutional.\'Near the end of the segment, anchor Wolf Blitzer remarke,\'dWe\'re earning a lot about reconciliation, about \'deeming\' bills passed into law. We\'re getting a little civics lesson out there, aren\'t we, Jack?\'The CNN commentator replie,\'dWe\'re learning a lot more about lack of political guts.\'When Blitzer retorted that\'that\'s been around for a while,\'Cafferty bluntly replie,\'dNot quite in this obnoxious form or noxious form.

Taylor Harris, a black University of Virginia graduate now studying writing at Johns Hopkins, had an excellent article (\'Racial pawns in the battle for same-sex marriage\') in the Washington Post recently.  \'All too often,\' she begins, white liberal classmates at the University of Virginia would ask, \'Shouldn\'t blacks, more than any other group, support gay rights?\' She continues:      I never understood my classmates\' need to align the historical struggles of blacks with those of homosexuals and then push their quadratic equation of oppression on me. Was not one point of Ralph Ellison\'s Invisible Man, a classic text for college seminars, that blacks deserve an existence free from an assigned role? That they should not be pawns in any social movement? And even if they hadn\'t read the book, wasn\'t it clear that stereotypical assumptions based on race are regressive?  On that last point, it\'s certainly not clear to everyone. What would there be to \'diversity,\' after all, without the assumption that blacks are one and all \'different\' enough to provide it to others? For the purposes of \'diversity,\' in short, blacks are fungible: because they are all \'different,\' they are all the same. But let\'s leave \'diversity\' aside for now and return to the issue of blacks and gays.  \'Hearing that from my white peers was one thing,\' Ms. Harris continued,      [b]ut last month, one of our greatest civil rights leaders also sang the same cacophonous tune in an attempt to peg African Americans\' morals and opinions to our socio-historical identities.
Joe Sheehan over at Basketball Prospectus is back aboard a favorite old hobbyhorse  of his — the NCAA selection committee\'s habit of matching up non-BCS schools in the first round — and damned if he doesn\'t have a point.  This year, we have UNLV-Northern Iowa, Butler-UTEP, Richmond-St. Mary\'s, Temple-Cornell. That\'s not an inordinate number of mid-major vs. mid-major pairings; if you were to randomly generate a bracket, as Kevin Pelton did, you\'d get four or five such games. But here\'s Sheehan:      The thing is, it\'s *not* a random process. They\'re sitting down, doing a bracket and shoving these teams together, while also giving us Cal/Louisville and Clemson/Missouri. I stand by the idea that this is intentional, and has increased since the Wichita State/George Mason regional semi in \'06. They simply don\'t want more than one, maybe two widely spaced Cinderellas getting to that second weekend.      Running at this from a different direction, follow the money. Conferences get shares based on how far their teams advance in the tournament. It\'s best for the dominant conferences if the smaller ones are capped in how many shares they can get.      [...]      It\'s bad for the tournament and for the game. Cornell, UTEP, St. Mary\'s, UNI...these teams can\'t get games against BCS schools in the regular season short of playing at their place, and sometimes not even then. The tournament should provide some of that opportunity, and it\'s aggressively not doing so, essentially protecting the scheduling practices of BCS schools by not potentially exposing them to quality lower-conference teams in the tournament.  There\'s a case to be made that just about any first-round matchup of mid-major teams is both somewhere south of ideal — fans don\'t want Cinderella vs. Cinderella — and easily avoided. That the selection committee feels otherwise, Sheehan argues, isn\'t so much a wicked conspiracy as it is the inevitably perverted outcome of letting people with skin in the game decide who gets to play whom and when. I\'ll buy that. For all the talk of\'peeling the onion\'and all the ludicrously pained efforts at objectivity (a reliance on that worthless bit of bottom-dealing known as the RPI, for instance), the selection process is in reality little more than an exercise in looking at the big blinking neon arrows all around you and doing exactly as they say.
Back during the 2008 presidential campaign, then-Sen. Joe Biden, the Democratic nominee for vice president said it was\'patriotic\'for people to pay more taxes, in an interview on ABC\'s\'Good Morning America.\'But what if you don\'t have to pay more taxes legally?  Biden\'s reasoning was simplistic - that we all need to\'jump in, time to be part of the deal, time to help get America out of the rut.\'But according to CNBC\'s Jim Cramer, based on legal precedence, the Internal Revenue Service encourages people to pay as little tax as possible, as long as it is within the boundaries of the seemingly endless U.S. tax code.\'The government has made it very clear in a series of tax rulings since the income tax started - and I learned this at law school - that it is actually well within your patriotic right to try and pay as little tax legally,\'Cramer said on CNBC\'s March 12\'Street Signs.\'See, tax avoidance is actually part of the IRS - says listen tax avoidance, you can do it. Tax evasion is against the law. Tax avoidance, the IRS has always said listen you have every right to try and have tax avoidance. And believe me, I\'m going to take advantage of it.\'Read more: http://newsbusters.org/blogs/jeff-poor/2010/03/12/biden-debunked-cramer-declares-avoiding-taxes-patriotic-duty#ixzz0iPLll5FX
Who would have ever thought that\'a bike\'would bring me onto such a positive & life changing path?  On 01 January 1994, I realized that there was more to life than: guzzling an expensive bottle of Robert Mondavi Chardonnay, being the belle of the ball, speaking of what others need to work on, and/or sitting daily on the same coach (in self pity). So, I bought a 10 year old Bianchi Road Bike. And I began a 6-month intense cycling training for a cycling event called the California AIDS Ride #2.  In May of 1994, I left San Francisco with $3.00 in my pocket, no idea of how I was going to return, a questionable bike, the fear of failure, and began to cycle (along with 1500 other cyclist) toward West Hollywood. Seven days, 575 miles later, I arrived in West Hollywood. At which point, I realized it is possible to step outside of your normal routine. I realized it is possible to empower yourself while assisting others. I realized that I wasn\'t alone in my ideas of creating a better world. And I realized that miracles could occur (after all, I made it back home with $3.00 in my pocket).
Facebook\'s f8 conference  is shaping up to have quite a few improvements in store for developers, and we think we\'ve come across another one: a change to Facebook\'s data retention policy. Yesterday, Facebook employee Monica Keller (who left MySpace to join  the company last month), took part in a conversation on Twitter that seemed to indicate that developers may no longer have to delete user data. The possible change came to light after Gnip CEO Eric Marcoullier gently chided Keller about developers being unable to store any user data, to which she responded, \'come to f8!\'.  Since that tweet, we\'ve heard further whispers about a change to Facebook\'s 24 hour policy retention, and that Facebook is already briefing developers on the upcoming changes.
Britain\'s small businesses are being offered free domain names and website hosting in a bid to get every plumber, window cleaner and green-grocer online. Up to 1.5 million of the UK\'s sole traders and micro-business owners don\'t have a web presence at the moment. The British government wants to do something about this, and they\'ve teamed up with Google and BT to solve what they perceive to be a problem. The result is an initiative called Getting British Business Online which has the bold ambition of getting 100,000 commercial websites running by the end of 2010. The core of the program is the GBBO \'wizard\' that makes it easy for a business owner to create a site in about 15 minutes. There are plans for PayPal to a,\' an e-commerce platform in the next couple of months. Subscribers to this free service get their own choice of a .co.uk domain name and two years of free hosting. The pages are built with Google sites, while BT offers free telephone support to allow users to\'create an effective online presence.\'In a,\'ition, the UK has launched a qualification called, ITQ for Doing Business Online, which is aimed at helping businesses get the most from their website, thus allowing them to become more competitive. According to the UK Secretary of State for Business, Lord Mandelson:\'Encouraging more businesses to seize the opportunities the internet offers is particularly important now that the economy is growing again.\'It remains to be seen whether Britain\'s army of offline entrepreneurs are tempted to start promoting their wares online through this offer of a free website.
Email messages obtained by the Competitive Enterprise Institute via a Freedom of Information Act request reveal that the climate dataset of NASA\'s Go,\'ard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) was considered — by the top climate scientists within NASA itself — to be inferior to the data maintained by the University of East Anglia Climate Research Unit (CRU).  The NASA scientists also felt that NASA GISS data was inferior to the National Climate Data Center Global Historical Climate Network (NCDC GHCN) database.  These emails, obtained by Christopher Horner, also show that the NASA GISS dataset was not independent of CRU data.  Further, all of this information regarding the accuracy and independence of NASA GISS data was directly communicated to a reporter from USA Today in August 2007.  The reporter never published it.  —————————————
When Sen. Evan Bayh of Indiana announced last week he wasn\'t running for re-election, he didn\'t state what may have seemed obvious. He couldn\'t say he wanted to avoid the embarrassment of losing, or that he worried he\'d never achieve national office if that happened. Instead, he launched into a lecture about what was wrong with everyone else. The government is\'dysfunctional\'with\'brain-dead partisanship.\'It\'s\'Groundhog Day.\'This scenario repeats itself every time the Democrats take control.  Bayh\'s bleats hardened quickly into the media\'s conventional wisdom. Why can\'t the politicians hold hands in a Kumbaya circle and get\'something\'done? Translation: when Obama and a Democrat-dominated Congress can\'t nationalize the health-care system and force everyone to drive a Prius, su,\'enly government is\'dysfunctional.\'When gridlock is holding up the liberals\' agenda, Washington should know\'the people\'sent them to pass massive ultraliberal bills. Story Continues Below Ad ?  These media mathematicians clearly have thrown their polling calculators out the window. When Newsweek recently asked independents if they supported the Democrat health proposals, 26 percent were in favor, and 62 percent were opposed. But the\'wisdom\'in town says Democrats must pass these health bills or get crushed in November. Now who can\'t seem to acknowledge, to borrow from Stephen Colbert, that\'reality has a conservative bias\'?  Reality tells you many Democrats are political toast, thanks to ObamaCare. Hence, bye-bye Bayh. But our journalists put on their choir robes and continue to sing the sad song in unison: Why do we have a\'Broken Government\'? CNN actually launched an entire series of reports with that title.  Read more: http://newsbusters.org/blogs/brent-bozell/2010/02/23/bozell-column-broken-government-when-liberals-lose#ixzz0iPKL7Ltc
Maybe Thomson Reuters was feeling nostalgic about the flurry of negative attention that both the New York Times and the Washington Post got last year when they came out with policies on the use of social media tools such as Twitter and Facebook. For whatever reason, the wire service recently issued new guidelines for its staff, and they suffer from many of the same problems that both the NYT and WaPo policies did. All of these flaws boil down to one thing: A desire to control something that fundamentally can\'t be controlled, and a fear of what happens when that control is lost. Without even bothering to enumerate the positive aspects of social media use, the policy starts in with the warnings right away:      We want to encourage you to use social media approaches in your journalism but we also need to make sure that you are fully aware of the risks — especially those that threaten our hard-earned reputation for independence and freedom from bias or our brand.  The risks, of course, are everywhere — someone might say something embarrassing, or post a tweet that others could twist to disparage Reuters:      The advent of social media does not change your relationship with the company that employs you — do not use social media to embarrass or disparage Thomson Reuters. Our company\'s brands are important; so, too, is your personal brand. Think carefully about how what you do reflects upon you as a professional and upon us as an employer of professionals.
Recently Presidential Special Advisor David Axelrod has been painted as a beleaguered figure, upset at the world he sees around him. Today he told the Republicans to\'make my day\'and the Israelis a new policy announcement was an\'insult.\'Axelrod and White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs were doing the rounds on the Sunday talk shows to talk about healthcare reform, among other topics. Gibbs told Fox News Sunday that Democrats would have enough votes to pass the bill in the next week or so and that soon we wouldn\'t be\'talking about health care as a proposal, but as the law of the land.\'Tom Brokaw, on Meet the Press, asked David Axelrod about the political cost of that reform for upcoming elections. Axelrod leapt up on the table, and began savagely beating him (metaphorically):      If the Republican Party wants to go out and say to that child who now has insurance or say to that small business that will get tax credits this year if he signs the bill to help their employees get health care. If they want to say to them,\'You know what? We\'re actually gonna take that away from you. We don\'t think that\'s such a good idea.\'I say, let\'s have that fight. Make my day. I\'m ready to have that. And every member of Congress ought to be willing to have that debate as well.  Enough ass-kicking work for one day? Not for fuck-you-Axelrod. Israel have potentially torpedoed delicate negotiations with Palestine by announcing a plan to build 1600 new homes in Jerusalem. He told ABC\'s This Week that the move was both an\'affront\'and an\'insult.
We see this when He demands of us the impossible. Jesus told people to\'go and sin no more.\'(Jn. 5:14, 8:11) Not, go and sin less. Sin no more. Impossible.\'Husbands, love your wives as Christ loved the church.\'(Eph. 5:25)\'Be perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect.\'(Matt. 5:48) God asks of us the impossible, we fail, we sin - we separate from God because we can\'t do the impossible.   But God can. All things, it says in Matthew 19 when speaking of salvation (something impossible for us to achieve on our own), are possible with God.  The Bible starts with this very thing: In the beginning God created. God was there when time began and created. How? By the impossible task of creation through speaking. I can\'t get my daughters to turn off the lights in their room with my words, but God sai,\'dlet there be light.\'AND THERE WAS LIGHT! Not just a 50w bulb here; there was LIGHT. From His voice! The Psalmist says God breathed out stars and gathers the waters of the seas into jars. (Ps. 33:6-7) And this is just the start. God is so big he deals in the realm of the impossible.  And so it\'s no surprise that Christmas is an impossible night. Let\'s turn to John 1, starting in verse 10:  He was in the world, and though the world was made through him, the world did not recognize him. He came to that which was his own, but his own did not receive him. Yet to all who received him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God— children born not of natural descent, nor of human decision or a husband\'s will, but born of God.   The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the One and Only, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth.  Impossibly, God the creator entered into His creation at Christmas (well, technically, at Jesus\' conception.) The world was made through him (Jesus), and He became flesh and made his dwelling among us. As our pastor, Jason, reminded us this morning [12/20 sermon], God did not just drop in for a visit. He was born into our world. He became one of us. God became a man: impossible. He was born to a virgin. Impossible. He came that we might be saved. Impossible.  Impossible for man, but with God all things are possible. Angels appeared to shepherds. Angels appeared to Mary & Joseph. Sages from far away read Jesus\' birth in the stars. The creator God of the universe who is big enough to breathe out stars became a baby, wrapped in laid in the humblest of mangers. Proclaimed by angels, worshipped by shepherds and foreigners - Jesus entered His creation, became Immanuel: God with us. He made it possible for us to become born again, something which again is impossible - without God. A little baby displayed the glory of God. The smallest of infants demonstrated, through His impossible birth and through the bigness of who this baby was, the immensity of God\'s grace, His mercy, His love.  This is why Christmas is a reason to worship, to celebrate, to be in awe of this GREAT BIG GOD who came for us who deals in the (what is for us) impossible in impossible ways   that\'s the message of Christmas and it\'s what we rejoice in at Christmas.
It\'s been something of a long road to this point (beginning with the company being founded by some laid off OpenMoko employees), but Qi Hardware\'s ultra-compact, open source Ben NanoNote (actually, ? NanoNote) is now shipping for just $99. That will get you a bare bones device that can simply be used as a Linux-based\'handheld laptop\'out of the box or, as the company hopes, be turned into anything from a PMP to an offline Wikipedia device. Something along those lines would seem to be the most practical, considering the device only has a 3-inch 320 x 240 display, along with some similarly basic specs including a 336 MHz XBurst Jz4720 CPU, 32MB of RAM, 2GB of flash storage, and a microSD card slot for expansion. Head on past the break for a look under the lid.
Some days later, Alessandro shared this interesting post about the several versions of Flash available on Android.It\'s now clear that a new Flash Lite is coming \'soon\'. What is it (apart to support AS3, alleluia) ? For which platform ? Available throught CS4 or CS5  Like I reported previously, it\'s strange how Adobe isn\'t sharing the information on FLite 4.0...Perhaps to avoid the confusion with FP10.1 ? I only hope one thing : to see FL4 (and FP10.1) working on Android emulator! Actually, apart an old S60 SDK which let you play FL1.1, I never found an emulator (nokia, se, android,...) able to play FL files and no, unfortunatly, the HTC Desire ROM doesn\'t work on Android emulator, since it\'s not for the right ARM processor :(
With despair gripping New York Democrats over ethical scandals claiming Governor David Patterson, Rep. Charlie Rangel (D-NY), and Rep. Eric Massa (D-NY), New York\'s Attorney General Andrew Cuomo cuts a heroic figure as the presumptive heir to the governorship.  But catching up with Cuomo is his relationship with the mortgage meltdown that nearly destroyed the American economy. Appointed by Bill Clinton as secretary of the U.S. Department for Housing and Urban Development (HUD), Andrew Cuomo has been called \'the father of the subprime crisis\' for the policies he orchestrated.  It was Cuomo\'s directives that mandated HUD to vastly increase the amount of risky home loans bought by quasi-governmental housing giants Fannie Mae and Fre,\'ie Mac. Now, Cuomo may be haunted by his tenure as HUD secretary, where he planted the seeds for the nation\'s housing collapse.  Though America\'s financial fortunes suffered after Cuomo\'s time at HUD, his own personal fortune soared. The bulk of this financial \'windfall\' came courtesy of Andrew Farkas, the billionaire real estate developer who helped Cuomo amass his wealth as a business partner and campaign fundraiser. Farkas — now Cuomo\'s financial chairman as he circles the governorship — has personally given Cuomo at least $1.8 million in cash.
riginally posted this a couple weeks ago after the link was forwarded to me, but rewrote my thoughts after seeing it a few times.  I\'ll still watch it again. A few times are not enough for me. Each time you watch you\'ll see another inspiring moment. Sometimes I just want to quit work and practice, so I can join the fun.  (Many of my best articles start with ideas from readers like you, so please keep sending me your thoughts!!!)  This documentary is not new, but totally worth your time.    It\'s interesting watching these young ballet dancers grow into Flamenco dancers. The clapping exercises, the timing, and the process they go through are amazing. Few of us could be that good without their background, but it\'s still worth checking out even if you\'re a casual dancer.  It\'s very inspirational. They start so\'simple\'and build!  The passion from the instructors is obvious. They clearly know the history and story behind the music and movements. They combine amazing technique with an understanding of the feel, providing depth behind the movements.  You have to love the\'circle\'concept (around 26 minutes), where individuals take a turn dancing solo while everybody else provides the rhythm foundation and support. Hip-hop dancers do this all the time, but obviously it\'s been around a few centuries before they were born. (As they say, little is truly new. Most great artists build on the shoulders of the giants before them...)  Obviously this passion is way beyond what most of us will do social dancing. When you see the results from lots of hard work it may inspire you to work a little harder so you can join the fun too.  Great dance has it\'s moments of intense work. When it all comes together in the end it\'s a beautiful, inspiring, sensual experience.It\'s hard not to smile and feel good watching them perform.  Special thinks to Valentine Doran for turning me on to this clip.  Let me know what you think!   More details:
Word from Apple is out -- so get your credit cards ready. The iPad will be launching on Saturday April 3rd (and on the shelves, er... display tables at Apple retail stores), but you\'ll be able to plunk down cold, hard cash for it in just a week. Pre-orders will begin on March 12th for the US version (non-3G) for that April street date, with the 3G version coming in late April along with iPads for eager buyers in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Spain, Switzerland and the UK.

In sports, everyone is a winner—some people just win better than others. Like Michael David Barrett, Erin Andrews\'s peeper, who was sentenced yesterday to two-and-a-half years in prison and life as another triple-named American villain.  Maybe some J.D. out there (or, that failing, an ESPN.com commenter) can explain this to me. U.S. District Judge Manuel Real said the 30 months was the maximum he could\'ve imposed, though a quick glance at the federal sentencing table would suggest that Barrett\'s term actually falls toward the low end. (Stalking carries a base offense level of 18, i.e. 27-33 months, though the fact that Barrett chased Andrews all across the Marriotts of America probably should\'ve taken it up a couple of ticks). In any case, Andrews is not pleased:\'I\'m at the angry stage right now,\'the ESPN reporter and upcoming contestant on ABC\'s\'Dancing With the Stars\'said outside court.\'I\'m mad. Thirty months is not enough.\'[...]      She blasted Barrett for claiming he should get leniency because he\'s paying for his guilty plea with public humiliation and spoke searingly in court about her own fear and suffering.\'Let\'s talk about public humiliation, Mr. Barrett,\'Andrews said.\'I\'m living public humiliation. The picture on the Internet is mine, it\'s not his.
CNN received two awards on March 13 from the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) during its annual GLAAD Media Awards. The American Morning program received the\'outstanding TV journalism segment\'award for an interview of a child who refuses to say the Pledge of Allegiance until homosexuals have\'equal rights,\'while Joy Behar received their\'excellence in media\'award for her HLN program.  The homosexual activist organization\'s press release on the awards revealed that\'CNN\'s American Morning producer Beth Marengo and Will Phillips accepted for the Outstanding TV Journalism Segment, \'Why Will Won\'t Pledge Allegiance\' which featured Phillips and his father. In a rousing speech that elicited a standing ovation, 11-year-old Phillips said: \'I know there are certain political restraints that make action difficult, however lack of equality for some is lack of equality for all and I think its time for us all to get equal.\'Story Continues Below Ad ?  Anchor John Roberts interviewed Phillips and his father on the November 16, 2009 edition of American Morning. As NewsBuster Noel Sheppard pointed out, the two were given much better treatment than tea party protesters were given earlier in 2009.  Behar received her\'excellence\'award from NBC Today show anchor Meredith Vieira. The GLAAD press released trumpeted how the HLN host\'has shown a strong commitment to educating the public about the lives of gay and transgender people.\'The TVNewser blog on March 14 reported Behar\'s beyond positive reaction to the recognition:\'I\'d rather have that than the Oscar...It shows that people who struggle in this society with public image and being behind the eight ball with their rights, they recognize that someone like me who has the microphone can support them.
Hear ye, hear ye! I doth proclaim myself a full-fledged (or as close as I can be) adult. I\'ve schooled. I\'ve worked. I\'ve lived. I\'ve toiled. I am a fully-fledged adult. I\'ve taken on responsibility. I\'ve buckled down when the times required me to. I\'ve been the epitome of Emily Post\'s great-great-grandchild. Yes, I am a full-fledged adult. I may now proceed onto bigger and better things. I am an adult who is comfortable in their own Chupa Chups skin. I\'m as honest as can be. I feel really guilty lying to people, but I\'m not one to shy away from a little white lie; you know, like the few times a homeless person comes up to you and asks you for change and you say you don\'t have any. I mean don\'t get me wrong. I give up my change if I have it. However, if I\'m not in the best financial situations, I\'m most certainly not going to give up my laundry money quarter to a stranger who\'s probably making good on loose change. If I can\'t afford to give coins, I do my best to offer whatever food I may have. (Haven\'t you noticed that although they say they want something to eat, they\'d rather get the cash instead?) So, yes, I am a fully-fledged adult. I practice good hygiene. In the winter, I shower, floss, brush, and rinse at least twice a day; morning and night. When summer time arrives, it\'s at least three times. I commit to nourishing my body with healthy foods. I\'ve just taught myself to eat celery. I\'m not 100% there but I\'m a good 40% there. I\'ve taught myself to eat spinach, broccoli, bean curd, tofu, etc. Yes, I am a fully-fledged adult. Sadly, as this fully-fledged adult, my metabolism isn\'t the best. It\'s increasingly slowing down. It\'s harder for me to manage my weight. Although I\'ve not gained much weight, I\'ve also not been able to lose any; mostly because I forget the most important part of the component of weight loss- actually get up off the couch. Sigh. SO to the world: I doth proclaim my adultness. I am one of you. I\'ve joined your ranks. I\'m a doer and not just a follower. World, that is all. Please continue with your day. Goodbye.
Being busy with a lot of open projects at work and school has made me a bit tired. I get off work and have to go to school. I finish an exam at school and I have to deal with a tight deadline at work. Sometimes, I want to \'pause\' what\'s going on around me and go and walk for couple of hours. I need to get my thoughts organized and defragged. I feel a subtle touch of fear in missing deadlines or missing important tasks. I\'m always repeating/reviewing my Todo\'s list in an effort to prevent any missed task. I hope I can stretch my mind over all these tasks and get to a level where I can handle Multi- Multi -tasking .  As Oliver Wendell Holmes puts: A mind that is stretched by a new experience can never go back to its old dimension
Does life behind the mouthpiece sometimes feel like there\'s a camera on the front of your bell, and you\'re on a high speed bobsled going ninety miles an hour? All the notes are flying by faster than they can be processed. We\'re on a race desperately trying to maintain control, dropping more notes than we nail. Is this a trumpet or a runaway Toyota? Somebody help!  Remember what Dad did when the family would get lost on vacation trips? He drove faster! Why is it that the harder the passage, the faster we go? Instead of the panic button, we should hit the brakes. With treacherous curves at every turn, cooler heads and slower practice speeds ought to prevail.  Dr. Phil has a two-word remedy for this ailment: SLOW DOWN! Everything improves at slower speeds. Notes can be seen, heard and controlled much better in slow motion. Think paycheck. You only get paid for well-played notes, period. Why not perfect as many notes as you can at your own comfortable tempo? High speeds may be resumed when conditions are safe.

A recent article gave an interesting look into exorcism as practiced within the Roman Catholic Church. According to Father Gabriele Amorth, the Vatican\'s chief exorcist, the unfortunate sex abuse scandals in the Catholic Church is proof that\'the Devil is at work inside the Vatican.\'Astonishingly, Father Amorth indicated that he participated in around 70,000 exorcisms during his 25 years as a Catholic exorcist. For any of you who are counting, that\'s a claim of approximately 7.5 exorcisms per day, for the last 25 years!  While Father Amorth\'s description of satanic possession seems quite graphic, from at least one personal experience I can affirm that a good portion of it is fairly accurate. I previously wrote about Satan\'s power and influence in a related post.  Without delving into the controversial sex abuse scandals or trying to figure out how Father Amorth has time to sleep or eat with his busy exorcist schedule, I\'d like to discuss priesthood authority and its connection to rejecting satanic presence. Particularly, is Christ\'s true priesthood required to command Satan and his subjects? Can the faith of an individual (or the combined faith of those present) be used in an exorcism instead of invoking or wielding the true priesthood authority?  The apostle John once remarked to the Savior that\'[the apostles] saw one casting out devils in thy name; and we forbad him, because he followeth not with us. And Jesus said unto him, Forbid him not: for he that is not against us is for us\'(Luke 9:49-50)(emphasis a,\'ed).  Does this mean that those without Christ\'s true priesthood authority are able to command and cast out devils as much as one with authority? Commenting on the phrase\'he followeth not us,\'Elder Bruce R. McConkie wrote:\'He was not one of the Twelve to whom the express power had been given to cast out devils (Matthew 10:8); he was not one of the inner circle of disciples who traveled, ate, slept, and communed with the Master. Luke has it: \'He followeth not with us\'; that is, he is not one of our traveling companions. But from our Lord\'s reply it is evident that he was a member of the kingdom, a legal administrator who was acting in the authority of the priesthood and the power of faith. Either he was unknown to John who therefore erroneously supposed him to be without authority or else John falsely supposed that the power to cast out devils was limited to the Twelve and did not extend to all faithful priesthood holders. It is quite possible that the one casting out devils was a seventy. ...\'Only righteous men who are members of the Church, who hold the priesthood, and who are keeping the commandments, have power to perform miracles.... Our Lord had many faithful followers who had power by faith to cast out devils\'(Doctrinal New Testament Commentary, 1:417)(emphasis a,\'ed).  To be clear, I do not believe the Catholic Church wields the true priesthood of God. Consistent with LDS theology, I believe Christ\'s true priesthood was lost to the world at large during the great apostasy. However, I also do not believe that Catholic exorcists, such as Father Amorth are followers of Satan. (See Matt. 12:25-26) Notwithstanding, is it possible that exorcisms can still be effectuated by individuals lacking the priesthood through an exercise and display of faith?  The Prophet Joseph Smith taught that\'faith is not only the principle of action, but of power also, in all intelligent beings, whether in heaven or on earth\'(Lectures on Faith, 1:13)(emphasis a,\'ed). Indeed, it was faith that was invoked to frame the worlds (Heb 11:3), and it is through faith that all created things exist.\'[Faith] is the principle by which Jehovah works, and through which he exercises power over all temporal as well as eternal things.... And if the principle of power, it must be so in man as well as in Diety\'(Id. at 1:16, 18)(emphasis a,\'ed).  When the Twelve were unable to cast a devil out of a\'lunatick,\'they queried the Savior on how He was able to finish what they could not. Christ then proceeded to teach them doctrines of faith, not of priesthoods.\'Because of your unbelief: for verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you. Howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting\'(Matt. 17:20-21)(emphasis a,\'ed). Thus, since prayer and fasting doesn\'t have any effect on whether one possesses the priesthood but instead affects one\'s level of faith, it appears that exorcism relies more on the principle of faith than on one\'s authority.  Admittedly, I have not taken part in or seen a Catholic exorcism (apart from what Hollywood concocts). I have, however, taken part in a handful of LDS exorcisms and can attest that one\'s faith plays an enormous role. Still, I am not certain of the extent that God\'s priesthood plays in such instances. Is the pristhood required simply to keep order? Yet, if an individual lacks the priesthood but has sufficient faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, can that individual command evil in His name? And, if that is the case, does Father Amorth truly exorcise evil spirits during his claimed frequent encounters?
Each time Andrew Sullivan writes negatively about Israel (which is to say, almost every day), my e-mail in-box becomes flooded with pleas that I respond. Sometimes I don\'t, because I have other, better things, to do. But last week, after Andrew published an egregious and tendentious map meant to deny Jewish claims to virtually any of the land of Israel, I did respond, helped along by about 130 e-mails from readers who were as upset as I was that the Atlantic Magazine\'s website featured such crude agitprop. I responded quickly, and angrily (even making a mistake in accusing Andrew of not attributing the map. He did, to the anti-Israel academic Juan Cole.) Then, of course, Andrew responded quickly and angrily, and I spent a good deal of time thinking of ways to respond to his response to my response. And then I realized that this is not how I want to spend my life.  Yes, it\'s upsetting that Andrew Sullivan, a man of obvious intellectual gifts (and someone for whom I retain great personal fondness), has become an anti-Israel propagandist. But it\'s not my job to counter everything he says. He\'s not particularly interested in hearing fact-based arguments that undermine whatever argument he happens to be making, in any case. And even if he did care, it\'s not in the best interests of The Atlantic, or of my journalism, or my sanity, to spend my time worrying about Andrew\'s ever-shifting views on the Mi,\'le East.  So I\'m unilaterally disengaging from this struggle. I pray, of course, that Andrew comes to see that his oversimplification of Mi,\'le East history and politics has caused real damage to real people, but it\'s time for someone else to argue with him.  There is another benefit to disengagement. As Goldblog readers know, I\'m deeply distressed by many currents in Israeli society and politics, the continuing, disproportionate power of the settlement movement being chief among my concerns. But I find myself hesitant to criticize Israel these days because my words are inevitably used by people who don\'t have Israel\'s best interests, or the best interests of American Jews, at heart.  So I want to find a new way to write about these issues. The new way, obviously, is the old way. The best use of my time, I think, would be to return to what I originally was meant to do when I joined The Atlantic a couple of years ago, which is to write reported, carefully considered, fact-checked and closely-edited articles about the issues that interest me. In other words, don\'t expect to see too much on Goldblog about this set of issues, generally. I appreciate all of your letters (except those that begin\'Dear Zionist Douchebag,\'or,\'Dear Self-Hating Jewboy Douchebag\'), and I\'ll figure out, as I go forward, what to do with this blog, but I don\'t think that writing in anger is good for anyone. So here\'s hoping that the Goldblog Unilateral Disengagement Plan goes better than the Gaza Disengagement Plan.
Note:  My apologies for the prior version of this post.  I wrote it too quickly and did not give it a good proof reading.  I read an article the other day by Arthur Langer about how IT can survive the current economic recession.  I was struck by the following piece of advice:  \'Move more IT expenses into business units.  This keeps all the dollars from being in one large IT budget.  It also allows business units to defend their requests for extra spending.\'  I read this recommendation a few times.  Langer\'s other advice, shown below, makes sense.  The points below are sound.      * Show why investments need to precede—not lag—the recovery.  Give historical proof that this method works and timelines that will better position the business to compete.     * Ask for smaller amounts of investments, allowing the business to be somewhat cautious should economic trends not improve.     * Don\'t expect the budget you might ultimately need, but rather the dollars that will allow you to deliver some portion of the overall product strategy.     * Commit to product reviews, perhaps every 90 days.  This way, executives can feel that they can change priorities if and when necessary.  The idea of moving (hiding) IT expenses in the business unit to make them small enough not to be noticed seems out of place in this list.
This is a longer version of a story that will appear in the Sunday Calendar section of the Los Angeles Times and also on the cover of Brand X.  Bryan Singer and Lauren Shuler Donner  Through the years, comic-book films took audiences to all the predictable places, including the grim streets of Gotham City and the doomed spires of planet Krypton, but, a decade ago, a new type of comic-book film had the audacity to set its opening sequence in a truly unexpected place -- the gates of Auschwitz, where Jewish families were bring marched through mud on their way to death and despair.  From those first moments,\'X-Men\'set itself apart from the entire Hollywood history of comic-book adaptations and marked the beginning of this current era of fanboy cinema, which has dominated the box office and elevated San Diego\'s Comic-Con International into something resembling a Cannes for capes.\'The opening, it really was a declaration of intent,\'producer Lauren Shuler Donner said of that sequence, which showed a terrified young boy exhibiting mutant powers as his family was separated by German guards.\'It said to the audience this is a serious film, grounded in the realistic and the historic and somewhat dark. It was so smart. And it was all totally Bryan.\'That would be Bryan Singer, the director of\'X-Men\'and its first sequel, who was sitting next to Shuler Donner in her office on a recent afternoon. The pair both had big smiles on their faces -- they had been reunited by an invitation to reminisce about the legacy of the July 2000 release, which they were happy to do, but the conversation kept veering into gi,\'y plans for the future. Singer is returning to the\'X-Men\'universe, it\'s clear now, for a project called\'X-Men: First Class\'; it\'s all just a matter of timing.

A Northwest Side man listed as a potential threat to judges tried to enter the Daley Center with four hunting knives he had just purchased, according to the Cook County sheriff\'s office.  Kevin J. Long, 48, of the 4500 block of North Milwaukee Avenue, walked into the building Tuesday afternoon and passed through a metal detector while his bag was sent through an X-ray machine.  A Cook County sheriff\'s deputy saw images of several knives in Long\'s briefcase. When asked what was inside, Long allegedly said it was\'just papers,\'according to a news release from the sheriff\'s office.  Long allegedly told investigators he had come to the Daley Center to visit the law library and had forgotten about the knives, which he said he bought earlier in the day as a gift for his brother-in-law. He was charged with unlawful use of a weapon and unlawful use of a weapon by a felon, both of which are felonies.  Long has been on parole since November after serving 15 months in prison for telling a witness in a civil case that he would kill the witness\'s child. His name also is on a list developed by the U.S. Marshals Service and the Cook County sheriff\'s department naming individuals who may pose a threat to judges or court officials.  Long also has been arrested 18 times since 2000 for various incidents, including being caught in a judge\'s chambers and public indecency.  Cook County Circuit Judge Donald Panarese set bail at $350,000 on Wednesday, according to Tandra Simonton, spokeswoman for the Cook County state\'s attorney\'s office.  He was denied bail on the parole violation, and Panarese barred him from entering any Cook County courthouse unless he was required to be there and unless he was accompanied to and from the courtroom by a sheriff\'s deputy, Simonton said.
Always good to see hospitality-industry facilities that are in touch with local history and heritage. In its previous incarnation, as the mere Shattuck Hotel, this venerable establishment had become somewhat seedy. This is the first time I had seen it since its re-opening and re-branding last year. You can still tell that it was built in 1910, but (mainly) in a good way. Peace! In-flight video at the site. Place your order here. Expected cost\'will be about the same as a high-end motorcycle or car,\'according to the FAQs. I know this routine! When rationalizing buying a small airplane to my family, I avoided referring to\'dollars\'and instead tried to get away with the luxury-car counting-unit too. The FAQ list also includes, What happens if the engine stops? The answer involves a parachute.  2) Courtesy of USA Today, a sane statement from a TSA official! The TSA\'s John Sammon, referring to possible changes in policy in light of the terrorist crash of a small airplane into the IRS office in Austin last month, said:\'It may simply be a confirmation that for very small planes you\'re not going to see a lot of casualties.\'Obviously even one casualty is too many; obviously too, anti-IRS and anti-institutional violence of any sort is no joke.  But to be sustainable, a security policy must make sensible tradeoffs of risks and rewards; in a free society, it must also reflect a sensible long-term balance between security and liberty. You could entirely eliminate the risk of airplane hijackings or bombs if you didn\'t let anyone fly; you could entirely eliminate gun deaths if there were no guns; no risk of car bombs if there were not cars; etc. Panglossian that I am, I will take Mr. Sammon\'s comment as the dawn of a new age of sensible balance coming out of the TSA. 3) Courtesy of The Guardian, news that DARPA, the Pentagon\'s advanced-research body, is close to tests of a scheme to make jet fuel out of algae. This has obvious advantages over making jet fuel out of crude oil from petro-dictatorships. It has a less obvious advantage, which is that algae absorb about as much carbon when growing as their fuel releases when burned, for a much lower net-carbon impact. And unlike the benighted ethanol-subsidy program -- winner of a\'stupidest policy ever\'contest -- growing algae doesn\'t compete with growing crops for food. I hope this turns out to be feasible. 4) What the hell: courtesy of Crunch Gear and Sky News, let\'s wind up with another New Zealand candidate for\'interesting\'ways to fly. It\'s a home-built flying hovercraft. I can\'t embed the three-minute video, but it is worth going to the site to watch. The young woman reporter who takes a ride on this thing is lot more risk-tolerant than I have ever been, in either my reporting or my aviating life. Or perhaps more naively trusting. Either way, she ends up having an unexpectedly dangerous exciting ride.  More on the story here, including a shorter video that doesn\'t include the dramatic last minute.
I am pleased to announce that Salvatore Sanfilippo, the key developer for Redis, has decided to join the VMware engineering team. Redis is a high performance and scalable advanced key-value store where values can be data structures such as lists, sets, and hashmaps, as well as strings and blobs. Redis supports atomic operations on these data structures, allowing extremely high performance with consistent state to many client applications.  As VMware continues its investments in the context of cloud computing, technologies such as Redis become key for future cloud based apps, whether private or public cloud, and the cloud infrastructure itself. Large scale systems benefit greatly when there are alternatives to storing state within a centralized relational store (RDBMS). Many Redis customers have already experienced the tremendous benefit of storing select pieces of data within Redis for fast access, customized layout and access patterns. Some have used Redis exclusively, forgoing a relational database all together, since Redis offers several ways to persist the data it manages.  As cloud computing continues to push the bounds of how we define a cloud application, many exciting and new technologies will join the relational database as a means to store and retrieve data. Cloud based infrastructure itself has led the way in this regard, pushing the envelope for scale, performance, and access to large distributed data. This is most evident in Google\'s App Engine, utilizing several pieces of key technologies like BigTable to store data at scale.
As the company credited with practically inventing the Netbook category, it\'s no surprise Asus makes some of the most popular mini notebooks around. Top among these is the Eee PC 1005 series. Combining low (but not the lowest) prices with great battery life and good overall design, the 1005 has become the Netbook reference design for the entire industry.  The newest version, the $379 Eee PC 1005PE, is the first Netbook to reach our labs with Intel\'s new Atom N450 processor--the long-awaited sequel to the Atom N270 and N280 CPUs found in nearly every other Netbook.  This new 1005 model, thanks to the re-engineered Atom platform, is extremely efficient, and ran for more than 8 hours on our grueling battery drain test. That\'s extremely impressive, although the N450 was more of a mixed bag in our performance tests, beating other Netbooks in some categories, but matching or falling slightly behind in others.  Beyond that, the 1005PE eschews most of the recent trends in Netbook design, sticking with a 10-inch 1,024x600 pixel display, 1GB of RAM, and Windows 7 Starter. We\'ve become accustomed to the high-def 1,366x768 pixel resolution screens found on 11-, 12-, and even some 10-inch Netbooks, so this lower resolution feels cramped and dated in comparison. Nvidia\'s Ion GPU is also becoming a go-to part for upscale Netbooks, but is not included here.  The Eee PC 1005PE definitely scores points for being the first laptop out of the gate with the new N450 CPU, and its battery life is nothing short of amazing--making this a very useful system for serious road warriors. But we would have liked to see a 1005 that was more fully upgraded across the board.
From China, Wei, 27, is a software programming student at the Illinois Institute of Technology and hopes to become a computer financial analyst. He is in Chicago on a student visa.\'There is a big future for financial programming,\'Wei said about his plans, sitting inside a modest Bridgeport apartment he shares with his wife and recently born son.\'Not many people know how to do this work, or want to.\'For Wei\'s 44-year-old half-brother, life in the U.S. has not been so bright.  Fleeing poverty, the brother arrived illegally from China nine years ago. After a harrowing trip orchestrated by\'snakehead\'smugglers, he has toiled 14-hour days for sub-minimum wages inside Chicago restaurants.\'His life here has been a kind of torture,\'Wei said.  Immigrant advocates hope Sunday\'s march will pressure President Barack Obama and federal lawmakers into taking up their demands for comprehensive reforms in the coming months. They argue that problems with the nation\'s immigration system have festered long enough -- with ongoing deportations hurting families and a booming black market in fake IDs threatening national security.  Groups in favor of tougher enforcement of immigration laws, meanwhile, have used the march plans to rally their supporters. Roy Beck, president of the Virginia-based NumbersUSA group, described Sunday\'s march as\'the opening kickoff\'in any renewed immigration debate in Washington.  On Thursday, Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., outlined a new bill that is the latest effort in a campaign for proposals that have been defeated twice in recent years.  Among other things, the new bill calls for biometric Social Security cards and for requiring illegal immigrants to pay fines and perform community service before they\'re allowed a chance at lawful permanent residency. Obama issued a statement on Thursday pledging to get such immigration legislation moving through Congress this year.  Immigrant advocates said they were encouraged by Obama\'s remarks, but express frustration that the president has not fulfilled a promise to act on immigration reform earlier.\'We need to see action,\'said Joshua Hoyt, executive director of the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights.  John Darger said he has seen some of that anger in Crystal Lake, so he also plans to be on his way to Washington.  A teacher of English as a second language at McHenry County Community College, he cited stories from his Latino students about routine physical or verbal attacks, and resentful comments he\'s heard about newcomers from his neighbors.\'The country needs to move beyond this divide,\'he said.  Up to 6,000 area residents left Saturday on the roughly 120 charted buses for Washington, at least half departing in a caravan from an evening rally outside U.S. Cellular Field. The turnout was the result of a weeks-long scramble for funds by immigrant activists and religious groups.  Marilyn Navarro, 16, raised the $183 it took to get a bus seat for herself and a 25-year-old cousin by putting out a donation jar inside her parents\' Pilsen restaurant.  Navarro was inspired to go because her cousin arrived illegally with his parents as an 11-year-old.\'It makes me so sad to know that there are millions of people out there like him,\'she said.
It takes a little extra work to get in touch with Andrea Boland. The Maine state representative answers e-mails and lists her business and home phone numbers on the Web. But unlike many politicians surgically attached to their BlackBerrys, she keeps her cell switched off unless she\'s expecting a call. And if she has her way, everyone in Maine — and perhaps, eventually, the rest of the U.S. — will similarly think twice before jabbering away on their mobiles.  In March, Maine\'s legislature will begin debating a bill she submitted that would require manufacturers to put a warning label on every cell phone sold in the state declaring,\'This device emits electromagnetic radiation, exposure to which may cause brain cancer.\'Her warning would continue,\'Users, especially children and pregnant women, should keep this device away from the head and body.\'For those of you now eyeing your cell phones suspiciously, it\'s worth noting that both the National Cancer Institute and the World Health Organization say there isn\'t evidence to support the assertion that cell phones are a public-health threat. But a number of scientists are worried that there has been a dangerous rush to declare cell phones safe, using studies they feel are inadequate and too often weighted toward the wireless industry\'s interests. An analysis published by University of Washington neurologist Henry Lai determined that far more independent studies than industry-funded studies have found at least some type of biological effect from cell-phone exposure. Several countries — including Finland, Israel and France — have issued guidelines for cell-phone use. And San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom, who began researching the issue when his wife was expecting their first child, is hoping his city will adopt legislation that would have manufacturers print radiation information on cell-phone packaging and manuals and require retailers to display the data on the sales floor.  With 270 million Americans and 4 billion people around the world using cell phones — and more signing up every day — a strong link between mobiles and cancer could have major public-health implications. As cell phones make and take calls, they emit low-level radio-frequency (RF) radiation. Stronger than FM radio signals, these RF waves are still a billionth the intensity of known carcinogenic radiation like X-rays. The wireless industry contends that RF radiation lacks the strength to alter molecules in the human body; the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) maximum for cell-phone-signal exposure is intended to prevent RF radiation from heating tissue to the point that cells are damaged. Cell-phone RF radiation\'s\'effect on the body, at least at this time, appears to be insufficient to produce genetic damage typically associated with developing cancer,\'Dr. Robert Hoover, director of the National Cancer Institute\'s Epidemiology and Biostatistics Program, testified at a 2008 congressional hearing. But the body of research is far from conclusive. In 1995, Lai co-wrote a study showing that a single two-hour exposure of RF radiation — at levels considered safe by U.S. standards — produced the sort of genetic damage in rats\' brain cells that can lead to cancer.
While I am giving the finishing touches at LineBall (yes, I found a sponsor), I want you to play ColorBallz. It\'s a simple game I made in a couple of days starting from Basic Filler engine with Box2D   part 1, 2 and 3.  All in all it\'s almost the same game, I just a,\'ed a twist introducing colors. You\'ll get a bonus if you fill the area with the same percentage of red, green and cyan colors. Although I already have two games about to be published, this is the first of my 10 games to be released in 2010.  It\'s monetized with MochiAds but I\'m also planning to sell the complete source code once it\'s polished and fully commented.  At the moment, after 6 days in the wild, it has more than 100K plays  hope to reach one million in a couple of weeks.  Enjoy. Before you start reading this tutorial, there is something you must do.  Turn off the lights, close your eyes, raise your hands, and say:  « Hail, Lord of Flash Game. Shall I read this tutorial and forget it before I try to flood the web with another silly Coloring Book Game »  Really, seriously  I am showing you how do it but please, please  don\'t do it.  Finding the right image  If you can\'t draw your image, you\'ll have to download it from the web. Try to Google for coloring book and you\'ll know what I mean.  Just remember the \'copyright\' word  I don\'t think you\'re allowed to use Ben 10 or Hello Kitty images  but if you are about to create a Flash coloring book, you are an evil person and stealing artworks won\'t be a problem.  The image I\'ll use is taken from www.coloringbook.info  Main concept  Every colorable part is a distinct movieclip, and its color is dynamically changed with Actionscript  Converting the image  First, you need to import it into Flash  It\'s a Box2D library designed to allow game developers making 2D side-scrolling platform games, including a graphical level builder that allows you to drag, drop, and customize all of the game objects and art in your game.
Everything in marketing has changed. The way budgets are divided. The way strategies are constructed. The way we view our customer and their needs. And why is this? Social media. Yes ‘social media\', the term that is used the world over by overpaid boardroom bluffers, blagging their way through a maze of seeding, virals, apps and videos of monkeys skateboarding.  Don\'t get me wrong, done well (the vast majority are not) social media campaigns can engage the customer in a way that couldn\'t have been imagined a decade or even five years ago. But my question is this; why when the internet is as free as the air we breathe, do digital agencies increasingly raise the budgetary bar? It\'s easy to see that some major brands are being convinced that they need enormous budgets to get results, whether that means investing in expensive applications and widgets or simply for the experience of the ‘Digital Guru\' they employ. In my experience there are indeed times when spending budget on social media tools and technologies is helpful or even crucial, but on-the-whole the most valuable asset we have when constructing social media campaigns remains our imagination. I know that sounds ‘Disney\', but it\'s true. Chances are that the simplest idea, the idea the uses existing, free platforms and technology will capture the publics attention.  We have all been in countless brainstorms that have gone absolutely nowhere; producing tired strategies that couldn\'t sell Megan Fox to a 14-year-old. But every once in a while, in what seems like your 20th meeting of the day, someone will lean back, grin and smugly utter the words \'what if we did this \'. It\'s instant; everyone in the room knows that this idea is the one. You don\'t know whether to kiss or punch the unsuspecting genius, but you all know that\'s what he is, a genius. I can only imagine that the following IKEA campaign was born of one of these moments.  Using a Facebook facility familiar to all of us, IKEA captured the attention of thousands of customers in launching their Malmo store. The following video case study shows the industry that, when it comes to social media, there is simply no substituting for that creative moment...
I encountered some ideas on web discussions like - you don\'t need filters with digital, or the only filter you need is a polarizer, the rest can be done in post processing.... however, the Big Six filters that are useful to most photographers, cannot adequately replace with digital techniques.....  One - The Polarizer  This is so obvious I shouldnâ€™t need to get into\'why\'you need it, but Iâ€™m me, and that means Iâ€™m going to talk about it anyway. Any time light moves from air to a transparent substance, some of the light doesnâ€™t penetrate into the transparent substance and is reflected away. Whether the light hits water on a lake, the natural oil on human skin, clear cellulose and wax on plant leaves and flowers, lacquer on a car or a guitar, or glass on a building, there are reflections. The reflections are â€œwhite lightâ€; they â€œfill inâ€ the color and reduce saturation. They reduce the detail visible under the clear substance. The blue of the sky is also polarized, and a polarizer can deepen the blue, and keep it from blowing out and rendering your sky a cloudless white or a drab gray.  You can fight this with post processing, but you wonâ€™t win. When you boost saturation, you fix the things that were\'robbed\'of contrast, but you also oversaturate the things that weren\'t suffering from contrast robbing reflections. And you canâ€™t replace the lost detail.  Two - The 80A\'Color Balancing\'Most cameras have sensors that are\'daylight balanced\'. They have nice, balanced red, green, and blue channel responses in neutral colored scenes lit by daylight. They achieve their incandescent white balance by amplifying the blue channel over two full stops relative to the red channel. That a,\'s a great deal of noise to the blue channel, so you see some pretty ugly shadows. It also makes it very easy to blow the red channel, especially when shooting red dominated subjects (human skin, cosmetics, and fall colors near dusk and dawn when the light is warm).  Using an 80A will often let you get an interior architecture image in a single shot that would have taken multiple shots and HDR to do otherwise. It also makes it much easier to shoot incandescent or candlelit scenes without blowing the red channel.  Three â€\' The Neodymium Enhancing  Sensor manufacturers (like film manufacturers before them) spend a lot of effort trying to get the red, green, and blue filters in the camera to do a tolerable job of seeing colors the same way a human eye sees them. Normally, this is a\'good thing\', it reduces an annoying phenomena we techno-geeks call a\'failure in observer metamerism\', where colors that look identical to one\'observer\'(a human) look different to another observer (a camera, for example). The neodymium filter disrupts the nice\'mimic the eye\'characteristics of a sensor, and causes large-scale failures of observer metamerism. Neodymium (sometimes called â€œdidymiumâ€) does it in a way that is very pleasing in a landscape or fall color photograph: browns that would be identical in the picture (or to the eye) su,\'enly separate, with one turning red, another going yellow.
Less than a month after the failure of its third launch attempt, the California-based firm Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX) is poised once more to loft a Falcon 1 rocket. Launch of SpaceX\'s fourth Falcon 1 rocket is set for sometime between 7:00 p.m. EDT (2300 GMT) tonight and 12:00 a.m. EDT (0400 GMT) on Monday, according to an update from the firm\'s CEO Elon Musk. \'Of course, if we see anything that requires investigation, the launch will be postponed, but we\'ll let you know as soon as we know,\' Musk wrote in an update posted to the SpaceX Web site on Saturday. Tonight\'s planned liftoff will be staged from SpaceX\'s launch site at the U.S. Army\'s Ronald Reagan Ballistic Defense Test Site on the Kwajalein Atoll in the about 2,500 miles (4,023 km) southwest of Hawaii in the central Pacific Ocean. The launch will be broadcast live on the SpaceX Web site (http://www.spacex.com) when the attempt begins. SpaceX\'s Falcon 1 rocket is a two-stage rocket with a reusable first stage that stands 68 feet tall (21 meters) and can haul payloads of up to about 1,256 pounds (570 kg) to low-Earth orbit. The $6.7 million rocket weighs 60,000 pounds (27,200 kg), but has failed three consecutive times since its 2006 debut. On Aug. 2, SpaceX launched its third Falcon 1 test flight only to watch it fail when the booster\'s first stage separated, then impacted the second stage as both flew 135 miles (217 km) above Earth. An engine shutdown timing error was cited as the cause and could be fixed relatively easily, Musk said at the time. \'The fix was also very simple, requiring one line of code to be change,\'d SpaceX officials said in a weekend update. While all three of SpaceX\'s first Falcon 1 launches have carried small satellite payloads, the fourth rocket is carrying \'a a payload mass simulator of approximately 165 kg (364 lbs), designed and built by SpaceX specifically for this mission,\' SpaceX officials said. China is just a week away from  launching its third manned spaceflight into orbit and apparently hoping for a sell-out crowd. The country is selling tickets to watch for the planned late night Sept. 25 launch of its Shenzhou 7 spacecraft, but buyer beware: Each seat goes for about 15,000 yuan, or about US$2,206 and ticket buyers will need to provide identification and a reference from their employer to vie for the limited spaces, according to the Chinese Web site China Daily and the newspaper Wenhui Daily. While hefty, the ticket price apparently includes a flight to China\'s Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in the northwestern Gansu province, as well as a four-day stay to watch the planned space shot, state media reported. China first invited space fans to buy tickets for a rocket launch last year, when the country launched the Chang\'e 1 moon probe from the Xichang launch center in southwestern Sichuan province. But those tickets went for about 800 yuan, or US$117, per person. Some 2,000 people watched the lunar mission\'s launch from a pair of platforms about 1.5 miles (2.5 km) away, according to press reports. But the northwestern-located Jiuquan launch site is much more remote than Xichang, and offers fewer amenities and other tourist hot spots, China Daily reported.
Easy, but not necessarily right. In a letter to his younger brother, Theo, from the asylum, van Gogh articulately describes his deliberate approach to the work.\'These are exaggerations from the point of view of the arrangement, their lines are contorted like those of the ancient woodcuts,\'he writes. He even flicks at the criticism he anticipates:\'People will tell me the mountains aren\'t like that.\'And with a literary flourish, he describes the effect he\'s after:\'I\'ve tried to express the time of day when one sees the green beetles and the cicadas flying in the heat.\'For all his troubles, van Gogh possessed a powerful intellect and self-awareness that he revealed as much in his writing as in his art. A prolific correspondent, his letters were collected last year into a new six-volume edition that rounds out his personality. Now a selection of those letters is on display alongside some of his finest paintings in the London Royal Academy\'s illuminating exhibition The Real Van Gogh: The Artist and His Letters. (A bank of computers in one gallery offers instant online access to the entire correspondence.) They present a painter\'s lucid, blow-by-blow report on his own progress up to the end of his life.  There is no doubt that van Gogh was driven. He could work at a pace that suggests manic intensity as well as spontaneity. In the last 70 days of his life, he produced more than 70 paintings. But what the letters frequently reveal is careful preparation; he painted with a speed derived from forethought rather than wild-eyed frenzy. His correspondence with Theo is scattered with sketches of proposed pictures, sometimes with color notations to give a better impression of the final work.  The broad outlines of his later years suggest the artist\'s struggles with mental illness: bouts of heavy drinking and brothel-going, poverty and isolation, his explosive reaction to light and color in Provence, his quarrel with fellow artist Paul Gauguin, self-mutilation—he presented his severed ear to a favorite prostitute—and finally his suicide at the age of 37. It all feeds the conventional picture of the artist as wayward genius.
Well, that was something wasn\'t it? Good luck topping that upset, everyone else left in the field.  Good to see Bill Self revive the old Roy Williams tradition of bringing a talented Kansas team favorite to the NCAA Tournament and then turfing out in the second round. (I never forget a bracket scorned.) That\'s what you get for messing with Kurt Warner. Oh, don\'t think his blessed name won\'t come up a few times this week. If he\'s not sitting front row at the regional I\'ll eat this delicious Kansas sunflower that just shriveled up in front of me and died.  And it\'s not even over! Two more games for you to curl up by the fire with. Kentucky-Wake Forest and Kansas State-BYU. What\'s that? You\'ve already had too much nail-biting basketball today? Well, suck it up, junior, because THAT\'S JUST TOO BAD! You\'re going to watch and like it.  Seriously, you\'ve come this far. What\'s two more games? John Wall. Frank\'Don\'t Call Me Frank\'Martin. JIMMER! It\'s a who\'s who of guys you barely know anything about, yet are o,\'ly fascinated by. Just order the pizza and cancel the babysitter. You\'re not going anywhere.
After a controversial delay in release last fall, Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio\'s fourth collaboration Shutter Island has finally arrived. Only an acclaimed master like the man who brought us Raging Bull and Taxi Driver would be bold enough to adapt Dennis Lehane\'s 2003 best selling mystery and faithfully recreate its haunting tone and down right creepiness. Scorsese\'s talent for subliminally affecting his audience with his visual style is nearly unrivaled. There are many sights to behold in Shutter Island, some of them puzzling and others so bizarre that they may eventually find their way into your subconscious. What begins as a routine mystery soon evolves into a psychological trip. Set in 1954 U.S. Marshals Te,\'y Daniels (DiCaprio) and his partner Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) arrive by ferry to Shutter Island off the coast of Massachusetts and home of Ashcliffe Mental Hospital for the Criminally Insane. Summoned by Doctor Cawley (Ben Kingsley) and Deputy Warden McPherson (John Carol Lynch), Te,\'y and Chuck must investigate the disappearance of a dangerous patient. Ashcliffe might as well be considered a fortress, because it looks inescapable, yet Rachel Solondo, a woman who drowned her three children, managed to vanish the night before. Upon examination of her locked room, Te,\'y discovers no evidence of an escape and begins to speculate it could have been an inside job. A clue left behind by Rachel, that initially appear to be the scribblings of an insane woman, reveals itself to be a code called \'the Code of Four\' which Te,\'y will frequently encounter. After a fruitless search of the island, Te,\'y and Chuck discovers one of the staff members, a Dr. Sheehan, is also missing and speculate that he may have helped Rachel escape
Amidst talk of an aging society and a depleting demographic dividend, appeals for a reconsideration of China\'s One-Child Policy were voiced during the annual meetings of the National People\'s Congress and the Chinese People\'s Political Consultative Conference held Mar. 3 to 14.  Zhang Yin, China\'s wealthiest woman and member of the Chinese People\'s Political Consultative Conference, called for a \'gradual release\' from the 30 year-old policy, with a three to five year trial period allowing some the right to have a second child before the nation as a whole.  In an interview with Southern Weekend Zhang said she was one among many who voiced concern over China\'s low birth rate and the consequences of an aging society. (photo/Don Weinland)  (photo/Don Weinland)  In an open letter issued by the Communist Party\'s central committee in September of 1980, the One-Child Policy was suggested in order to relieve the demographic tensions of runaway birth rates.  The letter states that after 30 years of state controlled family planning, \'different demographic policies can be adopted.
Last week we reprinted an article discussing the 3 steps design teams take when creating an experience vision to guide the direction of design toward their users\' ideal experience. Once a design team creates that experience vision, they need to share it with everyone involved in the project to make sure everyone is on the same page as the design process progresses.  While the process of conveying the vision to key decision makers on the project and within the organization is very important, the methods used to share the vision can vary greatly depending on budget, available resources, and the pool of creative talent. Teams can use any technique, from expensive video-shoots with actors to low-fidelity stop-motion animation, as long as the vision helps the design team and stakeholders progress in the same direction and inspires team members to produce an improved experience.  In this week\'s UIEtips article, I once again go back to an article UIE published in June 2007. In this article, Knowledge Navigator Deconstructed: Building an Envisionment, I discuss how a successful envisionment that focuses on the users\' ideal experiences can lead a design team\'s direction for years to come. I also explore the many creative techniques for making that vision clear to everyone involved with the project.  Does your organization have an experience vision? How are you guiding your design direction toward your users\' ideal experiences? What methods to share this vision have you used? Join the discussion about this week\'s topic below.  Also, I\'m conducting a one day workshop in three different cities on Secrets Behind Designing Great User Experiences. One of the topics covered is the Making of a UX Vision. I take the concepts I discuss in the article into greater depth.
The new tax will not be an\'insurance fund\'for the banking industry, as ministers are concerned that such a measure would simply encourage more risky behaviour of the sort that led to the financial crisis of 2008. Instead resolution agreements (also known as living wills) will mean banks will be forced to break up should they ever fail again.\'We do not see the point of creating a mega-fund to prepare for another banking failure,\'said one well-placed source.\'We do think that where people are creating risk for the tax payer they should be taxed accordingly.\'It will be similar to pollution taxes on industry to discourage damage to the environment.\'The International Monetary Fund will report next month on how the global community should respond to the need to control systemic risk in the financial system. It is believed that Dominique Strauss-Kahn, head of the IMF, will broadly welcome plans for extra taxes on banking\'s riskier activities.  Treasury officials said that Britain would not\'go it alone\'on the new tax, and that it was likely there would be agreement on similar tax regimes across the world.  The news comes after David Cameron, the leader of the Opposition, announced that the Conservatives would be willing to act unilaterally on an international banking tax if there was no global agreement.  Tory sources said, though, it was unlikely they would have to, given signals from the G20. President Obama has said that he supports new levies on banking in America.  The UK banking lobby has warned that any tax on banks must not undermine attempts to resuscitate the economy.  Responding to Mr Cameron\'s speech yesterday, a spokesman for the British Bankers\' Association said:\'UK banks have already made changes to how they are structured and the amount of capital and cash they hold to help prevent any future problems.\'We believe any further reforms need to be timely, considered and internationally co-ordinated so they do not restrict credit to individuals and businesses as recovery picks up speed.\'Taxpayer intervention to stabilise the UK banking industry is on track to be paid back. And we will work with everyone on issues around a last-resort intervention fund   as well as other means to protect the taxpayer should a problem arise in the future.But UK banks believe the best course is to wait for the outcome of next month\'s IMF proposals.\'Mr Cameron announced the measures while speaking to supporters in Putney, south-west London.  He said:\'This is no time to shy away from confronting some of the biggest vested interests in our country   the banks. We had the biggest bank bail-out in the world. We can\'t just carry on as if nothing happened.\'Referring to President Obama\'s plans to recover funds used to bail out US banks, he said:\'Why should it be any different here? A Conservative government will introduce a new bank levy to pay back tax payers and to protect them in the future.\'It won\'t be popular in every part of the City. But I believe it\'s fair and it\'s necessary.
I started explaining how atleast I was taking full advantage of my time to have adequate fun as compared to others who were just sitting and complaining.  I was all ready to propose my concept of relativity again. But she had been listening to my rant like she usually does and then talked about one of her experiences. She told about her conversation with a person with no legs and how difficult it must be. But, the guy replied atleast I don\'t suck like the ones who have no legs and feet. Imagine how much it would suck to be them. Suffice it to say my friend was aghast at that attitude. She very simply asked me if maybe I was doing the same thing. If maybe I was the guy with no legs who still thought atleast he was better than a  person with no limbs at all. I replied by saying that I was comparing myself with others not to feel better because of their misery but because I wanted to not be like them. For me it was about motivation rather than wallowing in shared misery. It was one of those moments when you yourself realize you have said something really smart. She thought so too I guess because she actually wrote my rohanism down ;). But this is what your smart friends do to you. They extract these insightful thoughts out of you, but still leave you with doubts. But this is what I relish. This is what I feel is the best part about having them around. Life would be so much simpler if you were surrounded by people as dumb as as yourself. But smarter ones make life interesting. They challenge and disagree with your way of thinking without intending too. That conversation left me in a similar place. Even though I seemed to have convinced my friend, I wasn\'t sure I had convinced myself. But, the great thing about that conversation is that ever since that day, I have pretty much abandoned my silly concept of relativity. Now every time I compare myself in a situation, I take a moment to figure out the reasons for which I am doing it. Ever since that day, I have tried to follow that smart rohanism I uttered out of nowhere. For the most part, it has helped :) I like analogies. I love drawing parallels in life. Compare one stage with another. Find something in common in two completely different walks of your own life or others. To see how as we change we still remain the same. Friends say its an annoying habit of drawing analogies between seemingly disparate sources. To try and explain every occurrence I see by comparing it to something totally mundane and unrelated. As if it\'s a self trained mechanism to automatically explain things to myself that might seem out of the scope of my knowledge base. One thing I have observed with a lot of friends as they have moved away from home for jobs or studies is the su,\'en onset of loneliness.
Specifically, something Hawks coach Joel Quenneville said after throwing minor-league call-up Corey Crawford into the net against the Ducks on Wednesday. Crawford made one mistake, running off the leash and giving up a short-handed goal, but even in losing the horrifically officiated game, the kid played well enough that you know he\'ll get another start.  In fact, he might get it even after Cristobal Huet is sufficiently recovered from the flu. Yeah, that would give the Hawks three goalies, and man, you talk about a crisis of confidence, but Quenneville\'s post-mortem on Crawford makes me think it\'s coming.  Quenneville said Crawford \'looked comfortable\' and \'looked big.\' Those might seem to be harmless phrases because it comes down to stopping the puck and winning games, but here\'s the thing: A coach doesn\'t know that until it\'s too late, until after the game, so he has to make a decision based on stats and gut feeling, not always in that order and not always equally.  In Quenneville\'s case, the \'looked comfortable\' part is code for a coach feeling comfortable. The \'looked big\' part is how much net the goalie leaves open, especially after he drops to the ice. If there has been one significant reason that Quenneville continually turns to rookie Antti Niemi when looking for a goalie to get hot and make him feel comfortable, it\'s that. How much net can you cover when you\'re vulnerable?  Niemi and Crawford each are listed at 6-foot-2, an inch taller than Huet, but Niemi and Crawford play bigger and wider when they go down. Shooters appear to have less space up top against them than against Huet. Anybody can play goalie if the Hawks are going to check the way they smothered the Kings --- good thing, too, what with their lousy passing and puck handling --- but nobody can do that every night and goalies have to win games, or at least look like they can do it in difficult situations.  Bigger goalies do that. Or goalies who appear to be bigger targets. Size matters. So, you watch, Crawford will be coming to a net near you. I would tell Huet to get well quickly, but I don\'t know if it will matter.
In case you have broken legs or are allergic to joy or something and you can\'t leave your house this beautiful weekend, we suggest you catch up with Breaking Bad in time for the third season premiere on Sunday.  Let\'s just put it up front: I know we had a big old BB takeover on this here webbersite just yesterday, but this has nothing to do with that. I genuinely happen to like something that our ad people took money from. Why do I like it so much?  Well, it\'s smart and exciting and moving without showing any of the pesky nuts and bolts of what make a show smart and exciting and moving. You know how on Mad Men sometimes, just sometimes, you can almost see the writers straining to get that story arc so perfectly crafted? That doesn\'t happen on Breaking Bad, probably because by design it\'s smaller, lower to the ground, scruffier. It\'s a show about a guy dying of cancer who starts cooking meth to leave his family with some money and is therefore about big things like Death & Dying and The Drug Trade In the American Southwest, but it\'s also maybe the most quietly pro-family (in the good way) show on the air. It\'s got a deep and satisfying and thoroughly realistic humanity to it that makes you feel like you\'re watching friends, people you know. Which makes it all the more shocking when the drugs and the guns and the bodies start piling up.
Back in January, we called Tina Fey \'the first true female Woody Allen\' — and quickly a,\'ed, \'Which is not to discount Cathy Guisewite and her clear influence on 30 Rock.\' And wouldn\'t you know it: Last night, when Liz Lemon ran into her starchy anti-husband Wesley (last name Snipes) at a showing of Hot Tub Time Machine (nice product placement! We\'re totally seeing that), their inevitable bickering led Wesley to compare Liz\'s life to \'something out of a Cathy cartoon — it just won\'t end.\' Now, comparing 30 Rock to Cathy isn\'t exactly obscure or brilliant, but to do it in such a terrific episode — really, a Cathy parody — reminds us of just how sharp this show remains.  Things got off to a lightning-paced start, with Jack\'s company-wide meeting that devolved, randomly and almost immediately, into city rivalries, with Boston-bred Jack throwing a battery at Liz in return for her Philly snowball, and all of it culminating in Jenna shoving a man away from the mike and breaking out into \'Amazing Grace.\' The stories that followed — Jack trying to fit in at Kabletown (and suggesting \'porn for women,\' meh), Liz contemplating Wesley (Snipes) for a \'settling soul mate,\' and Tracy dealing with the world\'s discovery of his fidelity to his wife — were all quite comfortably situated in the show\'s wheelhouse, but great vehicles for the gags, a few of which we can\'t resist bullet-pointing here.  • Tracy\'s Ben and Jerry\'s flavor, \'Adultaraisin.\' • Tracy\'s Post headline, \'Old Faithful.\' • The glimpse of the lesbian and the Hasid canoodling in the dentist\'s recovery room. • Jenna confusing Tiger Woods and O.J. Simpson. Yikes! • Jack \'the Master Baiter\' Donaghy • \'I innovate products.\' • Don Geiss encased in Carbonite. • And greatest of all, Fresh Ass: Based on the Novel Tush by Assfire  Read more: 30 Rock Recap: Gangway for Foot Cycle! -- Vulture http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2010/03/30_rock_recap_gangway_for_foot.html#ixzz0idh4Vh9o
Architectural design is always about the future; when architects make a proposition they always assume that it takes place in some imagined future. Architects nearly always assume that this future will be ‘better\' than the present, often as a consequence of what is being proposed. Architecture is, by its very nature, utopian. Contemporary architecture, unlike earlier models of ‘utopian\' architecture, or perhaps because of the stigma attached to those models, has resisted an explicitly social and political agenda. Instead it has become driven by ‘ideal\' formalist agendas facilitated by the ‘shape-making\' potential of new computer-based design tools and funded by speculative finance. Indeed, the most important transformations that have occurred in architecture over the last 30 years have not been in the shifts in fashion marking out new typologies, new forms of representation, new materials or new forms of manufacture; the biggest single shift has been in the new economic relations within the building industry and the new forms of contractual relationships that this has brought about. The rise of fast-track construction in the 1980s heralded a major change in the motivations for construction and brought about a homogenisation of building output largely predicated on maximising the economic value of the project, often with little regard for its social value. And with the introduction of the Private Finance Initiative (PFI) the current UK government has turned even health-care and educational building programmes into a speculative enterprise. PFI has always been presented as a cost-effective way of financing large infrastructural projects; however, like the government\'s recent bail out of the banks, it works on the principle of the public financing the risk while the private sector skims off the profit.[3] For a number of years the single model that has shaped the type of future that the architectural profession has based its assumptions on is one of unfettered consumer expansion. The majority of recent architectural debates have not tried to call into question the economic imperatives of late capitalism that drive financial speculation and generate the context within which private development is presented as the only option. Even the avant-garde architectural firms of the 1980s are now operating as large international commercial practices, and the Deconstructivists have proved to be more than enthusiastic capitalists. The critical and intellectual ambitions inspired by Jacques Derrida, Gilles Deleuze and Guy Debord have been replaced with the monetarist ideologies of Milton Friedman and Alan Greenspan.  The architectural profession has embraced the late capitalist model enthusiastically and uncritically, while all the time pandering to the concepts of social and environmental responsibility. The fact is that this model has been funded through speculative investment, and now that the money has run out the profession is bereft of alternatives.
Here\'s an equation I bet you\'ve never seen in a math class:  Buick LaCrosse + Providence at lunchtime = Serious Sandwiches.  Let me explain. Alaina and I cruised out of Boston at around 11:30. Our plan: head to Providence for a mini sandwich tour. (That\'d be a limited tour of Providence sandwiches—not a tour of Providence mini-sandwiches.) I\'ve been hearing a lot about the sandwiches made and sold at the the food store-cum-cheese shop Farmstead, by husband and wife chef team Matt and Kate Jennings (owners of the highly regarded bistro La Laiterie).  I figured that we would take our sandwiches and eat them in our roomy LaCrosse as we made our way to our second Providence sandwich shop, Hewtin\'s Mobile Hot Dog Truck, owned by another Providence based husband and wife team—Matthew and Kristin Gennuso of Chez Pascal. What better time to visit a food truck in New England than on a sunny day in mid-March, with wheels at your disposal? And since we\'d left Carey behind in Boston, we rendezvoused with one of our terrific Serious Eats interns, Brown student Leah Douglas.  Sounds like a pretty cool itinerary, doesn\'t it? When we arrived at Farmstead, it turned out there was seating available at La Laiterie, so we were able to enjoy a leisurely lunch utilizing real tables and chairs. As is our wont, we ordered just about every sandwich on the menu. The highlights? The cheesemonger\'s grilled cheese was in fact made in a sandwich press rather than grilled. I don\'t even know what cheeses were in it, but there was definitely something che,\'ar-y in there because the sandwich had that primordial che,\'ar ooze. A,\' in a helpful (if a little disorganized) staff that was eager to please and you end up with a fine lunch first course.
Apple will be hosting a WebKit Contributors Meeting at its campus in Cupertino, CA on Monday, April 12 and Tuesday, April 13 from 9am to 6pm PDT. The meeting is targeted at contributors to the WebKit Open Source Project. The meeting will have an \'unconference\'-like format, allowing plenty of time for impromptu sessions/discussions and hacking.  A new mailing list, webkit-meeting, will be used for general discussion and to communicate a,\'itional information about the meeting. You can subscribe at lists.webkit.org. Questions may also be sent to Adele Peterson at adele at webkit.org.  The meeting will be free of charge. All WebKit contributors are encouraged to attend. However, space is limited, so registrations will be accepted on a first come, first served basis.  Please register for the meeting using the meeting registration form by Thursday, April 1.  We hope to see you there!   Daniel has made many valuable contributions to WebKit including a,\'itions to the XSSAuditor, which helps prevent reflective cross site scripting attacks, as well as numerous changes to drag and drop ensuring that WebKit complies with the HTML5 spec. Of course, all of this was supported with thorough tests and improvements to WebKit\'s testing harness. Recently, Daniel has been working on features for mobile devices such as a cross platform patch to enable faster mobile scrolling on pages with static background images.  Please join me in congratulating Daniel on his reviewer status!   Nate got his start in WebKit with helping to upstream Javascript bindings for the Chromium port into WebKit. During that work, he learned much about WebKit style as well as getting to know the bindings quite well.

In a,\'ition, he also a,\'ed noreferrer support and fixed bugs in a variety of areas such as the loader and plugin scripting.  Please join me in congratulating Nate on his reviewer status!   Jeremy has done a lot of work on local storage and session storage within WebKit. Much of this brought it up to date with spec changes, but he also improved it by a,\'ing quota support and fixing many bugs. As part of the Chromium port, he also worked on its WebKit api and JavaScript bindings.  Please join me in congratulating Jeremy on his reviewer status!
The word blog is a conflation of two words: Web and log. It contains in its four letters a concise and accurate self-description: it is a log of thoughts and writing posted publicly on the World Wide Web. In the monosyllabic vernacular of the Internet, Web log soon became the word blog. This form of instant and global self-publishing, made possible by technology widely available only for the past decade or so, allows for no retroactive editing (apart from fixing minor typos or small glitches) and removes from the act of writing any considered or lengthy review. It is the spontaneous expression of instant thought—impermanent beyond even the ephemera of daily journalism. It is accountable in immediate and unavoidable ways to readers and other bloggers, and linked via hypertext to continuously multiplying references and sources. Unlike any single piece of print journalism, its borders are extremely porous and its truth inherently transitory. The consequences of this for the act of writing are still sinking in.  A ship\'s log owes its name to a small wooden board, often weighted with lead, that was for centuries attached to a line and thrown over the stern. The weight of the log would keep it in the same place in the water, like a provisional anchor, while the ship moved away. By measuring the length of line used up in a set period of time, mariners could calculate the speed of their journey (the rope itself was marked by equidistant \'knots\' for easy measurement). As a ship\'s voyage progressed, the course came to be marked down in a book that was called a log. In journeys at sea that took place before radio or radar or satellites or sonar, these logs were an indispensable source for recording what actually happened. They helped navigators surmise where they were and how far they had traveled and how much longer they had to stay at sea. They provided accountability to a ship\'s owners and traders. They were designed to be as immune to faking as possible. Away from land, there was usually no reliable corroboration of events apart from the crew\'s own account in the mi,\'le of an expanse of blue and gray and green; and in long journeys, memories always blur and facts disperse. A log provided as accurate an account as could be gleaned in real time.  As you read a log, you have the curious sense of moving backward in time as you move forward in pages—the opposite of a book. As you piece together a narrative that was never intended as one, it seems—and is—more truthful. Logs, in this sense, were a form of human self-correction. They amended for hindsight, for the ways in which human beings order and tidy and construct the story of their lives as they look back on them. Logs require a letting-go of narrative because they do not allow for a knowledge of the ending. So they have plot as well as dramatic irony—the reader will know the ending before the writer did.
Outfitted with burly outsoles, waterproof materials, and big toe guards, trail shoes are built to bring you closer to nature. As the following reviews indicate, not every trail shoe is perfect for every off-road outing. Some are built low and feature sticky treads that grip mucky footpaths and shale-strewn climbs. Others have smaller treads and thicker cushioning more appropriate for less-rugged terrain. To determine how they measure up, we analyzed each shoe at the RW Shoe Lab and tested them on the feet of more than 200 runners. We found these nine shoes to be the best for tackling the trails. WE SAY This is one of the few trail shoes with enough cushioning to handle long stretches of road and still provide sure footing on loose terrain and mud, thanks to its deep lugs. It also features a grippy edge in the heel that helps maintain traction going downhill. RW Shoe Lab tests show the shoe\'s heel and forefoot to be among the softest in this guide. All this cushioning results in a bulkier-than average midsole that some testers felt lifted them too high off the ground. Recommended for trail runners who frequently mix in some roads and don\'t want to sacrifice off-road traction.  WEAR-TESTER SAYS\'I liked the traction, but the heel felt high.\'—Jenna Druver, 32, East Lansing
I can respect conservatives who can respect liberals. I can work with conservatives who are willing to work with progressives. If your goal is to move America rather than your party forward, than I\'d like to shake your hand and find a way to do it together. What I cannot respect are people who think it\'s painfully obvious that their beliefs are the one and only definition of\'right\'or of\'American.\'I cannot abide for half a second those people who think anyone even half an inch different than they are unpatriotic, socialist, elitist, stupid, or undeserving.  And that is why I loathe Glenn Beck and the Tea Party movement. You think government is too big? Okay, I get that. You think the President is taking us down a bad path? I disagree, but whatever. You believe Congress is broken? Who doesn\'t. You think black people who dare to disagree with you are Soviet Kenyan n------s who gas Jews? Well in that case, you represent none of the best and all of the worst of American history, you racist, uninformed, self-righteous, cowardly, unpatriotic, anarchist halfwit toads. Roll Call reports: Do these a,\'le-brained huns really think they\'re going to change anyone\'s mind with racist name calling? Do you they honestly think that this tripe passes for factual discourse? As conservative Joe Scarborough tweets,\'John Lewis is a friend, a great man and an American hero. Anyone attacking such a man with racial slurs has a dark heart and a grim soul.\'And\'Also, the attacks against Barney Frank were hateful and outrageous. Barney and I usually disagreed in Congress but he loves his country.
Lancs are through to Barbados T20 semi  Posted By graham.hardcastle for World of Sport     Lancashire have just sneaked through to Finals Day of the Twenty20 competition at the Kensington Oval in Barbados.  The Red Rose county were made to work hard with the bat in their pursuit of 131 against a select XI from the host Island, but Tom Smith\'s 48 was the mainstay of their reply. The Lightning won with three wickets and two balls to spare.  The left-hander looked upset at being given out caught behind when the ball seemed to loop up off his pad onto his gloves and through to the keeper.  I remember him telling me last year that he was gutted not to be there at the end of a win against Glamorgan at the SWALEC after doing all the hard work, and this was a similar circumstance.  Lancashire will now play Essex in the first semi-final early evening your time back home (5.30pm), while Roses rivals Yorkshire were the shock losers of the day. They went down by 58 runs to a University of the West Indies XI after being bowled out for 63!!  There were a couple of hundred spectators throughout the day at the impressive Kensington Oval, and there are a few more expected for the Finals Day tomorrow due to the fact that there is some home presence in the students.  There was a little bit of a worry for the Lightning, with skipper Glen Chapple taking a bang on his finger during fielding.  He only bowled two overs before leaving the field and letting Mark Chilton take over the leadership duties.  Chappie came back out to bat later on to help guide his side over the winning line, but Peter Moores said afterwards that he might not be fit to play in the semi and hopefully final of the Barbados Cricket Cup.  I remember the ex-England man tearing a hamstring in Sharjah last pre-season, but this injury doesn\'t sound anywhere near as serious.
On March 12th, Matt Damon and director Paul Greengrass will be together again in theaters for their latest action thriller, \'Green Zone,\' a film set in the chaotic early days of the Iraqi War when no one could be trusted and every decision could detonate unforeseen consequences. Damon and Greengrass have clearly proven that they\'ve got chemistry, what with their work together on \'The Bourne Supremacy\' and \'The Bourne Ultimatum,\' and we\'re obviously looking forward to checking it out, but well, here\'s the thing: Damon\'s a great action hero, but he can be pretty hilarious, too, and \'Green Zone\' doesn\'t exactly look like what you\'d call a laff riot. 1. Glory Daze (1996): Okay, we\'ll be honest with you: Damon\'s barely in this film. It\'s really a vehicle for his longtime bu,\'y, Ben Affleck, who sports some seriously douche-tastic facial hair throughout the film. Although the remarkable number of recognizable faces to be found within the cast make it worth checking out (Sam Rockwell, Alyssa Milano, Matthew McConaughey, John Rhys-Davies, Kristin Bauer, French Stewart, Brendan Fraser, Leah Remini, Meredith Salinger, Mary Woronov, and Spaulding Gray all make appearances), the predominant reason we\'ve included \'Glory Daze\'   which is, for the record, explores the hesitation all college graduates experience before entering the real world   is because no matter how many films he may eventually have to his credit, Matt Damon should never be allowed to escape the fact that, even though it was only for a few fleeting moments, he once played a character named Edward Pudwacker.
To me, one of the most enjoyable parts of a baseball card is not so much the player, but what\'s in the background of the photo. It\'s especially fun when an old advertisement takes a prominent spot, like this one of Bill Fahey from 1973 Topps. (In fact, 1973 Topps may contain the greatest photo backgrounds of any set, ever, but that\'s a topic for another post.) In plain sight to the left of Fahey there\'s an ad for the fine dining and cocktail options available at Harris\' Imperial House in Boca Raton, Florida. The card also features an ad for Fowlkes Chevrolet, which, judging from information available on the Web, may or may not be related in some way with Mayes Chevrolet, which had been on the former Storyland Park property in Broward County, Florida (Pompano Beach: A History). Next time you\'re going through your cards, find a good one with a prominent ad in the background of the player photo and post a scan on The Baseball Card Blog\'s Facebook page. I bet we\'ll get a great gallery going.
This is a totally different way from thinking about things than I think we see nowadays. I kind of liken it to how I tell students not to program. If you\'re implementing something moderately complex (say, forward/backward algorithm), first write down all the math, then start implementing. Don\'t start implementing first. I think nowadays (and sure, I\'m guilty!) we see a lot of implementing without the math. Or rather, with plenty of math, but without a representational model of what it is that we\'re studying. The central claim of the RST paper is that one can think of texts as being organized into elementary discourse units, and these are connected into a tree structure by relations like the one above. (Or at least this is my reading of it.) That is, they have laid out a representation of text and claimed that this is how texts get put together. As a second example (this will be sorter), take Wendy Lehnert\'s 1982 paper,\'Plot units and narrative summarization.\'Here, the story is about how stories get put together. The most interesting thing about the plot units model to me is that it breaks from how one might naturally think about stories. That is, I would naively think of a story as a series of events. The claim that Lehnert makes is that this is not the right way to think about it. Rather, we should think about stories as sequences of affect states. Effectively, an affect state is how a character is feeling at any time. (This isn\'t quite right, but it\'s close enough.) For example, Lehnert presents the following story: When John tried to start his care this morning, it wouldn\'t turn over. He asked his neighbor Paul for help. Paul did something to the carburetor and got it going. John thanked Paul and drove to work.
I finished K-means and Gaussian mixture models in class last week or maybe the week before. I\'ve previously discussed the fact that these two are really solving different problems (despite being structurally so similar), but today\'s post is about something different. There are two primary differences between the typical presentation of K-means and the typical presentation of GMMs. (I say\'typical\'because you can modify these algorithms fairly extensively as you see fit.) The first difference is that GMMs just have more parameters. The parameters of K-means are typically the cluster assignments (\'z\') and the means (\'mu\'). The parameters of a GMM are typically these (z and mu) as well as the class prior probabilities (\'pi\') and cluster covariances (\'Sigma\'). The GMM model is just richer. Of course, you can restrict it so all clusters are isotropic and all prior probabilities are even, in which case you\'ve effectively removed this difference (or you can a,\' these things into K-means). The second difference is that GMMs operate under the regime of\'soft assignments,\'meaning that points aren\'t wed to clusters: they only prefer (in a probabilistic sense) some clusters to others. This falls out naturally from the EM formalization, where the soft assignments are simply the expectations of the assignments under the current model. One can get rid of the second difference by running\'hard EM\'(also called\'Viterbi EM\'in NLP land), where the expectations are clamped at their most likely value. This leads to something that has much more of a K-means feel. This\'real EM\'versus\'hard EM\'distinction comes up a lot in NLP, where computing exact expectations is often really difficult. (Sometimes you get complex variants, like the\'pegging\'approaches in the IBM machine translation models, but my understanding from people who run in this circle is that pegging is much ado about nothing.) My general feeling has always been\'if you don\'t have much data, do real EM; if you have tons of data, hard EM is probably okay.\'(This is purely from a practical perspective.) The idea is that when you have tons and tons of data, you can approximate expectations reasonably well by averaging over many data points. (Yes, this is hand-wavy and it\'s easy to construct examples where it fails. But it seems to work many times.) Of course, you can get pedantic and say\'hard EM sucks: it\'s maximizing p(x,z) but I really want to maximize p(x)\'to which I say: ho hum, who cares, you don\'t actually care about p(x), you care about some extrinsic evaluation metric which, crossing your fingers, you hope correlates with p(x), but for all I know it correlates better with p(x,z). Nevertheless, a particular trusted friend has told me he\'s always remiss when he can\'t do full EM and has to do hard EM: he\'s never seen a case where it doesn\'t help. (Or maybe\'rarely\'would be more fair.) Of course, this comes at a price: for many models, maximization (search) can be done in polynomial time, but computing expectations can be #P-hard (basically because you have to enumerate -- or count -- over every possible assignment). Now let\'s think about approximate inference in graphical models. Let\'s say I have a graphical model with some nodes I want to maximize over (call them\'X\') and some nodes I want to marginalize out (call them\'Z\'). For instance, in GMMs, the X nodes would be the means, covariances and cluster priors; the Z nodes would be the assignments. (Note that this is departing slightly from typical notation for EM.) Suppose I want to do inference in such a model. Here are three things I can do:
I always wanted to have a nickname. Something that had to do with an experience, or perhaps from not being able to pronounce my name correctly as a child, or even something wildly nonsensical that had nothing to do with anything. Like Crime Dog. In the grand scheme of things, Crime Dog isn\'t bad (for those not in the know, it refers to MacGruff, the bloodhound in the trenchcoat who encouraged kids on Saturday morning to \'Take a Bite Out of Crime\'), though slightly bizarre. It\'s better than being referred to as Three-Finger or Stumpy. Plus it shortens easily to \'Dog.\' As in, \'Dog, you can carve the turkey\' or \'Hurry Dog, cut the red wire. No no, the red one!\' But that\'s just the thing about nicknames: you don\'t decide if you get one; someone else does. And though most baseball nicknames derive from the player\'s last name, I would bet that Crime Dog was the product of nickname evolution. You don\'t just wake up one morning with a nickname epiphany (unless your name is Shaquille O\'Neal). So unless I become a gangster, a character on a TV show, or join a baseball team, I\'m resigned to spend my life as Ben. Not Piano Legs or Baby Face. Just Ben. Only, simply Ben. I guess it could be worse. At least I won\'t be called Steve Urkel for the rest of my life.
Just run max-product. That is, maximize p(X,Z) rather than p(X). Just run sum-product. That is, compute expectations over X and Z, rather than just over Z. Run EM, by alternating something like sum-product on Z and something like max-product onX. Of these, only (3) is really doing the\'right thing.\'Further, let\'s get away from the notion of p(X) not correlating with some extrinsic evaluation by just measuring ourselves against exact inference. (Yes, this limits us to relatively small models with 10 or 20 binary nodes.) What do you think happens? Well, first, things vary as a function of the number of X nodes versus Z nodes in the graph. When most of the nodes are X (maximization) nodes, then max-product does best and EM basically does the same. Whe most of the nodes are Z (marginalization) nodes, then EM does best and sum-product does almost the same. But max product also does almost the same. This is an effect that we\'ve been seeing regularly, regardless of what the models look like (chains or lattices), what the potentials look like (high temperature or low temperature) and how you initialize these models (eg., in the chain case, EM converges to different places depending on initialization, while sum- and max-product do not). Max product is just unbeatable. In a sense, from a practical perspective, this is nice. It says: if you have a mixed model, just run max product and you\'ll do just as well as if you had done something more complicated (like EM). But it\'s also frustrating: we should be getting some leverage out of marginalizing over the nodes that we should marginalize over. Especially in the high temperature case, where there is lots of uncertainty in the model, max product should start doing worse and worse (note that when we evaluate, we only measure performance on the\'X\'nodes -- the\'Z\'nodes are ignored). Likening this back to K-means versus GMM, for the case where the models are the same (GMM restricted to not have priors or covariances), the analogy is that as far as the means go, it doesn\'t matter which one you use. Even if there\'s lots of uncertainty in the data. Of course, you may get much better assignments from GMM (or you may not, I don\'t really know). But if all you really care about at the end of the day are the Xs (the means), then our experience with max-product suggests that it just won\'t matter. At all. Ever. Part of me finds this hard to believe, and note that I haven\'t actually run experiments with K-means and GMM, but the results in the graphical model cases are sufficiently strong and reproducible that I\'m beginning to trust them. Shouldn\'t someone have noticed this before, though? For all the effort that\'s gone into various inference algorithms for graphical models, why haven\'t we ever noticed that you just can\'t beat max-product? (Yes, I\'m aware of some theoretical results, eg., the Wainwright result that sum-product + randomized rounding is a provably good approximation to the MAP assignment, but this result actually goes the other way, and contradicts many of our experimental studies where sum-product + rounding just flat out sucks. Maybe there are other results out there that we just haven\'t been able to dig up.)
There was a time early on in my days where I could jump out of bed and greet the world with tremendous vigor. There was a time early on in my life where my memory was sharp and clear. Now I get out of bed gently, slowly and greet the world with \'oh shit, my back\'. My memory loss is apparent whenever I meet someone for the first time and they give me their name, only for me to forget it 10 seconds into the conversation. Good Times  ..good times.
I don\'t know if it has something to do with all the medicine that I\'m on, or the fact asthma causes some degree of stress, or the fact that I\'m forced to be\'unique\'because of asthma, or due to anxiety, or sinus problems, or allergies, or wimpiness or what. But, I sometimes get these terrible headaches, and I have one right now. Actually I have dulled it with an Ultram, but it\'s still there. I woke up at 2 a.m. with this headache so bad there was no way I was going to go back to sleep, so I got up and took two 500 mg Tylenol. I have to take that much, because one never quite cuts it. I knew this was not a Tylenol headache, though. Yet I had to try it. I had to try something before I took an Ultram. I had to because once I take an Ultram, once it kicks in, I have to write. Doesn\'t that sound weird. Yep! Ultram relaxes me to the point, puts all these ideas in my head, and I have to put them on paper. I\'ve written some good stuff while on Ultram. Ultram dulls or gets rid of my headaches no matter how bad, it\'s the first drug I have ever taken that gives me at least some degree of relief. However, even though it is not an opiate, and my doctor says it\'s safe to use it and work, it gives me the feeling that about three cups of coffee gives me, although without the side effects such as shakiness and such. It just makes me feel euphoric, and happy.
On Friday evening, I found the mother lode of pain located   conveniently enough   in my right wrist. The most intense episode lasted about an hour. When it passed, I proudly reminded myself about how such episodes in the past used to emotionally knock me down for days, which did not seem to be the case anymore. Sure, these episodes continue to be difficult to get through, but at least I seem to be a little more \'prepared\' for them. Yesterday afternoon, when I was at physical therapy, we once again reached the point where the maximum electrotherapy current was being delivered to my ankles, and I couldn\'t feel a thing. In the past, I used to break down right at that moment, as it served as a objective and stark reminder of exactly how much pain I was in. Yesterday, I held my head up high as I remembered this, and told myself that I would get through this episode as I have gotten through other episodes. Later during the day, I completely lost the use of my left hand for more than an hour. As luck would have it, this coincided with the time when we sat down to eat a meal. In the past, I would have have been reluctant to ask for help and would have instead struggled to cut my own food, resulting in even more pain. Yesterday, I calmly asked for help, and even through I am left-handed, I used my right hand to lift my fork. When a small glass of jello was served for dessert, I propped it up in between my knees and scooped it up with a spoon   without so much as a second thought. I once again felt proud of myself.
Over the past week I\'ve received a lot of recommendations for Keepers, so I thought I\'d kick things off by talking about one of my favorite cards: 1960 Leaf\'Baseball\'s Two Hal Smiths\'. It\'s on my Keeper List, and is a card I don\'t own. It\'s a Keeper because it isn\'t clear what the two Hal Smiths are doing in their photo. Are they negotiating over the bill? Are they diapering a baby? Because the background has been removed, context is missing (and desperately, desperately needed). These guys could be anywhere   a bus stop... a locker room... It\'s no secret, my love for 1960 Leaf (read my set review here). The photos are mug-shot bad, the cards themselves came packaged with marbles, and the design has a style aesthetic with as much pizzazz as checkerboard kitchen linoleum. But what it\'s lacking in visual appeal, it more than makes up for in awkwardness. Awkward halos behind each head. Awkward checklist including immortal baseball gods Stover McIlwain (out of the league since 1958), Marshall Renfroe (career = 1 game in 1959), and baseball\'s two Hal Smiths (one a journeyman, the other an All Star). And did I mention that the cards were awkwardly packaged with marbles? I understand that Topps had cornered the market on the cards and gum thing, but seriously, who came up with marbles? There\'s something about Hal Smith... both of him. I can\'t think of another time when two players shared the same name. (Wait a minute... Steve Ontiveros? Weren\'t there two of that guy?) I\'ve mentioned this already, but one Hal was a journeyman and the other Hal was an All Star. The All Star had a knack for showing up on his baseball cards in full catcher regalia; that is, toothily smiling through his mask in a creepy crouching position. I can think of at least two cards (1958 Topps and 1960 Topps) of him photographed like that. The journeyman was just ugly: pursed lips, narrowed eyes... it was as if he was a street-corner criminal scouting for the next fence. This one is also a Keeper for me because it\'s a combo card. But instead of Hal and Hal hamming it up under a corny line like\'Backstop Bu,\'ies\'or something, as Topps was wont to do throughout the Sixties, Sports Novelties kept it obvious, in a Ripley\'s Believe-it-or-Not informative kind of way. It\'s\'Baseball\'s Two Hal Smiths\'because that\'s who they are. In the end it matters not what they\'re doing, just that they appear together. That\'s why this one\'s a Keeper.
As most parents know, and as we\'re learning, once they start crawling and standing and exploring, the battle dominance and safety between parents and children over has only just begun. After over a month of putting it off, Tricia and I decided this morning (with Gwyneth\'s help) that our project over the weekend must be Gwyneth-proofing the house. Just this morning our fearless, diapered, red-kneed trouble maker rediscovered the cat food, learned how to open the kitchen cabinets and decided that a very tall study lamb had to be more fun parallel to the floor. So, we\'re off to Home Depot and Walmart to stock up. Got any tips, products, resources or creative battle strategies to share with us? Now\'s your chance to help us get starting with a victory!
 I couldn\'t read. I had no concept of time. I had no clue what baseball was. I didn\'t know the World Series existed before the Red Sox made it there in 1986. But stickers? Yeah, I kinda knew what stickers were. Stickers and I have enjoyed a love-love relationship my whole life. Dinosaur stickers begot robot stickers eventually begot Obey Giant stickers. So when I reached a certain collecting-and-knowing-what-baseball-was-age, stickers and I rekindled our love affair once more in the form of the Panini and Topps sticker books. I never completed my sticker albums, but I was always gung-ho. I just want to get all of this off my chest before I start down this long, sometimes dusty, but always sticky road. Initial Thoughts 1982 Topps Stickers. Man, that kid on the box is kind of creepy, isn\'t he? And yet, I\'d be as stoked as he obviously is if I was eight years old and embarking on a magnificent sticker-filled adventure. If we all agree for the moment that the kid on the box was around eight years old in 1982... he would be 36 today. Gary Carter is on the front of the album, and each page has a slightly obscured shadow portrait of a member of each team. What\'s creepy about this is that the eyes have been removed from each person, leaving somewhat anonymous baseball-playing zombies haunting the backgrounds of each page. Twenty cents for five stickers to a pack, which means the minimum a kid was spending to fill his or her album was (260 stickers/5= 52 unique packs) 52 x 20¢ = $10.40 (+ 25¢ for the album)... So a total of $10.65 to complete the album without ever getting a double. Not exactly chump change to a kid in 1982. So I\'ve armed myself with a complete, unopened box of stickers (100 packs), which was easier than expected to track down, and an unused sticker album. Let\'s get this sticker party started
You know, I want to be excited by this. It looks like they even got Marvin from Pulp Fiction. You know, the guy they accidently shoot and have to call Harvey Keitel to mop up the blood. Well, I don\'t see a credit for Back on Topps on his imdb.com page, but that really looks like him. I also like the reference to the\'cocaine out of a bread truck,\'though if we remember back to last year, I believe it was a Mr. Softee truck out in Jamaica, Queens, where the driver was selling cocaine on the side. (His trick? Double-cupping the sundaes. Ingenious.) So yeah, I want to get excited. But you know what would really get me jazzed on this series--and yes, I just said \'jazzed\', which hopefully came across in a completely non-sexual way, though now that I\'ve taken the energy to explain probably does come across as sexual--? I think you know... That\'s right: a re-occurring character who either appears in a dream sequence or within the wacky corporate world of Topps HQ who also happens to be on a mini Allen & Ginter card (or 1975 Topps Mini). Or is Lil\' Kwame Brown. This character would best be played by a real-life athlete, with his character name simply his real name with \'Baby\' or \'Lil\' in front of it. Like\'Baby Rafael Furcal\'or\'Lil\' Dmitri\'. Actually, that last one\'s not bad. Get Dmitri Young on the phone to play the Topps egghead archivist (who expounds on his love of gem mint cards and also happens to be trapped on a mini A & G card).
I take collation pretty seriously, mostly because I enjoy knowing what I\'m going to get once I know the top card (or sticker, as the case may be). For this box, if Tom Seaver was first out of the pack, your four others would be in this order: Jerry Remy, Dusty Baker, Mike Schmidt, and Vida Blue. Similarly, if you pulled Paul Molitor first, there was nearly a 100% chance that the third sticker would be Manny Trillo, the fourth sticker would be Bob Horner, and the second and fifth stickers would be random. Even the seemingly random-seeded stickers weren\'t seeded all that randomly. For instance, Andre Dawson was locked in the 1 hole, John Castino and Fred Lynn both 2\'s, John Mayberry a 3, Pete Rose Highlight a 4, and Cecil Cooper, Cliff Johnson, Dave Collins, and at least 18 others at 5. There were\'Rogue\'stickers as well, or those that didn\'t appear in a consistent slot (Keith Hernandez, Rollie Fingers League Leaders). And there, hi,\'en amongst the doubles, triples, rogues and locked rows were actual single print stickers   25 of them to be exact, including all five of the stickers from Pack 1. Amazing. Someone asked me today what my goal of this project was. I answered that I wanted to be able to hypothetically assemble an uncut sheet of stickers without knowing exactly where each sticker would have fit. And while that would be a neat exercise to actually do, the more I thought about individual box collation, pack cycles, and pack pockets, the more I realized that to make generalizations based a very small sample is at best unwise and at worst just plain stupid. I remember a few years ago when I started A Pack A Day, I ripped a box of 1989-90 Hoops Series One. I found that not only was the David Robinson draft-day rookie short print not actually short-printed, but I found that if you got it in a pack, you also got Larry Bird (I ended up getting about 4 of each from that one box). But while my experience tells me that the Robinson wasn\'t actually a short print, why is it always listed as a short print? Using my one-box example to make a generalization doesn\'t really work. There are reasons why card companies serial-number cards nowadays. For one thing, it creates a sense of a limited supply. For another thing, it completely destroys the idea of a general collation. Just because you get autographed relic card A doesn\'t mean you\'ll also get commons B, C, and D (well, unless the auto relics are considered Rogues, then that opens up whole new possibilities...). Of course, this is not true of regular card products. I\'d bet that Topps 2010 has just as poor collation as Topps 1986. In any event, if you can view a Google doc, you can take a look at my documented collation from my box of 1982 Topps Stickers.
My hands keep working pretty well when I\'m drinking. My ADHD mind is more problematic. I\'ve tried to avoid this, largely because I think that according to whatever code of scribal ethics I do, or should, observe, it\'s reprehensible. Nonetheless — and this might well have summat to do with my having read about one of my literary heroes, W.H. Auden, sitting in a dive bar on St. Mark\'s Place sucking down the VSOP all day long, no doubt fending off propositions from Ginsberg, writing away. I can\'t do it. I believe I\'ve made that clear. If I haven\'t, here\'s the dilly-o. My hands keep working pretty well when I\'m drinking. My ADHD mind is more problematic. Of course, my mind is problematic in the best of situations. I sure as hell can\'t control it. So it\'s snowing here in Gotham. It would be an excellent night to find a nice ginmill and spend the rest of the evening consuming a pride of beers and a couple of packs of Marlboros. Except for (1) I don\'t smoke any more and (2) even if I did, you can\'t light up in bars here in the city. There were a couple of pints in the refrigerator when I got home from tai chi, and they went fast, so I had a couple more. All to the good. I can feel the universe narrowing, feel my interest in my own thoughts burgeoning, and feel the external noise fading away. The thirst is far from satisfied, amigos. But that\'s it for tonight. I know where I stand, and where I\'d stand, or flop, if I had a couple more pints. Nowhere good, I assure you. The issue of creating, even on the abcedarian level at which I compose, and drinking is complex. It\'s like juggling sushi knives. One slip and you\'re not witty, you\'re exsanguinating. Remember the scene in Deer Hunter where Walken was playing Russian roulette? Not quite so severe, but a loss is a loss. So I\'ll be signing off now, chillin\' like Bob Dylan. When I review this tomorrow, I may have more to say.
Sometime in December I decided to find out how long it would take to put together a set by simply buying wax packs. Of course, the holidays were fast approaching, so this became a project for after the madness passed. And now here we are. A few days ago, I put out a message on Facebook/Twitter asking for help: Which set should I put together? The choices were 1981 Fleer, 1990 Topps, 1991 Topps, 1992 Upper Deck, 1994 Fleer, and a random 1980s Topps sticker set. I got a lot of response, mostly choosing a sticker set (5 votes), 1981 Fleer (2 votes), or 1990 Topps (2 votes). After much deliberation, here\'s the set I\'ll be aiming to complete: 1982 Topps Stickers. I chose 1982 because of the availability of unopened sticker packs and unused sticker albums. After I complete the sticker album, I will attempt to complete 1991 Topps, a set I never liked and never bought when it came out. After 1991 Topps, who knows. Here are the rules: No trading. No buying of opened lots on eBay. I will only buy packs. I also plan on tracking sticker/card sequencing in packs. I will then fill in each page of the sticker album as best I can. I still haven\'t figured out what to do with the sticker doubles, but I think some sort of public art around Boston will be on tap.
Hi all, It\'s been a while since my last post as not much has changed, i am still managing on 12.5mg Methotrexate weekly and 75mg Diclofenac daily, my last blood tests showed that i am still anaemic with low ferritin levels (as i think ive said before i just cannot tolerate the iron (Ferrous Sulphate) tablets), so i am now waiting for a date to have another endoscopy to check for ulcers which i ain\'t looking forward to. My joints are not too bad at the moment on the lower Methotrexate dose although my skin is creeping up again. I hope everyone is bearing up and ok, all the best
In my view, this is a step in the wrong direction. The tax on so-called Cadillac health plans made sense as a way to reduce the existing tax incentive toward excessively generous health insurance, which in turn encourages excessive use of healthcare. That reform is, apparently, now gone. Instead, the current administration proposal is to increase the tax on capital income, reducing the incentive for saving and investment. In other words, the new proposal would do less to bend the curve of rising healthcare costs and more to impede long-run economic growth. This change was probably made to attract more House Democrats. It will likely make the plan even less attractive to congressional Republicans. By the way, according to CBO director Doug Elmendorf, the new administration proposal has too few details for the CBO to provide cost estimates. Perhaps more details will be available in the days to come.
Jane went to see the psychiatrist today with a friend. She wrote out an agenda of questions for discussion but he was bemused by it. He thought he ought to have all the answers but didn\'t have an answer to one of them. He seemed not to understand that they were points for discussion rather than direct questions of him. He was frightened that he didn\'t have the answers. He was even more frightened that he didn\'t understand the questions. Jane was yet even more frightened that he didn\'t understand the questions. He felt\'got at\'because of this ... but it was a genuine attempt to have a multi-disciplinary discussion. As the team leader, surely he should feel competent in this? Their ward rounds are described as multi-disciplinary team meetings. But he didn\'t feel confident. He could talk about medication, leave and risk assessments; anything else sent him into a panic or denial. Consultant psychiatrists in the NHS are not used to being questioned or having to substantiate what they are doing. They expect deference and in return do what the ward staff ask of them. It is four weeks since he suggested he wanted a second opinion for Sam. He has done nothing since then. When Jane discussed this with him he suggested a name for the second opinion. We have Googled him and he is an expert in\'Schizophrenia\', in medication and in treatment resistance. He has written papers about the a,\'itional medication that Sam\'s psychiatrist wants to introduce. What is the point in getting a true second opinion from someone whose background is such that they are almost certain to support what Sam\'s psychiatrist intended to do in the first place? We have been very polite with him so far. Perhaps it was good to have made him squirm a little today ... Though on previous occasions this has often had negative outcomes.
It\'s difficult enough for my ADHD brain to remember what I\'m doing, let alone what five or six other mooks are up to. I was diligently studying Latin; OK, I was watching some tournament poker over the weekend when I realized that in a treating ADHD blog post last week I\'d discussed the hardships an ADHDan faced when playing cards. My point was that given our ADHD impaired memories, we were at a gross disadvantage, since being able to recall the cards which had been played was critical to all but the most casual levels of gaming. True enough, but not the whole story. First of all, it\'s not just the cards that a good player remembers, but the other players. Poker players speak of a player having a\'tell,\'some behavioral tic that he replicates in direct response to a given set of circumstances. For example, a player who\'s bluffing may sit there scratching at his ear, or drumming his fingers on the table (these are exceptionally overt mannerisms, but for our current purposes they\'ll serve). Given a good hand, the same player may sit as serenely as a lama, or carefully arrange his chips in even stacks. This information only comes from constant observation and analysis, watching the actions of one\'s competitors and linking them to the situation that eventually reveals itself. Like all data recording, the value of these observations increases in direct proportion to their quantity and accuracy. And then, of course, one has to remember this stuff. There\'s no benefit to an\'AHA!\'moment, the realization that another player has just moved his glasses to the top of his head, or has started to suck on an ice cube, unless you can recall what he held the last time he did so. I\'ve come to terms with this, and that\'s why I don\'t play cards any more. It\'s difficult enough for me to remember what I\'m doing, let alone what five or six other mooks are up to. And that\'s not even allowing for the possibility that they\'ve totally fabricated a tell, and are planning on trotting it out, blatantly, at a critical moment, probably when you\'re trying to decide whether or not to go all-in. Sucker. PS: If don\'t think you have any tells, think again. All but the very best players exhibit them, and if you\'re reading this, Slick, you\'re certainly not in that category.
Jane decided to attend the ward round meeting earlier this week. We had been to the planning meeting only a couple of weeks earlier. But of course, yet again, things change so quickly that there is a need for a short term response and the longer term plan can be quickly forgotten. We wanted to emphasise our thanks to the staff for the fact that they were still being positive with Sam and with us while things have been difficult. Also we wanted to suggest that there needed to be a major input of some sort in terms of psychological and therapeutic support to try to get Sam over this blip. They started though by trying very hard to reassure Jane that they had no intentions of trying to move Sam elsewhere. Jane must have mentioned this. It is a real fear. It has happened everywhere else. They are so used to\'improvement\'in their behavioural sense with the possibility of patients moving on. When an initial improvement leads ultimately to further decline they are at a loss and eager to move him on before it becomes apparent or because they do not know want to do next. Sam is now on a forensic ward. Where does he go from here if they can\'t cope? But only a few weeks ago on Christmas Day Sam and the family enjoyed a lovely day together. So it can go well for him and us. How do we get back on the upward spiral? So they were trying hard to reassure Jane of this. Then they started to talk of medication. They see a need for change. They do not understand him. He seems to be outside their experience. Usually on Clozapine patients do so well ... Sam has been there for eighteen months now. This is the second time he has been on Clozapine. Both times he has been taken to hospital with physical health concerns. So what do they propose now? More psychological and therapeutic support? No ...
I had severe carpal tunnel syndrome and was headed straight under the knife, but truly didnt want surgewry... A friend told me about a \'platelet injection\' made from your own blood.. i as sceptical & the pain doc in denton, tx told me it was purely experimental but it worked!!.. within a few weeks my pain deminished to the point i didnt notice it or didnt have it anymore. I cant say this is the answer for everyone.. but it surely worked for me :) Best of luck to you friend!
Once your application gets to the hiring committee, the hope is that they\'ve already heard of you. But if they haven\'t, hopefully they\'ve heard of at least one of your letter writers. When we get applications, I typically first sort by whether I\'ve heard of the applicant, then by the number of letter writers they have that I\'ve heard of, then loosely by the reputation of their university. And I make my way down the list, not always all the way to the bottom. (Okay, I\'ve only done this once, and I think I got about 90% of the way through.) In my experience, what we\'ve looked for in applications is (a) a good research statement, including where you\'re going so as to distinguish yourself from your advisor, (b) a not-bad teaching statement (it\'s hard to get a job at a research university on a great teaching statement, but it\'s easy to lose an offer on a bad one... my feeling here is just to be concrete and not to pad it with BS -- if you don\'t have much to say, don\'t say much), (c) great letters, and (d) an impressive CV. You should expect that the hiring committee will read some of your papers before interviewing you. This means that if you have dozens, you should highlight somewhere (probably the research statement) what are they best ones that they should read. Otherwise they\'ll choose essentially randomly, and (depending on your publishing style) this could hurt. As always, put your best foot forward and make it easy for the hiring committee to find out what\'s so great about you. Anyway, that\'s basically it. There\'s lots more at interview stage, but these are my feelings for application stage. I\'d be interested to hear if my characterization of the hiring process is vastly different than at other universities; plus, if there are other openings that might be relevant to NLP/ML folks, I\'m sure people would be very pleased to seem them in the comments section. Good luck, all your graduating folks!
Back in 2003, the popular rumor in Boston was that the Red Sox, White Sox, and Rangers were going to put together a three-team trade that would send Manny Ramirez to Texas, Nomar Garciaparra to Chicago, and Magglio Ordonez and Alex Rodriguez to Boston. Nobody knows for sure what would\'ve happened had that trade gone through, but for a minute or two there I could see A-Rod and Ordonez in Sox uniforms. There have been other players whom I thought would end up on the Sox one way or another (To,\' Helton is at the top of that list), but one guy I never saw on the Red Sox was Fred McGriff. Maybe it\'s because I was raised on the Lou Gorman-led Sox (\'What would we do with Willie McGee?\'), but the Sox already had Mo Vaughn at first. What would we have done with Fred McGriff? My grandfather grew up in a small town in South Dakota. His sisters were the switchboard operators for the town, and his father the postman and local semi-pro baseball team manager. He likes to tell the story of how, towards the end of one season, his father lured a star pitcher away from a rival team. And then, instead of pitching him in the big games that followed, kept him on the bench. When asked why he would do that, my grandfather laughs and says that his dad had the luxury of not using the star pitcher--as long as he wasn\'t pitching for the other team. And when the A-Rod and Ordonez trades fell through, what did the Yankees do? Did they say\'Why do we need A-Rod when we already have Derek Jeter?\'This is one of those little things that we with the Lou Gorman mindset never figure out: having Mo Vaughn at first and Fred McGriff, be it at DH or lounging on the bench, perhaps could\'ve pushed the Sox closer to the pennant. Instead we defensively scoff at even considering the possibility.
Greetings from the President of the United States.\' That\'s what it said when my draft notice came in the mail, a couple of wars ago. But instead of thinking about how hard it would be to leave my family and friends for months, or years, I had another thought that ping-ponged around inside my head. What to do with my beloved and pampered 1965 Mustang? It was just too dear to my heart to part with, and I didn\'t dare leave it for my parents to drive—or worse yet, my little brother. It would just have to be pickled, and put up on blocks for the duration. That was a long time ago, and I wish I had done a better job of preserving that car, so I could drive it today. Yes, I miss that Mustang. There are lots of men and women serving in our armed forces around the globe. And I receive plenty of mail from them asking me how they should store their cars while they are overseas. The rules of vehicular cold storage are the same no matter why the car is left behind. But storage isn\'t always kind to vehicles. Corrosion and decay take their toll on engines, bodies and interiors. Time itself can ruin tires, and even a car stored inside a garage can attract some unwanted furry house guests. Here\'s how to protect and store your car, truck or motorcycle—the right way. Store or Sell? Unless there\'s something very special about a particular car, I don\'t suggest placing a car in storage for more than a year. Special-interest and collector cars, like that 1966 Vette or antique Hispano-Suiza, might tug on your heartstrings (and purse strings) enough to keep them in the family, but anything that qualifies as practical daily transportation, no matter how nice it is, should be sold. You can replace it with another car when you\'re in need of a vehicle again. The loss in value of a car that accrues in another year from its manufacture, even if the odometer doesn\'t see any more miles, is too high. One option for shorter-term situations is to simply keep the car on the road. Find some responsible adult who will drive the car every two or three weeks for an hour or more. This will keep the drivetrain lubricated and the battery charged. An engine that doesn\'t run regularly collects moisture and internal rust, especially on the portions of the cylinder walls not covered by the pistons, valves, camshafts and valve springs. Ditto for the brake discs, which are made from easy-to-rust cast iron. A car that\'s driven far enough to get completely warm and remain that way for an hour or more will drive off the moisture, coat any lubricated surfaces with oil again, and sweep the rust off the discs before they start to pit. And keep your insurance active: In some states, dropping your car insurance, even if you\'re not going to be driving, will make it nearly impossible or very expensive to get insurance again when you\'re ready. Check with your insurance agent; he may be able to reduce your coverage or transfer it to some less expensive option. At the very least, you\'ll want theft and vandalism coverage—just in case.
It has been a while since my last post. These long breaks are becoming more frequent and I\'m not quite sure why. My life is probably no more hectic than some of yours, so for me to make excuses would be completely reckless. Many of you may have known that I have been in the media business for many years, and about 5 years ago I partnered with someone to open our own media sales organization. It was an exciting time for me and I\'m glad that I did it. We had made significant progress over the years, but at the same time I felt it wasn\'t significant enough for me to continue in the partnership. I recently decided to hand the operations over to my partner and the other two companies that we had formed a relationship with. It was time for me to move on. I was hired four weeks ago by our local Fox Network affiliate, Sinclair Broadcasting Group, the largest independent broadcasting company in the country. It has been a crazy few weeks, but things are really starting to fall into place. I am excited for our future and will try and keep all of you posted on our progress. The kids are in school and once again we are pleased with the curriculum. Robin is doing extremely well in her classes to become a PA. I keep on telling myself that she\'ll only be in school for two more years thinking that it may calm me down a bit. It doesn\'t work. I\'m sure that once we find our rhythm, things will fall into the proper place.
I have started going to School 3 days a week for about 3 hours now. I am now 17 years old. People say I have got better at speaking to people but I dont think so, I still get as nervous maybe even more. My Brother Adam now takes me out 3 times a week now for a couple of hours so im a lot busier than before. If youn want any advice or anything about Autism comment if you want. Once Someone called me a professional about autism but im not, I will still try to help if i can.
Ellen Riloff and I run an NLP reading group pretty much every semester. Last semester we covered\'old school NLP.\'We independently came up with lists of what we consider some of the most important ideas (idea = paper) from pre-1990 (most are much earlier) and let students select which to present. There was a lot of overlap between Ellen\'s list and mine (not surprisingly). If people are interested, I can provide the whole list (just post a comment and I\'ll dig it up). The whole list of topics is posted as a comment. The topics that were actually selected are here. I hope the students have found this exercise useful. It gets you thinking about language in a way that papers from the 2000s typically do not. It brings up a bunch of issues that we no longer think about frequently. Like language. (Joking.) (Sort of.) One thing that\'s really stuck out for me is how much\'old school\'NLP comes across essentially as a study of representations. Perhaps this is a result of the fact that AI -- as a field -- was (and, to some degree, still is) enamored with knowledge representation problems. To be more concrete, let\'s look at a few examples. It\'s already been a while since I read these last (I had meant to write this post during the spring when things were fresh in my head), so please forgive me if I goof a few things up. I\'ll start with one I know well: Mann and Thompson\'s rhetorical structure theory paper from 1988. This is basically\'the\'RST paper. I think that when a many people think of RST, they think of it as a list of ways that sentences can be organized into hierarchies. Eg., this sentence provides background for that one, and together they argue in favor of yet a third. But this isn\'t really where RST begins. It begins by trying to understand the communicative role of text structure. That is, when I write, I am trying to communicate something. Everything that I write (if I\'m writing\'well\') is toward that end. For instance, in this post, I\'m trying to communicate that old school NLP views representation as the heart of the issue. This current paragraph is supporting that claim by providing a concrete example, which I am using to try to convince you of my claim. As a more detailed example, take the\'Evidence\'relation from RST. M+T have the following characterization of\'Evidence.\'Herein,\'N\'is the nucleus of the relation,\'S\'is the satellite (think of these as sentences),\'R\'is the reader and\'W\'is the writer:
The rest of this post are random thoughts that occurred to me at NIPS. Maybe some of them will get other people\'s wheels turning? This was originally an email I sent to my students, but I figured I might as well post it for the world. But forgive the lack of capitalization :): persi diaconis\' invited talk about reinforcing random walks... that is, you take a random walk, but every time you cross an edge, you increase the probability that you re-cross that edge (see coppersmith + diaconis, rolles + diaconis).... this relates to a post i had a while ago: nlpers.blogspot.com/2007/04/multinomial-on-graph.html ... i\'m thinking that you could set up a reinforcing random walk on a graph to achieve this. the key problem is how to compute things -- basically want you want is to know for two nodes i,j in a graph and some n >= 0, whether there exists a walk from i to j that takes exactly n steps. seems like you could craft a clever data structure to answer this question, then set up a graph multinomial based on this, with reinforcement (the reinforcement basically looks like the a,\'itive counts you get from normal multinomials)... if you force n=1 and have a fully connected graph, you should recover a multinomial/dirichlet pair. also from persi\'s talk, persi and some guy sergei (sergey?) have a paper on variable length markov chains that might be interesting to look at, perhaps related to frank wood\'s sequence memoizer paper from icml last year. finally, also from persi\'s talk, steve mc_something from ohio has a paper on using common gamma distributions in different rows to set dependencies among markov chains... this is related to something i was thinking about a while ago where you want to set up transition matrices with stick-breaking processes, and to have a common, global, set of sticks that you draw from... looks like this steve mc_something guy has already done this (or something like it). not sure what made me think of this, but related to a talk we had here a few weeks ago about unit tests in scheme, where they basically randomly sample programs to\'hope\'to find bugs... what about setting this up as an RL problem where your reward is high if you\'re able to find a bug with a\'simple\'program... something like 0 if you don\'t find a bug, or 1/|P| if you find a bug with program P. (i think this came up when i was talking to percy -- liang, the other one -- about some semantics stuff he\'s been looking at.) afaik, no one in PL land has tried ANYTHING remotely like this... it\'s a little tricky because of the infinite but discrete state space (of programs), but something like an NN-backed Q-learning might do something reasonable :P. i also saw a very cool\'survey of vision\'talk by bill freeman... one of the big problems they talked about was that no one has a good p(image) prior model. the example given was that you usually have de-noising models like p(image)*p(noisy image|image) and you can weight p(image) by ^alpha... as alpha goes to zero, you should just get a copy of your noisy image... as alpha goes to infinity, you should end up getting a good image, maybe not the one you *want*, but an image nonetheless. this doesn\'t happen. one way you can see that this doesn\'t happen is in the following task. take two images and overlay them. now try to separate the two. you *clearly* need a good prior p(image) to do this, since you\'ve lost half your information. i was thinking about what this would look like in language land. one option would be to take two sentences and randomly interleave their words, and try to separate them out. i actually think that we could solve this tasks pretty well. you could probably formulate it as a FST problem, backed by a big n-gram language model. alternatively, you could take two DOCUMENTS and randomly interleave their sentences, and try to separate them out. i think we would fail MISERABLY on this task, since it requires actually knowing what discourse structure looks like. a sentence n-gram model wouldn\'t work, i don\'t think. (although maybe it would? who knows.) anyway, i thought it was an interesting thought experiment. i\'m trying to think if this is actually a real world problem... it reminds me a bit of a paper a year or so ago where they try to do something similar on IRC logs, where you try to track who is speaking when... you could also do something similar on movie transcripts. hierarchical topic models with latent hierarchies drawn from the coalescent, kind of like hdp, but not quite. (yeah yeah i know i\'m like a parrot with the coalescent, but it\'s pretty freaking awesome :P.) That\'s it! Hope you all had a great holiday season, and enjoy your New Years (I know I\'m going skiing. A lot. So there, Fernando! :)).
Is it the scripty names? The low budget headshots? The blue outlines for American Leaguers and red for National? What is it about this set that makes this grown man swoon? I\'ll tell you what. It\'s cheap. Super cheap, in fact. I may be blowing my cover here, but arm yourself with the right reference guides and you can buy the rare ones for practically nothin\' from the rubes on eBay. It\'s a good-looking set, too. Clean lines, small Post logo, real team insignia and uniforms  none of that crap from the Eighties and Nineties, after Major League Baseball a,\'ed a (TM) to everything and made it so the third-parties didn\'t want to pay the licensing fees. And this one\'s an old set, and a short one, too. Just 200 cards. And did I mention it\'s cheap? If you\'re looking for a fun, ground-floor set to get in on, make it a Post Cereal set from the 1960s. I chose 1962. It\'s got unexpected rarities (like Jerry Lynch), big names that are relatively easy to find, two versions of the Mantle and Maris cards, a host of errors, and the wonderful phenomenon of the hand-cut card. Ah yes, the joys of cutting your own cards! I remember a certain Will Clark card I cut off the back of a Drake\'s Cakes when I was 9 years old. It had more angles and jagged edges than a rectangle is supposed to have... Unless you had steady surgeon\'s hands or had a parent do the work, you got a ragged piece of cardboard. But that\'s the fun of it. Besides, who wanted to wait for a parent? I needed that Will Clark card in my grubby stack of cards now! And no matter where you find these early-Sixties Post cards, be it in the dime bin at a show or a ten-dollar lot on eBay, they are always a bit ragged. Sure, being born of cereal-box-grade cardboard didn\'t help (feels a bit flimsier than standard Topps baseball cards of the day), but it\'s the knowledge that kids in the Sixties were every bit as impatient to get at their cards as I was, twenty-five years later, that puts this set on a higher plane. So goodnight, you backs of cereal boxes, you hand-cut kings of nostalgia.
This is what I mean by small changes (to the input) begetting good example. A slightly transformed zero is still a zero. Of course, you have to be careful. If you rotate a six by 180 degrees, you get a nine. If you rotate a cat by 180 degrees, you get an unhappy cat. More seriously, if you\'re brave, you might start looking at a class of transformations called diffeomorphisms, which are fairly popular around here. These are nice because of their nice mathematical properties, but un-nice because they can be slightly too flexible for certain problems. Now, let\'s go over to NLP land. Do we ever futz with our inputs? Sure! In language modeling, we\'ll sometimes permute words or replace one word with another to get a negative example. Noah Smith futzed with his inputs in contrastive estimation to produce negative examples by swapping adjacent words, or deleting words. In fact, try as I might, I cannot think of a single case in NLP where we make small changes to an input to get another good input: we always do it to get a bad input! In a sense, this means that one thing that vision people have that we don\'t have is a notion of semantics preserving transformations. Sure, linguists (especially those from that C-guy) study transformations. And there\'s a vague sense that work in paraphrasing leads to transformations that maintain semantic equivalence. But the thing is that we really don\'t know any transformations that preserve semantics. Moreover, some transformations that seem benign (eg., passivization) actually are not: one of my favorite papers at NAACL this year by Greene and Resnik showed that syntactic structure affects sentiment (well, them, drawing on a lot of psycholinguistics work)! I don\'t have a significant point to this story other than it\'s kind of weird. I mentioned this to some people at ICML and got a reaction that replacing words with synonyms should be fine. I remember doing this in high school, when word processors first started coming with thesauri packed in. The result seemed to be that if I actually knew the word I was plugging in, life was fine... but if not, it was usually a bad replacement. So this seems like something of a mixed bag: depending on how liberal you are with defining\'synonym\'you might be okay do this, but you might also not be.
Arrived home from work this evening to a letter from the hospital. I\'ve just had my monthly blood test and I immediately thought it might be a recall for another test because my numbers were high. Or low. But no. The letter reads: \'An appointment has been made for you to see Rheumatology Nurse All Grades or a member of the team\'. And that\'s it. No explanation. No reason given. I\'m not even asked if I\'d like an appointment, or whether one can be arranged that\'s mutually convenient to me and \'Nurse All Grades\' or the NAG as I\'ll now think of them / it. Am I alone in thinking this is a bit rude? I don\'t get summoned without explanation by my dentist, or my optician, or my vet (well, not my vet, the cats\' vet, but you see what I mean). I feel like giving them a piece of my mind but I fear I\'ve few enough pieces left for myself. I\'ll give them a call. I\'m sure there\'s a good reason.
Okay, so this list is all food. But frankly, what else are you going to do here? Go to malls? :). There\'s definitely nice architecture to be seen; I would recommend the Mosque off of Arab street; of course you have to go to the Esplanade (the durian-looking building); etc. You can see a few photos from my last trip here. Now, I realize that most of the above list is not particularly friendly to my happy cow friends. Here\'s a list of restaurants that happy cow provides. There are quite a few vegetarian options, probably partially because of the large Muslim population here. There aren\'t as many vegan places, but certainly enough. For the vegan minded, there is a good blog about being vegan in Singapore (first post is about a recent local talk by Campbell, the author of The China Study, which I recommend everyone at least reads). I can\'t vouch for the quality of these places, but here\'s a short list drawn from Living Vegan: Mushroom hotpot at Ling Zhi Fried fake meat udon noodles (though frankly I\'m not a big fan of fake meat) Green Pasture cafe; looks like you probably have to be a bit careful here in terms of what you order Yes Natural; seems like it has a bunch of good options Lotus Veg restaurant, seems to have a bunch of dim sum (see here, too) If you must, there\'s pizza And oh-my-gosh, there\'s actually veggie chicken rice, though it doesn\'t seem like it holds up to the same standards as real chicken rice (if it did, that would be impressive) Okay, you can find more for yourself if you go through their links :). Enjoy your time here! Quick update: Totally forgot about coffee. If you need your espresso kick, Highlander coffee (49 Kampong Bahru Road) comes the most recommended, but is a bit of a hike from the conference area. Of course, you could also try the local specialty: burnt crap with condensed milk (lots and lots of discussion especially on page two here).
I\'m not sure how to help you catch up with events since my last post. It\'s not that there have been lots of\'events\'- just phone calls, visits, conversations, elation and despair. Just the usual really. It is just the up and down ... and the down and up. Jane\'s spoken on the phone with the psychiatrist who was covering last week - who seemed very good and took on board our feelings that it was important to get Sam out. Jane also bumped into the ward manager when delivering Sam his fix of tobacco and reinforced this message yet again. So they gave him leave - just around the grounds (ie the car park) with two members of staff escorting him. But at least it happened. And he\'s played football two days running in\'the hard area\'(or\'cage\'as we describe it.) We visited on Saturday and were able to walk around the grounds with Sam - and of course two staff. But he was fine. The more it works well the more they will see it is okay again and we can get back onto the upward spiral. But tomorrow we have a CPA meeting - a regular planning meeting. After making a fuss about asking for a copy of his last plan, the minutes of the last meeting and reports for the next meeting we finally got a copy of the last plan. They had some trouble tracking it down. It clearly wasn\'t a working document then was it ... ?
Forget the cards for a second. That\'s right, I want to trade this Harry Caray bobblehead to you. But here\'s what you have to do: You have to offer me a better trade than anyone else. My Keeper List is available to view (see link in sidebar at right), but don\'t let that hold you back. You want to trade me $80 in first class postage? How about a signed and numbered Dan McCarthy print? Or a few rare souvenir postcard folders? Here\'s what I know about this bobblehead: 1) It was made in 2002 by Bosley Bobbers 2) It\'s still in its original box 3) The box says it\'s a limited edition 4) It currently retails for $79.95 on eBay (link) 5) I don\'t know where I got it Here\'s what you should do if you want to a,\' this bobblehead to your collection: email me with your trade idea. The best idea will get Harry and his enormous glasses, bobbling for all eternity.
If NP Bayes had its way on this problem (or at least if the standard models I\'m familiar with had their way), they would memorize\'talk\'->\'talked\'and\'look\'->\'looked\'and so on because they\'re so familiar. Sure, it would still memorize the exceptions, but it would also memorize the really common\'rule cases too... why? Because of course it could fall back to the parametric model, but these are so common that the standard models would really like to take advantage of the rich-get-richer phenomenon on things like DPs, thus saving themselves cost by memorizing a new\'cluster\'for each common word. (Okay, this is just my gut feeling about what such models would do, but I think it\'s at least defensible.) Yes, you could turn the DP\'alpha\'parameter down, but I guess I\'m just not convinced this would do the right thing. Maybe I should just implement such a beast but, well, this is a blog post, not a *ACL paper :P. Take as an alternative example the language modeling stuff. Basically what it says is\'if you have enough data to substantiate memorizing a 5 gram, you should probably memorize a 5 gram.\'But why? If you could get the same effect with a 2 or 3 gram, why waste the storage/time?! I guess you could argue\'your prior is wrong,\'which is probably true for most of these models. In which case I guess the question is\'what prior does what I want?\'I don\'t have a problem with rich get richer -- in fact, I think it\'s good in this case. I also don\'t have a problem with a logarithmic growth rate in the number of exceptions (though I\'d be curious how this holds up empirically -- in general, I\'m a big fan of checking if your prior makes sense; for instance, Figure 3 (p16) of my supervised clustering paper). I just don\'t like the notion of memorizing when you don\'t have to.
I had a great idea a few years back: get baseball players and other celebrities to autograph my high school yearbook. How cool would it be to open your yearbook and have, amongst notes from your old friends, Fred McGriff\'s autograph? Or a \'Best Wishes\' from Jonathan Franzen? I\'m all about autographs in unexpected places. If I weren\'t so shy in real life I\'d do it. Or at least have an autograph book, filled with neighbors and other people I\'ve met. McGriff hit 34 home runs in the strike-shortened 1994 season. He was on pace for 48, had the season gone the full 162 games.
I\'ve been lucky all my life to have doctors who pretty much let me do what I want. While I\'ve had pharmacists question my inhaler use in the past, I have never had a doctor tell me to quit using it so much. Now I\'m not saying my doctors aren\'t concerned, just that I\'ve been fortunate to have doctors that understand that not all asthmatics fit into the\'guidelines.\'Sure most asthmatics shouldn\'t need to use their rescue inhaler more often than once or twice in a two week period, but some asthmatics -- like me and perhaps you -- need it more often. I wrote about how I was a bronchodilatoraholic (well, I suppose, once you\'re a bronchodilatoraholic you always are) once or twice on my other blogs, and I have had people email me to tell me my asthma is out of control if I use it as much as I claim. When, in fact, my asthma is controlled. Thus, rescue inhaler frequency isn\'t always an indicator of asthma control.
Purge update. There\'s no turning back. Those of you who want to trade with me or want some of my cards, email me and we\'ll figure something out. Also, two nights ago I started listing cards on eBay. You can follow my auctions here. Last night I posted three lots of 1959 Topps Venezuelan, nine cards total. Almost immediately, they all sold at the\'buy it now\'price. If you\'re interested in Venezuelan cards, I have about 20 from 1960 and 16 from 1966, in various conditions, with Hall of Famers, stars of the day, rookies, Yankees, Dodgers, and commons. Also this weekend, I\'ll be posting a whole bunch of lots from the 1970s, as well as going through and putting together a 1986 Topps set, then giving away all the doubles. If you\'re in the Brookline/Boston area and have a hankering for 1986 Topps baseball cards, drop me a line before I drop them on Craigslist. The Keeper List update. As part of The Epiphany, I\'m putting together a list of Keepers. What makes a card a Keeper? It\'s a card I have a favorable gut reaction to, if that makes any sense. For me the holy quintet of baseball cards is 1953 Topps Ed Mathews, 1954 Topps O\'Brien Brothers, 1958 Topps Stan Musial All-Star, 1959 Topps Roy Campanella\'Symbol of Courage\'and 1972 Topps Roberto Clemente. These are cards I\'d consider framing, cards that transcend their subjects, cards that I consider artwork. Of course there are others: 1978 Topps E,\'ie Murray, 1986 Donruss Jose Canseco, 1987 Topps Bo Jackson to name a few. This is a work in progress, but you can follow that progress by viewing the Keeper List here. If you\'d like to trade with me, these are the cards I\'m interested in obtaining. This weekend I\'m going to start posting more about The Purge in earnest. But I\'m serious, if you want to trade with me or you just plain want some of my cards, email me.
Arxiv is something of an underutilized resource in computer science. Indeed, many computer scientists seems not to even know it exists, despite it having been around for two decades now! On the other hand, it is immensely popular among (some branches of) mathematics and physics. This used to strike me as o,\': arxiv is a computer service, why haven\'t computer scientists jumped on it. Indeed, I spent a solid day a few months ago putting all my (well almost all my) papers on arxiv. One can always point to\'culture\'for such things, but I suspect there are more rational reasons why it hasn\'t affected us as much as it has others. I ran in to arxiv first when I was in math land. The following is a cartoon view of how (some branches of) math research gets published: Authors write a paper Authors submit paper to a journal Authors simultaneously post paper on arxiv Journal publishes (or doesn\'t publish) paper We can contrast this with how life goes in CS land: Conference announces deadline One day before deadline, authors write a paper Conference publishes (or rejects) paper I think there are a few key differences that matter. Going up to the mathematician model, we can ask ourselves, why do they do #3? It\'s a way to get the results out without having to wait for a journal to come back with a go/no-go response. Basically in the mathematician model, arxiv is used for advertising while a journal is used for a stamp of approval (or correctness). So then why don\'t we do arxiv too? I think there are two reasons. First, we think that conference turn around is good enough -- we don\'t need anything faster. Second, it completely screws up our notions of blind review. If everyone simultaneously posted a paper on arxiv when submitting to a conference, we could no longer claim, at all, to be blind. (Please, I beg of you, do not start commenting about blind review versus non-blind review -- I hate this topic of conversation and it never goes anywhere!) Basically, we rely on our conferences to do both advertising and stamp of approval. Of course, the speed of conferences is mitigated by the fact that you sometimes have to go through two or three before your paper gets in, which can make it as slow, or slower than, journals. In a sense, I think that largely because of the blind thing, and partially because conferences tend to be faster than journals, the classic usage of arxiv is not really going to happen in CS. (There\'s one other potential use for arxiv, which I\'ll refer to as the tech-report effect. I\'ve many times seen short papers posted on people\'s web pages either as tech-reports or as unpublished documents. I don\'t mean tutorial like things, like I have, but rather real semi-research papers. These are papers that contain a nugget of an idea, but for which the authors seem unwilling to go all the way to\'make it work.\'One could imagine posting such things on arxiv. Unfortunately, I really dislike such papers. It\'s very much a\'flag planting\'move in my opinion, and it makes life difficult for people who follow. That is, if I have an idea that\'s in someone elses semi-research paper, do I need to cite them? Ideas are a dime a dozen: making it work is often the hard part. I don\'t think you should get to flag plant without going through the effort of making it work. But that\'s just me.) However, there is one prospect that arxiv could serve that I think would be quite valuable: literally, as an archive. Right now, ACL has the ACL anthology. UAI has its own repository. ICML has a rather sad state of affairs where, from what I can tell, papers from ICML #### are just on the ICML #### web page and if that happens to go down, oh well. All of these things could equally well be hosted on arxiv, which has strong government support to be sustained, is open access, blah blah blah. This brings me to a question for you all: how would you feel if all (or nearly all) ICML papers were to be published on arxiv? That is, if your paper is accepted, instead of uploading a camera-ready PDF to the ICML conference manager website, you instead uploaded to arxiv and then sent your arxiv DOI link to the ICML folks?
This post is a bit of a historical retrospective, because it\'s only been recently that these things have aligned themselves in my head. The all goes back to Jyrki Kivenen and Manfred Warmuth\'s paper on exponentiated gradient descent that dates back to STOC 1995. For those who haven\'t read this paper, or haven\'t read it recently, it\'s a great read (although it tends to repeat itself a lot). It\'s particularly interesting because they derive gradient descent and exponentiated gradient descent (GD and EG) as a consequence of other assumptions. In particular, suppose we have an online learning problem, where at each time step we receive an example x, make a linear prediction (w\'x) and then suffer a loss. The idea is that if we suffer no loss, then we leave w as is; if we do suffer a loss, then we want to balance two goals: Change w enough so that we wouldn\'t make this error again Don\'t change w too much The key question is how to define\'too much.\'Suppose that we measure changes in w by looking at Euclidean distance between the updated w and the old w. If we work through the math for enforcing 1 while minimizing 2, we derive the gradient descent update rule that\'s been used for optimizing, eg., perceptrons for squared loss for ages. The magic is what happens if we use something other than Euclidean distance. If, instead, we assume that the ws are all positive, we can use an (unnormalized) KL divergence to measure differences between weight vectors. Doing this leads to multiplicative updates, or the exponentiated gradient algorithm. (Obvious (maybe?) open question: what happens if you replace the distance with some other divergence, say a Bregman, or alpha or phi-divergence?) This line of thinking leads naturally to Crammer et al.\'s work on Online Passive Aggressive algorithms, from JMLR 2006. Here, the idea remains the same, but instead of simply ensuring that we make a correct classification, ala rule (1) above, we ensure that we make a correct classification with a margin of at least 1. They use Euclidean distance to measure the difference in weight vectors, and, for many cases, can get closed-form updates that look GD-like, but not exactly GD. (Aside: what happens if you use, eg., KL instead of Euclidean?) Two years later, Mark Dredze, Koby Crammer and Fernando Pereira presented Confidence-Weighted Linear Classification. The idea here is the same: don\'t change the weight vectors too much, but achieve good classification. The insight here is to represent weight vectors by distributions over weight vectors, and the goal is to change these distributions enough, but not too much. Here, we go back to KL, because KL makes more sense for distributions, and make a Gaussian assumption on the weight vector distribution. (This has close connections both to PAC-Bayes and, if I\'m wearing my Bayesian hat, Kalman filtering when you make a Gaussian assumption on the posterior, even though it\'s not really Gaussian... it would be interesting to see how these similarities play out.) The cool thing here is that you effectively get variable learning rates on different parameters, where confident parameters get moved less. (In practice, one really awesome effect is that you tend to only need one pass over your training data to do a good job!) If you\'re interested in the Bayesian connection, you can get a very similar style algorithm if you do EP on a Bayesian classification algorithm (by Stern, Herbrich and Graepel), which is what Microsoft Bing uses for online ads. This finally bring us to NIPS this year, where Koby Crammer, Alex Kulesza and Mark Dredze presented work on Adaptive Regularization of Weight Vectors. Here, they take Confidence Weighted classification and turn the constraints into pieces of the regularizer (somewhat akin to doing a Lagrangian trick). Doing so allows them to derive a representer theorem. But again, the intuition is exactly the same: don\'t change the classifier too much, but enough. All in all, this is a very interesting line of work. The reason I\'m posting about it is because I think seeing the connections makes it easier to sort these different ideas into bins in my head, depending on what your loss is (squared versus hinge), what your classifier looks like (linear versus distribution over linear) and what your notion of\'similar classifiers\'is (Euclidean or KL). (Aside: Tong Zhang has a paper on regularized winnow methods, which fits in here somewhere, but not quite as cleanly.)
This afternoon I sat by the side of the road, waiting for the crosstown bus. I sat there for what seemed like forever, but was probably no longer than 20 minutes. I finally got so impatient that I crouched next to the bus stop sign, counting the seconds between a car appearing around the bend and it passing me. I also got to thinking... If I can\'t hardly wait 20 minutes for the bus, what\'s it like to wait six years from the time you retire to when you first become eligible for the Hall of Fame? What\'s it like, the anticipation? Part of me thinks \'waiting for the bus\' is a good analogy here. Sometimes it\'s on time, sometimes you have to wait a little longer, and sometimes it never comes at all. A lot can happen in six years. Whole lives can change (but there\'s the Hall of Fame ballot announcement date, circled with permanent marker on the calendar in the back of your mind). For some guys, it\'s a given that the Hall will call (hey, that rhymes). Guys like Rickey Henderson, Greg Ma,\'ux, Craig Biggio--these guys don\'t have to worry. But is too much emphasis placed on being an inductee in the first year of eligibility? It took Duke Snider eleven years of voting to make the Hall of Fame (first appeared in 1970, inducted in 1980), Joe Cronin ten years (1947-1956), Don Drysdale ten years (1975-1984), and Bob Lemon 13 years (1964-1976). And those players are just four examples. There are plenty of others. It\'s guys like Jim Rice, David Concepcion, and Dale Murphy who get their hopes up, only to have them crushed year after year. And I guess I\'ll probably have to a,\' Fred McGriff\'s name to that list in a few years. McGriff becomes eligible next year (for 2010 enshrinement), and while I\'ll be pulling for him, these days 493 career home runs don\'t seem to be enough to hang your legacy on.
We had hoped we might have been able to go for a walk around the grounds with Sam and a couple of staff when we visited today. Jane had rung to try to arrange it yesterday. But just before we were due to set off we received a phone call from Sam\'s named nurse, J. As well as smashing his guitar on Thursday evening, on Friday evening Sam had slapped J\'s face and later thumped him in the stomach. He was unable to explain why he had acted in this way. He denied he had done it and claimed the mark left on J\'s face was a birth mark. So of course his leave has been cancelled again. It is lucky in a way - though not for him - that it was J. J is very experienced and genuinely wanted to try to understand why Sam had acted in this way so reacted to it all very calmly and properly. The phone conversation though was very positive and both J and Jane said how useful they had found it. Sam was quiet but fine when we visited. A bit distant perhaps. Friendly to start with but became more distant as we chatted. He mentioned slapping J but could not explain why - other than he was angry at being detained. He seems angry too at seeing us get older. Perhaps it reminds him of having lost his youth in hospital. We have noticed too how he is aging more quickly - lines around his eyes and so on. No doubt effects of the medication. We worry the internal effects may well be the same.
Sara and I got to the gym tonight for a nice workout at the BSC Westborough. I started off with a 2 mile run though I had intentions of running a bit further. I just didn\'t feel all that great and count myself as lucky to have finished the 2 mile run in 14:10 for an average pace of 7:04/mile with 280 calories burned. After running I lifted biceps and triceps. I did standing hammer curls, cable curls, cable rope pulldowns, cable v bar pulldowns and cable machine curls. In waiting for Sara I ended up jumping on the bike machine and doing a 4.02 mile ride in 15:37.
It was about 10 years ago when carpal-tunnel first hit me. Every time I put my hand on my mouse, I\'d get spasms of pain in my various parts of my arm. I tried special ergonomic mice and trackballs, but they didn\'t help. I tried speech recognition software, but it was a joke. Whether I could continue with my profession was becoming an issue. I even tried moving the mouse with my feet. Nose mousing was next. Then I discovered the Wacom tablet. For a long time, it was a godsend. The pain almost went away -- but not forever. A couple years ago, the pain started returning. The Wacom bought me some time, but it was not a permanent solution -- at least not by itself. Somebody recommended I read Pain Free at Your PC by Pete Egoscue. I\'m glad he did. This book has saved my career (even though I\'m not exactly following its advice). Its main point is that carpal tunnel originates with the spine -- that is, a spine in poor posture. When standing straight, the spine is in an\'S\'curve. Think of the neck, shoulder blades, lumbar and tail bone. When standing up straight, they are shaped like an\'S\'. The spine is a balanced spring with the skull balanced on top. Your arms are hanging straight down and your skeletal/joint/muscle system is at peace. When sitting with poor posture, however, the spine is in a\'C\'shape. The lumbar curve is gone or reduced. The spine is a cantilevered, stressed support for the head and arms. The spine, in turn, is supported by the small muscles of the back. But those muscles are meant to steer the spine and body, not support its weight. Now, what\'s the connection between the spine and wrist pain? Think of the song:\'The head bone is connected to the neck bone...\'In this case, the spine bone is connected to the shoulder bone, and the shoulder bone is connected to the arm bone. The bones and the muscles and the ligaments and tendons are connected. It\'s a system. When the spine is in a\'C\'shape, the body\'s structural support is out of whack. As Egoscue puts it (I can\'t quote directly, I lost the book), a poor posture will gradually make your bones and muscles disintegrate turning your body into a pain-wracked, arthritic, crumbled ruined husk of its former self. Of course, proper posture is the solution. But how do you make that happen? It\'s not easy, especially for slouch-meisters like me. Egoscu\'s solution: yoga. As I understand it, yoga will strengthen muscles that usually don\'t get enough exercise. His book has a number of yoga exercises that are specifically designed for carpal-tunnel suffers. He has exercises for light, medium and heavy PC users. His approach makes sense to me. Unfortunately, the story did not end there for me. I tried to do the exercises, but they hurt like hell. And they took a long time. And I don\'t have the discipline. I failed.
Also remember the weakness to alot of computers is the actual Web Browser itself as well. Every Browser (and System) has its weakness. Just Google\'PWN2OWN\'the Mac was hacked in under 10 seconds this year, and this was a fully patched system. Every System has its weaknesses. As long as you\'re web smart about the links and sites you visit, you\'ll be fine. Also if you have a good memory, use different passwords. I use about 20 different passwords (Yes, I\'m that paranoid :D) and each one of them has a different category e.g. Personal, Work, Bank, Mail, WebServers, etc... the daft thing alot of people do is use the same password for everything, e.g. you might sign up to a website and use the same password you do as your PayPal and E-Mail accounts. BAD IDEA!!!
Staying in a relationship when it is time to call it quits can lead to serious consequences for your health or well-being. Stress, tension and anxiety can take their toll and it simply isn\'t worth it. If you are suffering in a bad relationship and there\'s no sign of improvement, then it is best to end it and move on. It is better to be alone and happy then to stay with someone who makes you unhappy. You owe it to yourself to find true happiness with someone who loves, cares for, and respects you.
That\'s Bansko, a bit rough around the edges but friendly and accommodating at its center. And for those who want to stretch their wallet in luxury this is the place. Set in the southern Bulgarian mountains close to the border with Greece, Bankso has always been associated with cheap prices, but now it\'s becoming known for world class skiing as well. A crash in real estate speculation in 2008 has helped keep the prices down, but the residents of this former communist state kept themselves busy upgrading the town and ski area with the latest equipment and amenities. The speculation years left their scars in the form of half built hotels and high rise condominiums, but the old section of town was preserved reasonably well. There is still a rare lived in feeling to the old-town which makes a charming contrast to ski area and new construction just across
Hi everyone.  As you no doubt noticed, we pretty much shut down over the Christmas holidays.  I did this on purpose as I really wanted (needed) to focus on having an incredible Christmas and some complete down time.  In a,\'ition, I wanted to focus on launching my new book!  I\'m pleased to say that I was successful on all fronts.
I spent the next eight years reading everything I could about tribal people who lived in the deserts, mountains and jungles of the world. In 2005, after living in Argentina for five months, I was finally granted the opportunity to realise my dream by visiting a remote tribe in the Javari Basin of the Amazon Rainforest on the border between Peru in Brazil. After that I was hooked. In 2006 I visited nomads living in the remotest part of the Moroccan Atlas mountains. In 2007 I spent a month traveling independently in West Papua on the island of New Guinea then a week on Siberut, one of Indonesia\'s Mentawai Islands. My aim has been, wherever possible, to learn some lingua franca before I visit tribal groups so that I can visit them without a guide and can communicate directly with them myself. My style of travel on all of these trips could best be described as neither sight-seeing, backpacking or exploring but more just trying to understand different ways of thinking and viewing life and the world.
We need to stress good health at a young age.We need mandatory gym and phys ed through high school.We need children to bug there parents about not smoking in tight areas with them present,autos for one. We need insurance company\'s to allow for costs reflective of health.Less cost for healthier people.More help for those who need it because of things beyond there control.IE:Cancer,having never smoked,over weight because of a medical problem,again medical,not lazy.And stop free medical to illegals
I\'m in Kosovo now! What do I do? Don\'t panic, go to your nearest cafe (they\'re everywhere) and have one of the best inexpensive machiatos anywhere in the world. Feeling better? Good. Now, all you need to do is plan your exit from Kosovo by either flight or overland through another country (there are no flights direct from Pristina to Belgrade but you can fly from Skopje, Macedonia). If you want to get back into Serbia overland your best bet is to cross into Macedonia and then into Serbia by bus, or a nine hour train ride form Skopje.
Whenever you go to the Our Cancer group, you\'ll always see most recent blog posts first. Just to the right of the latest blog post, you\'ll see two tabs; one for blogs and the other for discussions. If you want to see recent discussions, just click that tab and it will switch to the discussion. There\'s also a\'view all\'button for both blog entries and discussions so you can browse recent submissions from other community members.
The rain eased off and a glowing purple and red sun began to set, apologising for all the stress and danger we had been through that day. The beach was empty, peaceful and calm.
he best way to protect yourself from computer viruses and remote attackers is to dedicate a computer to doing it for you, kinda like a network gateway for your home network. If you\'re the type of person that always worries about viruses and sensitive information being stolen but don\'t know that much about computer networks, I\'d recommend using untangle (http://www.untangle.com/home-content-fil. ), very easy to install and can quickly protect you home network in minutes, there\'s also parental filtering with predefined filters if you\'re worried about what sites your kids go on.

I was headed into an inferno, at least, that was what the news story on the Internet led me to believe. It was old news really, I remembered first hearing about the fires burning across the Peloponnesian Peninsula when I was in Rhodes a few weeks before. I had never even considered changing my plans due to the fires, though. After all, I had lived for many years in California where forest fires were commonplace and I was only going to get one chance of ‘seeing\' six of the Seven Wonders of the World before it was time to go home.
During our meetings, it became clear to me how entirely personal each volunteer\'s experience in country can be. We read one submission on the issue of ‘hello.\' This word, one of the most common on the planet, is routinely shouted at volunteers country wide. The article itself was written by a guy in a village who described the practice as overwhelming, often shouted by grown men being intentionally obnoxious.
No this is not True. But what is, is we have a stronger will power. Women have a Tendance to cheat on their diets. I went on a slim fast diet and lost 50lb in 30 days, so it dose work and I kept it off for more then 6 years. And so can everyone.
Difficult question... first, no macs aren\'t the answer and im not a mac hater im actually using one right now. You need to understand no computer that\'s connected to the internet can EVER be completely safe from viruses, Trojans and worms but precautions like virus scanners or internet security suites help. I recommend Mcafee and Norton because there updated quicker and because they have extra precautions others don\'t have. You can actually get mcafee for free sign in or sign up for aol and go to downloads section they offer an aol enhanced version under the security tab.
The crew disembarked us - hippies, German girls and big bags soaked on a remote rocky pier. Eventually a few motorcycles arrived and propelled us through the rainy jungle, dropping us off on the beach at the other end of the only road on the island.
Visit Serbia first. Fly into Belgrade, explore the country and then move on to Kosovo where you can obtain an entry visa at the Kosovo border checkpoint. Just remember you won\'t be able to return to Serbia the same way if you get a Kosovo entry stamp, so plan your flights carefully (e.g. fly into Belgrade and out from Pristina). Or you can ask the Kosovar boarder control not to stamp your passport not technically legal but it works for a lot of people (including me just last week).
I handed my passport to the Serbian police officer. He scowled, not from the encroaching cold, but because I was American and had Kosovo visa stamps. Thankfully, I also had a Serbian entry stamp so there was nothing he could do but waive me through. A few kilometers down a windy country road I reached the Kosovar border checkpoint.
During discussion of the article, however, it turned out each person in the room had experienced this phenomenon differently. My experience, in the city, was one of children, who seem to be just trying to see if the word they learned in school actually works, and then, lost in their excitement, repeat it ad infinitum. Young women described it coming from teenage boys only once they\'d past them, as a weird sexual cut, and the grey haired women amongst us (age being highly respected here) described largely no problems at all.
With Our Cancer, any of you can begin your own discussion or share your own story. For example, if you wanted to start a conversation about who\'s thinking of getting involved in a particular clinical trial, you could go to Our Cancer\'s discussion board, click the\'start a discussion\'button and begin a conversation about it. For example, Liz L. has already started a discussion about chemo fog. Or if you wanted to share a story of your experience at your first chemo session, you could create your own blog post by clicking the\'a,\' a post\'button - and maybe even write other blog posts as you complete your treatment. That\'s why it\'s called Our Cancer -- it\'s a place where all of us can share our experiences in Cancer World in a collaborative way.
Having lived in Australia for five years, I am in favor of some form of universal health care system. I am one of the many un-insured with in this country and without having VA benefits, I would be forced to go without health care or face great debt. Being unemployed and disabled makes it even more difficult.
The pain and the side effects will be there like uninvited guests.  They\'re hard to ignore, but I will do my best to do just that. So let\'s just remember all of our friends and loved ones who have had to deal with this dreadful disease, especially the ones we have lost, and enjoy all of the life and happiness that this special time brings. We must always remember that we are making memories that will help to carry us through the rough times to come.
Normally when you cross borders you only have to worry about a valid passport (don\'t forget it needs to be good for at least 6 months), and your visa. With Kosovo and Serbia things get a bit more complicated. There is an ambiguous international legal rational for Kosovo; a battle in the Security Council between the US, Russia and China over sovereignty and self-determination; a unilateral declaration of Independence by the Kosovar Government (supported by 65 countries in the world, but not the UN); and the blanket denial of that independence by Serbia, which maintains parallel government functions in parts of Kosovo. By now you may be wondering if there is a border or not there is depending on who you ask.
I was down in the balmy lowlands for what we call \'Culture Committee.\' Between myself and a crack-squad of likeminded volunteers, we crafted a book of volunteer stories related to cultural issues and an entire curriculum to be presented to the new batch of volunteers during their training, set to begin in April. We sought to provide a palatable presentation of everything from cultural basics like removing shoes upon entering a house, to more complex, highly emotional issues, like bride kidnapping.
Finally we broke through to the calmer side of the island, The rain was lighter here, waves calmer, we could see the coast of Thailand in the distance and everyone seemed to breath easier now we were sheltered on this side of the island.
This was high season and spoilt and busy? We were soaked and there was no place to stay, yet after the noisy crowds of the other islands, this was a chance to exhale.
Just over a week ago, reports surfaced that a Toyota Prius driver in San Diego was driving along a highway when his car became unresponsive. Police were called and helped stop the vehicle. In a press conference today, however, Toyota officials said they found significant inconsistencies in the driver\'s story. Toyota had engineers on hand to answer technical questions of reporters, who were also given test drives.\'To say this situation was sensationalized would be an enormous understatement,\'Mike Michels, a Toyota spokesman, said.The driver in question, James Sikes, called 911 to report his Prius was out of control and that the accelerator pedal didn\'t respond. A cop caught up with Sikes as he drove up to 90 miles an hour. Toyota officials inspected the car as well as did the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. However, a report over the weekend indicated they didn\'t find anything wrong either.Despite the discrepancies in the drivers story, Toyota disclosed one potential issue: indication that he car\'s brakes were severely damaged from overheating, which would confirm Sikes\' story. Also, according to the USA TODAY, there was an indication in one system that the brakes and accelerator had been pushed alternately, as if he were having trouble. But other than that, Michels said the Toyota probe of the Prius has found:
Men have more muscle mass, which burns fat therefore their metabolism is more active allowing them to burn off calories easier. Also, Men are socialized to want different foods than women like meats and starches, its not masculine for a man to crave a box of chocolates
I have grown to appreciate the shopping options in Singapore after living in some meager environments. However, skip the boring sameness of Orchard Street, where all you will find is high end shops carrying the same Louis Vuitton bags you can find back home. For something funkier hit the youth energized Bugis Street. Packed with hip handmade clothing stalls and accessories, this is where you can find bargains and maintain a bit of personal identity and style. Practice your negotiation skills, or just soak in the teaming market atmosphere as stall owners struggle to be noticed and shoppers hunt for the perfect Friday night outfit.
(Day 701 on the road) After resting my tired bones from the nine-day hike I had just completed, it was finally time to pick up Suzanne from the airport in Queenstown. Suzanne and I have been very good friends ever since we met at university in Hong Kong many years ago, and it was great to see her again (we had last met up in Singapore some 12 months ago). She will be travelling with me here in New Zealand for the next two weeks, and we both have been looking forward to this for a while now.
Unfortunately, as all cancer patients know, you can never completely get away from your body\'s assault on itself.  Leading up to the book launch, my PSA started climbing quickly, evidence the cancer was actively spreading.  The day after the launch, I had another test and found it had jumped way past what it was when I was first diagnosed and we have been unable to pinpoint where it is growing, which is cause for much anxiety.  In the meantime, the pain in my back is increasing.  I tried another type of hormone in a bid to slow things down, but the side effects drove me off that after only a week.
I think any universal health care plan would have to come with a income based scheme or means testing. If you can afford to pay for health care you should pay, however you would be able to recieve a percentage back through a medicare rebate scheme.
As Karen and Jay mentioned, all signs point to Speaker Pelosi using the\'self-executing rule\'to deem the Senate health care bill passed without a full vote on anything but the reconciliation package of fixes. House Dems really don\'t want to have an\'aye\'for the Senate bill\'s warts on their record (the\'Cornhusker Kickback\'ads practically write themselves.) But I would make two points: Voters aren\'t aware/won\'t remember/don\'t care about parliamentary process; it will be passage or not,\'yes\'or\'no\'at issue in November. And political attack ads are neither nuanced nor given to dogged devotion to the truth. Saying,\'I didn\'t vote to pass it, I agreed to deem it passed\'is hardly a line that will stick with voters, and it invites charges of Kerryesque flipfloppery. If there\'s any risk in\'deem and pass\'(Ezra Klein thinks there is,) the fact that Democrats are pursuing it is a strong indication the Republican spook campaign succeeded. Nate Silver identifies ten House Democrats who could plausibly face primary challenges from their left if they vote\'no.\'Interestingly, six of the ten are from New York (late filing deadline,) where the labor-powered Working Families Party has threatened to withhold support.
My time in Oman also made me aware of how quickly globalisation is making the world smaller, less varied and less wild. By age 13, villages I had visited aged 11 had telegraph poles running to them, one quaint fishing community had sprouted a giant stone harbour and the dirt track that had served as the main coast road had a new tarmac highway under construction next to it. They were all changes for the better but they gave me the idea that in my lifetime there would be no more opportunities to explore or meet people who lived in a radically different way from me.
This must have been serious storm as the deep-sea fishing boats were turning and heading for shore, their grey and hardy hulls taking cover for the night.
When a partner isn\'t fully in the moment of trying to fix a relationship, the work becomes a one-sided affair. You need to be able to fully be there for your partner when you need to work through tough times. This might mean that you need to take a few days off work or devote certain times to discussing ways to fix your relationship. These times should be uninterrupted by work obligations or time commitments so that neither person feels rushed or distracted.

Yea its all about the muscle guys have alot bigger muscle index than chicks and are naturally more bigger or taller than chicks. They take a higher calorie intake which means sometimes girls might eat the same as a guy but when you look at it the girl will eat more calories than they should and the guy will be at the calorie level he needs because guys have higher calorie intakes than girls. well thats how I see it ;) But yeah muscle helps burn calories faster making you lose weight and gain lean mass.
If the answers to these questions are mostly negative then it could be a sign that your relationship is on the rocks. It\'s certainly not healthy for a relationship to consist of frequent arguments, violence or demeaning behaviour. If you are experiencing any emotional, verbal or physical abuse, then it\'s definitely time to call it quits.
This is quite remarkable. I may be wrong--and commenters are welcome to correct me--but I can\'t remember another ethnic or religious lobbying group publicly siding with a foreign country against the President of the United States...especially when the country in question is engaging in behavior that the international community believes is illegal. Once again, every U.S. President since Richard Nixon has called for a freeze of settlements being built in Palestinian areas, including East Jerusalem, conquered by Israel in 1967. AIPAC stands, with Israel, against every one of those Presidents.
But this is different: Israel is clearly in the wrong and, according to the Petraeus briefing, it is hurting American foreign policy in the region. In fact, Israel is doubly wrong: its non-stop lobbying for war with Iran is also exceedingly dangerous (the US Joint Chiefs of Staff have unanimously counseled against war with Iran). The fact that David Petraeus, a hero to many on the right, is concerned about Israel\'s intransigence should give AIPAC and the neocons pause. It won\'t, but it should.
Christmas itself was wonderful.  It can be a very difficult time for someone with cancer as the disease becomes a giant elephant in the room and can often make it difficult to really enjoy the spirit of the holidays.  When I was first diagnosed seven years ago, I didn\'t even want to have Christmas as I didn\'t think we had anything to celebrate.  But this year, we surrounded ourselves with family ( including friends we now consider as family) and had a wonderful time.  Having my nephew\'s two-year old son Levi here provided that wide-eyed child component and my eighty-nine year old mother provided a link to a lifetime off Christmas memories.  It was the best Christmas I\'ve had for many years and was very important to me as I worry more and more about what the future brings.
There are two ways you and your spouse can separate: either with an informal separation or by a formal legal separation. An informal separation is basically whatever the two of you agree it to be. Typically, one of you stays in the home you had previously shared, and the other moves into some other quarters. At this stage you normally wouldn\'t make any formal property division, but you would agree, informally, on some kind of working arrangement about possession of things like cars, the bank accounts, the credit cards, and the stereo.
Mr. Ho and his business partner. If you see them at the train station you can trust them. Maybe. But what a great story if everything went horribly, horrible wrong. The perks of being a travel writer. To my disappointment nothing happened except arriving safely at the zoo, ticket in hand. Mr. Ho and his young business partner are an unlikely pairing. He is tall, has salt and pepper hair and looks like he could be her father. They run the service 3 times a day, once in the afternoon and twice between 5:30 pm and 8:30 pm (one way only), and earn their money from buying tickets in bulk. It only takes 20 minutes and is faster than the public bus service. Give them a try if you are lucky enough to emerge from Ang Mo Kio station and they are parked outside.
Thanks again to everyone who\'s given us feedback on this project. And above all special thanks to both Leroy and Laurie - Leroy for encouraging us to continue the community and Laurie for helping us make it happen. This community wouldn\'t be here if it weren\'t for them.
I am slowly trying to get back to writing regularly and am hoping, in the next few days to take time off and at least write small pieces. Over the last few months, I had some big, hairy audacious ideas for blogs but never could translate them into an actual post. Clearly because I was lazy to sit in one place for long enough to complete them. But I also believe it has to do with the medium - A blog, personally, gives you just one shot at getting it right. I have never re-written any of my blog posts or re-read old ones in an effort to make them better. Once they are written (after minor changes and re-writes, immediately afterwards), they are set in stone.

Arvind from Bangalore says, Brian Lara has called for the establishment of a centralised academy for the various cricket-playing islands in the Caribbean to groom young talent. Lara said West Indies relied too much on the natural ability of players. Have West Indies always had poor infrastructure? If so, how did they manage to dominate world cricket in the 1970s and 80s?

Do not be so dejected.This is the layer which has been created by him,ie,Mr Gadkari.This team will be given responsibility to deliver  Those who fail may even be replaced in the days to come.  A pessimist is one who ses the darkness in the light.An optimist is one who sees the light in the darkness  So be optimistic about the outcome  People choose whom they wish to choose, and not the names.The performance makes the people to choose the party.Names that matters-then does not matters.See How Mr mani Shankar Iyer has lost the election this time, and how after losing the battle in the first count,Mr Chidambaram won the battle after recounting  Do not be so broken.These are the early days.More wopuld follow

What a game! It was one of the best Final\'s I have seen in a while and India played brilliantly to clinch the First Twenty Twenty World Cup defeating Pakistan. So the record of not losing to Pak in any WC still holds.  Watched every ball of this match with nail biting excitement. India has this knack of putting themselves in difficult situations when it should have been an easy wrap up. During Pak batting the game was mostly in India\'s favor except for the last 20 balls when Bajji and Sreeshanth were hit for 5 sixes. When will India learn to bowl well in the last overs? But they held their nerve and pulled it off.  Hats off to Dhoni and the young Indian team!!! They really were winners!!!
For more than a year , I have been listening to her polambals during tea breaks .I must agree that it has been pretty entertaining . I have been subjected to similar tortures , that includes having to eat what she cooked ....and still , when I want to share something important , she is one of the first person who comes to my mind . Bhu ..u rock :).
archana!!! to me a very good and silent girl!!! didnt know much of her even though we were in the same bus.. she always has a look as though she has just woken up from sleep lol!! has a nice set of friends.. just chatting with them makes me feel as though i have entered their gang..maybe she talks a lot only with her close friends.. on the whole good, silent, sleepy girl
In real life, Alice struggles with the burdens of impending adulthood, seemingly unable to fit in with the standards of society. Moments after being proposed to, Alice falls back through the rabbit hole.   It is prophesied that, in order to defeat the Red Queen, Alice will side with the White Queen (Anne Hathaway) and kill the Jabberwocky (voiced by Christopher Lee).  However, there is doubt over whether Alice is the\'real\'Alice. The White Rabbit doesn\'t believe she is, while the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp) wholeheartedly believes Alice is indeed the\'real\'Alice.
Super Star Rajni next movie\'Enthiran\'with ace director Shankar and his dream crew has begun shooting recently......So i thought let me put my insights about the movie and do Strength Weakness Opportunity Threat(SWOT)  analysis about the movie....I dont want the readers feel that i will be biased in doing this analysis as i have a penchant for Rajni....i assure that it will be done in a neutral manner...  STRENGTH: The greatest strength of the movie is Rajni-Shankar-Rahman combination,this combination has been a great success in\'SIVAJI\'and they proved their mettle in that blokbluster.Technical crew for\'enthiran\'is one of the strong points for the movie.....Ratnavelu for cinematography,anthony for editing,Yuen Woo Ping who handled stunt for many Hollywood movies like Crouching Tiger Hi,\'en Dragon, Matrix and Kill Bill has been roped in for\'Endhiran\'.  WEAKNESS: Writer Sujatha\'s demise is one of the weakness for the movie.....He has been instrumental in Shankar\'s success since\'boys\'...It is also believed that story of enthiran was written by him...One of the weakness of\'sivaji\'was it lacked a coherent story,the same can be repeated in Enthiran....Aishwarya rai  roles in recent movies except\'guru\'were very lackadaisical....Hope shankar provides a meaty role which has a scope for acting.....
Here i am back with another review. I always keep thinking about having a plastic surgery. always wanted to tune my nose. I wanted to get a great nose. I am not just bubbling around and just saying i just want it with any reason. It doesn\'t meant that i do not like my original nose. I just wanna tune it to make it better than before. But, finding a great plastic surgeon is another hectic job .I do not want it to be a hard job. It should be simple for me to handle it but nowadays it is becoming more difficult than before.  A high fee too makes this process more difficult. But lucky for me, i have this website.They have many kinds of plastic surgery and they review their prices too. So it is easy for anyone to make a choice before going to any plastic surgery. For those women out there who want to enlarge their breast size, you can go to this website and make your dream come true. This website is all about Plastic Surgery. You can check out this site if you would want some information related to plastic surgery .You can check the location of the Plastic surgery clinic and make your way there as soon as possible.  I assure you that the quality of their service is great. If you want to have a Beverly Hills breast augmentation, you should visit this link. You can see there are many types of surgery that you can do .You will be impressed by their service. You can also get tummy tuck in Beverly hills .You can remove excess skin and fat from the mi,\'le and lower abdomen to tighten the muscle of the abdominal wall. You will look more beautiful than before and you will feel more confident.

I took some heat in e-mail and here on our comments section for my recent piece about what I saw as fanboy whining over the Captain America casting process, and I want to clarify something... I don\'t think fandom is a bad thing.  I think it is the thermometer by which we measure the passion for various properties or characters, and that\'s a great thing.  I also think fandom, when focused, can be an incredibly valuable force in the process, and this is one of those times.  I think it becomes\'whining\'when you\'re second-guessing something you can\'t accurately judge because you haven\'t see the materials, when you don\'t know how an audition went, or when you simply leap to a conclusion from an emotional place.  In the case of Norton\'s Banner, you already have some sense of what he brings to the role.  The real question now is,\'Do you consider him a piece of the puzzle, and do you want him back?\'If the answer is yes, then I think it\'s time to clearly communicate that to Marvel.
Chelsea V Liverpool - live on ESPN at 21:25 IST on sunday It will be for the 17th time that these 2 sides will be meeting since Rafael Benitez became the Liverpool manager and since then they have won only 5 times n Chelsea have won 8 times. Liverpool currently struggling for good results will be without their star striker Fernando Torres, who is suffering from a hamstring injury but is expected to return for the Champions League clash against Inter in 10 days time. Also missing will be Voronin, Arbeloa, Aurelio and Agger. Xabi Alonso is suspended. Babel too might miss due to a knock he picked up during the midweek while on international duty. Chelsea will be without Terry and Shevchenko while Lampard and Mikel could be playing. I hate to say this but Chelsea may win comfortably unless Liverpool put up a spirited performance to at least manage a draw. Prediction - Chelsea 1 - 0 Liverpool   Manchester United v Manchester City - live on ESPN at 18:55 IST on sunday One of the biggest derby games in England is the Manchester derby. Manu have lost thrice this season and all of those came when Rooney did not play. Rooney will miss this game due to suspension. Also missing from United squad will be Evra, Neville and Saha. Duo of Corluka and Elano are suspended for City and Richards is also likely to be rested after knee complaint. Zimbabwe forward Benjani will be making his City debut. City have not won at Old Trafford since 1974 and this year too wont be different. Having lost 3 - 1 to Arsenal at home, City have almost no chance of winning at Old Trafford. Prediction- Manchester United 3 - 0 Manchester City
VK Murthy, the ace cinematographer has been awarded the Dada Sahib Phalke Award this year. The highest honor reserved for the film fraternity by the establishment. Generally and till now, mostly it has been given to decorate better known stars and directors, never a technician. This has been a departure and therefore I am all praise for the award being bestowed on VK Murthy, a generous kind and humble human, one with whom I had the great pleasure of working in two films - Nastik and Ram Balram. But I do not consider myself worthy of his genius. His most important works I believe were in films made by another genius, Guru Dutt.
New Zealand batsman Brendon McCullum is keen to put the lessons learned from a difficult 2009 IPL into practice during this year\'s tournament.  McCullum is in the mi,\'le of a home series against Australia. New Zealand lost the Chapell-Hadlee series 3-2 and the teams will meet in Wellington on Friday for the first of two Test matches. With the 2010 IPL successfully underway amongst security fears, McCullum is still waiting on clearance before confirming his involvement but was eager to participate in the competition because of its massive impact on the cricketing world.

When God made Steffi... he gave her, probably the best SMILE!!! Smiling Beauty! Haven\'t met her still! Waiting for that day! Met her first exactly 365 days back in this same place~~ Thanx to Orkut! She started off by asking me not to snoop around her profile but now we ended up being the bestest of friends! Loyalty, childishness, bubliness and sense of humour are her trademark! They say Good friends are like stars. You don\'t always see them, but you always know they are there. She is just like that! She values and treasures her friend much more than her life! And not to forget her craze for Suriya! An ardent fan, she is! All the time going gaga over suriya! She loves her sister to the core and her CASPER! Just the kid, as she is, still at heart! You would know the value of true friendship when you are with her. Great to have a friend like YOU dear! Here is to the 100 more years of friendship and fun! Cheers! God Bless you!  Courtesy : Steffi
That was a very interesting and nice write-up. I could relate to most of the incidents/things mentioned but I have come to the conclusion\'You cannot please everyone and you also dont have to please everyone\'. People will be there to advice,complain or comment whether you do things right or wrong....If someone very close to you offers advice/suggestion, it is worth pondering as they (this person ha ha)might see things differently....For the rest, just listen and move on!!
Our country celebrated it\'s 62nd independence day today.The main essence of celebrating the independence day is to remember our heroes who fought for our country to gain independence from the hands of British.But is it the real case happening in our country.It\'s really a question to ponder. when we start from school life,the students are asked to come to the school and some chief guest will come and hoist the flag and students will clap.Then the chief guest will be rendering some useless speech and students should clap for it and they will be given a chocolate and return home so that they can spend the other part of the day happily watching TV shows and movies telecasting in it. When you take the TV channels instead of putting shows on how India got freedom or at least a film taken on patriotism they will be telecasting a film of masala genre.So the children don\'t know anything about the national heroes.So the Gen Next would also be knowing anything of the national heroes and slowly the main essence of independence day is being forgotten.And it will be considered most of holiday than a day of remembering our heroes. The worst of all this someone given to pinup the flag in his shirt and he is doing it outside.Even the political leaders exchange wishes only and instead of remembering their heroes they will be thinking of how to impress the people with the help of this day by giving some useless speeches. Worst of all this is Vodafone which charges for sms on special occasions stopped charging on this day and that tells the significance of the day.
Most tools will let you convert a partition from one file type to another, i.e. from NTFS to FAT/FAT32 or vice versa. Needless to say that in most cases, such a conversion, especially from NTFS to FAT/FAT32 will cause the files to lose their NTFS permissions (ACLs), and in some cases where EFS was used to encrypt the files, it will actually cause you to lose access to these files. So beware!  Some of these tools may be able to help you recover deleted partitions, and if data on that disk was un-damaged, actually help you gain access to that data. Some, but not all of the tools may have the ability to move existing partitions from one location on the disk to another location, again, without losing data.

Never bunked like he used to, cared a lot abt attendance. After telling so much abt hari, if i don\'t mention abt his walk & smile-its a cardinal sin:-)) There r many fans for d way he smiles & walks. Many try 2 imitate him rather with no success.  An ardent fan of Vijay. However worse d movie is, watches it 1st day 1st show (ena koduma sir ithu?) Then he is a flutist & knows karate (ithelema avane sonathu, none has seen him in action) keeps singing one song r d othr during class hours (mayb tats d reason many lecturers leave d class asap:-p) joined a gym recently & improved his strength immensly (tat was 2 kick guys like me, i guess-was lucky nt 2 get kicked thouhgh) wears tight shirts & t shirts (u know y) Anyway this just a glimpse of what Hari is! L try covering him, maybe later sometime It was wonderful knowing u man:)

I am afraid I dont agree with you! with your suggestions it will become congress 2! why do we want another congress pretender? Office holders and tickets should be only given to people who succeed on an internal competition irrespective of caste or religion what you have proposed is internal reservations to christians musllims OBC\'s and dalits! a shadow cabinet is a good idea! The important change we need is NO wishywashy principles they should nail their colours to the mast and campaign for uniform civil code, abolition of sec 370, abolition of caste politics, abolition of minority appeasement abolition of reservations and sops, and treat ALL indians equal!
A real sport..but beware..she will give back as much as what she takes...she has this intimidating aura about her..in TV rating terms..she is strictly not for the weak hearted..but once you get to know her from close quarters,she is so down to earth..she is well conversant with high quality English as well as petta baashai..I have never seen her turn sentimental.. even if someone tries to ..she just laughs it off..of late she has become one of my most trusted friend, philosopher,guide,confidant all rolled into one..( I bet she will giggle even for this)...she is someone whom I instinctively message or call when I am feeling low..she can really life your spirits up in no time.. has a good dressing sense..presents herself aptly..she is BOLD,BEAUTIFUL,CONFIDENT,TOUGH and different from most people that I have met.. she is an enigma.. hate her or love her.. you just can\'t ignore her..all the best KAVYA RAJAPPA.. and KEEP FIGHTING!:)

Had been on a cabin trip weekend of Sep 20th. The cabin was about 2 ½ hours drive from Seattle. What started out as a 10 person trip eventually came down to 4. You know how these things go. People dropping out at the last minute with some excuse or the other. I also tried my best to get out of it but with no luck. What was my excuse   well I had none   that was the problem. I have no complaints now. It was four guys in a cabin all by ourselves. Now don\'t jump ahead of yourselves and get the wrong idea.

acted in my first play when I was 9 (4th standard) - I was playing a Malayali traveling in a train as part of a skit on National Integration. One of these days, I will scan the picture from the play and post it here for all of you to have a hearty laugh on how silly boys with lipstick look and how terrible primary school teachers are in putting makeup. And fortunately for me, I have been doing at least one play every year ever since - through school, college, and ignoring a brief hiatus while I was in France, throughout my professional life as well (Incidentally, 2008 was the first year I didn\'t do a play since I landed in Bangalore). .
i feel that sijo is the most understanding and most wonderful friend i have ever had in my life...a man who takes every thing in the right spirit & also some one who helps me a lot every time when i am in troble......... i am sure sucess will step with you in whatever you do. God bless you.
The next morning when Swapna logged in she had forgotten completely about the surprise and they were chatting about random things as the conversation went by. Ram did not bother to remind her either. Swapna quickly typed, \'We are going to have a huge bash for Anisha\'s birthday tomorrow at her place. We couldn\'t have a party that day ‘cos she had plans with her family.\' Ram exclaimed, \'Wow, that\'s awesome sweety . So, you are gonna be at her place all day tomorrow eh?\'. Swapna giggled to herself and replied, \'Why do you ask like you\'re going to come to the party? ;)\' Ram sighed heavily on the other side and keyed in, \'How I wish babe  how I wish  \' They continued and she went on and on about what she had planned for the party. Ram was missing all the action and he felt bad about it. Ram typed out in frustration, \'Damn! Semester ended yesterday and if only I could afford to get to India :( :(.\' Swapna asked anticipating a positive response, \'Is there no way you can come now?\' Ram made a quick and short reply, \'Nope.\' Swapna was now asking Ram what else they could do. Swapna asking him for some ideas for the party. Ram said his mood wasn\'t ok and he logged off. Swapna tried to persuade him to stay, but, he refused and left. Swapna was missing him online and she was su,\'enly reminded of the surprise that he had promised. She was now very curious to know what it was and she called him. The conversation was very terse. Ram answered the call and in a very depressed tone replied, \'I will call you tomorrow. I know you were reminded of the surprise I promised you. I\'ll let you know tomorrow. Waiting at times increases the value of the surprise. Hold on to your curiosity sweety.\' Without waiting for her to reply, he hung up.
sam is a gud person.. He\'s cool . never gets tensed.. Humorous ..But very cunning person.. Use to be a gud boy in Skool days . He is one of my best friends .we ver class mates in skool. Likes to criticize everyone. Different person.. Very Smart (about 10 % of my smartness i think)  Trust me he\'s a gud person.  Overall - 85/100 Very gud

But the stock market crashed once the interim budget turned out to be a damp squib. What else would you expect from a substitute (Pranab) of a substitute (Manmohan) of a substitute (Chidambaram)? It should have been Manmohan all along.  In his defense, Pranab argued that he did not have the mandate do anything more with the budget. No mandate? Does this mean Prakash Karat is the one we should be blaming?  Pranab termed his interim budget as one for the ‘aam admi\'. Unfortunately, for the ‘aam admi\', the government is now the ‘baam admi\'.  Did you read about that? A farmer in Rajasthan claims that an Army aircraft bombed his 5 bhiga field and home. No statements from the Army. Guess the IAF\'s policy is not to ‘kisaan-and-tell\'. Or it\'s in a real kisaan jam. Or it doesn\'t think it\'s that bhig-a deal. Take your pick.
well this guy does not like if u call him praveen or kumar..likes being called sakthi.. well he is one of the sweetest person i have ever met.. he is a kind hearted , humble , helpful person.. i get stunned by the way he talks to elders respects his parents and elders ..one more thing is thet i hav never seen him get angry ..has a smily face.. he is one perfect roommate who u can get.very helpful. he is a very soft person.. well on the whole a great human being and one of my best friends.. friends for ever .. cheers dude
Ya true that she doesnt spend a lot of time with me talking but there was this magical time in the bus ride from kulu to simla,wen we actually started talking ,ill vote it as my best moment with her cannot forget that never ever,Really got to know her as a mature , a bit more stable and strong head dudette then from the rather clumsy, always cheering ,gleeful self that she seems the rest of the time... Beware she is nothing as she projects herself to be the beautifull dimpled smile can have a lot of meaning he he he . She\'s got a lot of policies governing herlself but that doesnt keep her from enjoyin life to max... seriously!! she is one whose absense will dampen any group\'s mood.And as for ur warning against me not keeping in touch u don have to worry abt it i aint gonna do the same mistake of letting time wit u slip away as i did earlier. Keep smiling u will always be same jayashree tat i know ,cos there is nothing where u can improve u\'re so perfect .... Keep smiling Rok on... U better keep in touch :)
shanki as i call him has been more than a friend to me rite from the time i met him in 6th standard..it has been 10 years since we met ...and through those ten years i ahve always had a friend with whom i could confide even the deepest of secrets...he knows me better than i myself do...thats the truth... i have never seen him in a serious mood except on the field ...there he is a tough competitor and a shrewd cricketing brain....i lve the way he plays the game and had been lucky to play once under him in a very serious match...;)  u stay with him for half an hour and he will surely come up with soem prank and bring u down with laughter... we ahd together roamed the length n breadth of adambakkam n the surrounding suburbs...and those days would remain evergreen in my memory...

Hi I am writing this to one of my Best Friend and with whom i share most of my persona;l problems(I think he knows everything about me).He is a person who is having an easy take and easy go life.I can say that he is An apt person in this fast world.he has got a very great attitude and ambition and i feel that he will soon be a succesful enterprenur.everyone sees in him\'the comedy nature\'but only few know his  serious life.. i think he is one of the best coders that i have ever seen.he has never reacted sensitivily to the comments laid by others and thats his plus.... all the best macha.....You are really great.
O\'Brien got the live show started as a way to help his staff of about 40 keep busy and employed. NBC gave up an extra $12 million for the staff. Considering that the staffers uprooted their families and pulled their kids out of schools in New York and moved them across the country -- only to see NBC end Conan\'s Tonight Show run after only seven months, they deserve whatever extra gig they can get until O\'Brien resurfaces behind a desk for another network.  In New York, the tour hits Radio City Music Hall and Madison Square Garden in June, venues that sold out quickly. Hey, maybe Conan will return to Gotham when he lands the next job. Things were going great for him until he left.
I n pravin wer skool classmates, Very cool guy.. never gets tensed.. Very quiet. Enjoys roaming around in our home town. Gud companion while roaming, We also take\'the terror\'Janesh and\'Dirty dog\'Alan and\'Ra,\'y\'Pradesh n Praveen with us.. Used to Play cricket very well.. He bats stylish and Bowls like mc\'grath. Girls define him as sweet person.. has a lot of fans due to his character...
Between 2 friends, maybe very close or may not be close, they could just be friends. Assume that the guy has feelings for the gal all of a su,\'en. Like I said before, the guy decides to tell her.\'Hey, I have started feeling differently about u lately... blah blah.... this is off topic\'The gal if interested says \'Yes\' and all is ll. OMG here comes the other if. NO??!!?? Ok now wats the next step. I have commonly seen the gal starting to distance herself from the guy. Cmon give him a break he is not gonna stalk you. Guys give her a break. She said NO which means any amount of hanging around doesnt work. So give up and atleast be sane enough to respect her feelings and her space.  If you are very close friends, give it a small gap, may be one or 2 days, call back and just be normal. DO NOT ATTEMPT to talk about wat happened unless u r sure, both u and her are comfortable talking about it. Otherwise, its best to avoid it. Agreed it is tough to start with. A few days, and u will be back to comfort zone and then probably, u will be able to discuss it in the lighter vein.  Ok, here goes. What is it about expressing love that people think its an offense? The guy had an \'opinion\'. I use the word opinion just because its just precisely what it is. You go thro this phase where you think a person is special to you. Hence, its an \'OPINION\' you form about the person. Freedom of Speech/ Expression(This I know is not applicable completely to something of this kind) but, I want to use this to play down the misconceptions surrounding the \'Opinion\'.  The girl, you will accept/not accept an opinion about a car, bike, house, etc...etc... when the guy says it. Why is it when this opinion is expressed and then asked about ur take on it... you get so offensive?? He just said he loves you and wants you to be his \'ONE\'. Just say whether you agree or not and get moving along. Yes, again a play down on the whole concept of expressing love.
James Bobin is on board to direct the movie, the plot of which is under wraps. The TV show as well as some of the movies tended to have one key human actor with whom the Muppets associated on their adventures. It is known that Segel plays a man on a quest to find and reunite the Muppets.  The actor\'s coming aboard is a natural extension of the development process; he wrote the script with pal Nicholas Stoller.  Segel has been on a tear with feature work of late. He recently boarded the Cameron Diaz comedy\'Bad Teacher\'and last week signed to star with Ed Helms in the Duplass brothers\' latest movie,\'Jeff Who Lives at Home.
The Universe already loves you. Love it back by loving yourself and accepting yourself for who you are.  May be the \'love it back\' is interpreted by the *&^%#@ THEY\' in their own way.!! If we are we always and not harm others....thats life i supose. Corectaa? I suffered a lot in my life bcos of those\'%&*(& THEY\'and so i stopped worrying about them long time back. Sometimes i think what so far i have earned by having a concern for those\'naalu peru\'? Its bcos of your individuality and courage i admire you always.
In fact, there was a scene here that reminded me of another good movie - Mullholland Drive - that bared and flaunted a specific multiple-interpretation scene to needlessly and abruptly drop a hint rather in the mi,\'le of the movie. When you use a scene as a hint dropper and not a narrative driver, you give away the ending. (This is the scene where this aspiring actress meets a cowboy in a boxing ring). The movie was significantly less interesting after that point. That scene was disconnected, random and unreal. The entire movie was like that. But that scene was a little bit more of all that than it needed to be.
Since only a few Indian universities has met the international standards.Its a welcome decission from the govt. As a result our universities will have to face a tough competion for their survival which will raise the quality of our education substantially. And more of our students will get oppurtunity to acquire quality education without the need of going abroad.  but few concerns will be  Since ultimately people in India want quality of education be raised to be more competitive in this world till we are able to stannd on our knees. For that we would like a foregin help but after we stand we should be able to take the charge off. That dosent mean it should be Use & Throw policy.  my suggetions:  1. It shold be a treaty of more than policy or business. 2. It will be better to merge maximum number than letting to open new ones.   Since education will draw the future India.
From the day1 of my coll life i seein him. he\'s very silent and very sensitive.. silent but cant with stand his comment. i made the mistake of tellin him the dialogue durin first sem exam. he made the dialogue a highlight for these four days. we\'re room mates durin second year and we won BEST ROOM AWARD for tat year. from this all can understand we both make a perfect combination. as a true friend he\'s been with me for all time for suggestion or for entertain or for carin.. many times we both ve same character.. you can hear a typical tirupur speech when he talk with his dad.. he has faced lotta prob in fourth year and end of third year but too he managed well.. nice lad lookin silent all the time(like fittin silencer as said in boys flim).. noone can understand his inner feelings.. i thanked to god to get such a friendship in my life time... ALL THE BEST. i\'m always there for you for anything and at anytime...
The second installment of Stephenie Meyer\'s hugely popular and successful Twilight franchise did exactly what it set out to do: capitalize on its pre-existing fanbase and deliver more vampire/human/werewolf romantic intrigue. Though it only scored an overall 28% on the Tomatometer (compared to the first movie\'s 50% rating), The Twilight Saga: New Moon was a box office success, making close to $300 million. The story follows the continuing adventures of everygirl Bella Swan, whose vampire heartthrob Edward Cullen leaves town in order to keep Bella safe from his enemies;
My sweeeeeeeeeeeet sister..The lines may seem a bit clichéd to readers, but yes she is one sort of person I wud love to be with at all times ...Gone are the days when she asks me to imitate the college profs and crack pjs or rather mokkais and enjoy the scene..I get reminded of all those when I am all alone, dipped in an ocean of solitude missing the dearer ones.... One of the many people whom I miss badly right now......Missssssssssssss u a lot........And testimonials written truly with heart, out of affection generally have a bad and an incomplete ending....And I guess this fits well in such a category..........Will continue writing further..............
First of all, the IPL is made for India. It won\'t work as well anywhere else. India has a billion people who are absolutely cricket-mad. The owners of the franchises are Indian and wealthy, the sponsors mainly are Indian, there are lots of Indian players and it\'s an Indian TV channel that has put its money in. I don\'t think any other country could do it so well even if it tried. The authorities in England were talking about it a year ago but they can\'t do it so well. The main thing about the IPL is that it is fun, it is pure entertainment, and it\'s Bollywood - or Hollywood, call it what you want. The great thing is that the catchment area for these franchises is so huge that nobody else can compete with that. It will always be better in India.
He is one of the most interesting ppl in my life...well we met at a tech symposium Aarush-SRM univ,but it seemed we had been friends for life,he could have been the better judge for the events sparing the SRM staff with his impeccable knowledge on a diverse range of topics,and flabbergasted everyone with his tech-trivia! Lol .. a prodigy i wud say.....this word sums up this good friend of mine,ten years down the lane,u wud be a gr8 prof (swear my head upon it!),and ur zeal for knowledge will take u to greater zeniths ! All the best dood,i know u are one of the best in my journey ! Rock on...

BUBBLY JAI All the best for your future. May ur dream comes true. From ur everloving BROTHER :)
What is the logic behind bringing Hema Malini, Smriti Irani? What is (not are) their contrinution towards developing India? Just for the sake of bringing young and women in the party executive body, i think Mr. Gadkari forgot that when it comes to election this team would not be able to stand and win seats for BJP candidates in front of much more credible names like Mr. Chidambaram, Mr. M. S. Ahluwalia, our dear Prime Minister, Mr. Rahul Gandhi, Mr. Manu Singhavi. Mrs. S. Gandhi. Varun Gandhi has already shown that he has no solutions to finght poverty and upbringing the life style of people at least in areas near Pilibhit and he is now promoted...good Mr Gadkari. but as an old RSS swayam sevak, who has run Shakha for RSS in UP, i feel cheated and so does the country if BJP is a national party and promisses of a better india. I would have been more happy to see people like Modi, Raman Singh and Sivraj Singh Chauhan, Yashvant Sinha whom people can trust. Even if we want to give you opportunity to run the country in next election, we do not see credible names whom we people of india could trust the way we trust PC, MM. Rahul Gandhi has not delivered any thing till now but he shows a progressive mind and the way he is taking his career forward gives an impression that he is interested in inclusive growth despite been from the most power full family. while u are selecting people who are good at laughing, dancing, saas-bahu natak.....and no plans for a better india. U have delivered a lot for Mumbai and Maharashtra, still i can\'t understand that u chose this team. May be excellence and delivery were not ur primary parameters while selecting ur team and u are also convinced that PC and MM could take better care of the nation and are better people who can take India to the next level.  Gud luck to u & ur team Mr. Gadkari. i will be happy to see my self defeated for my feedback and if u win, i will go to Sidhivinayak that u could deliver for the country.
For the last couple, maybe three weeks I have become crazy watching movies during the weekends. I just turn on the television and start watching the movie that is currently playing, usually its one of the cute ones with Steve Martin, Sanjay Dutt, Paresh Rawal or Lindsay Lohen.

It\'s Holi. The festival of colours. The one day politicians can change shades every minute with no questions asked. Ominous signs for the BJP   no takers for the saffron dyes.  No one was spared. Even LK Advani was left red-faced at the end of the day. But it had nothing to do with Holi. Just that all his allies are bailing on him at the last minute.  Speaking of which, Naveen Patnaik is facing another flood crisis in Orissa. This time around, his office has been inundated with frantic calls from every single Prime Ministerial candidate in the Third Front.  Its ridiculous how everyone in the Third Front is considering himself / herself PM material. Having said that, its good to have choices. Last time, we had to pick between an Italian and someone who\'d never won a Lok Sabha seat.  The scary part? Mayawati has thrown her hat in the ring. She is virtually holding the Left Parties to ransom threatening to leave the Front if she is not nominated. Am slowly starting to buy into the whole karma philosophy.
I can\'t help it. I have a fascination with dogs that are larger than their owners; it makes me laugh every single time. This isn\'t the best photo that I took yesterday at 89th St and Park Ave. ... but I think you can see that the lady in the picture can\'t be much taller than five feet while her pet, standing on its hind legs, would probably be about a foot taller. She could ride him home! Jimmy Fallon ( who gave me a high five once ) and his family were asked to leave Posto Pizza (at 18th and 2nd in New York City) after they interpreted a public statement made by Fallon as a slight against their establishment -- Fallon clarified he likes the Pizza, he just felt they did not belong in the competition he was discussing because their crust is super thin as opposed to the others. Regardless, he and his family got the boot as the owners laughed and laughed. Via Jimmy Fallon\'s Twitter When I first started writing popular cuture I used to write\'Top Ten Lists\'of prominent actors\' back catalogue of films. I think the first one I wrote was Tom Cruise -- as kind of a tongue-in-cheek joke I selected one of his more infamous movies as number one. This guy takes that same movie to a whole new level : (psst: I think it\'s The Natural . Yes, definitely The Natural .) From Mouthpiecesports via The Will Leitch Experience I have no idea if he was a comedian, but someone died in New York today. Here\'s the deal: I get terrible reception on my cell phone in my apartment, so, on a day like today when I have an interview to conduct, I venture over to Carl Schurz Park -- which is between the East River and East End Avenue around 87th Street. While I was there today all hell broke loose. Apparently, someone jumped into the river and a large portion of the NYPD arrived by land, sea and air. Along with the Coast Guard, FDNY and the Justice League of America. Yes, I watched. Did I feel bad? Not really. Did I feel like I was in the movie Stand by Me and was about to see Ray Brower\'s body? Yes. Well, they never found the body, he his apparently still floating down the East River somewhere. Here are the photos of the action before everyone got bored and went home. Hey guys: I will be tweeting my ass off about the SNL visit tonight. So, good time as ever to sign up and follow, right? FOLLOW MIKE ON TWITTER Two quick points: Carter Bays, this week, who is one of the creators of How I Met Your Mother , told Entertainment Weekly that,\'At the end of the season, we will a,\'ress the title of the show.\'Well, then. I\'m not sure what to think of this. I\'m sure it\'s just a tease but think of how many shows drop in quality after a revel (which I will go on record saying will not fully happen this season). Remember those old Burger King ads asking who Herb was? The only person who had never tried a Whopper. Remember when they revealed Herb and how successful Herb was to the Burger King franchise? Me either. Regardless, is this a good thing? Also, I\'m not going to mention who, but, a certain SNL featured player -- who will forever be known in my apartment as\'Most Awesome Person Ever\'-- invited me to watch this upcoming Saturday\'s show from the writers room. And yeah, Tracy Morgan is hosting; I\'m sure it will be a subdued affair. My god, this may turn out to be the greatest experience of my life. Hey, I\'ll be tweeting that day . (At least a couple, I\'ve been to television tapings before; cell phones are frowned upon.) If you haven\'t yet: sign up and be one of my six followers ! Remember that episode of Seinfeld when Kramer mistakenly gets called into a business meeting even though he didn\'t actually work there. I think I may be hoping this somehow happens to me.\'Hey, we need something right now ... come on, get in here, what are you waiting for?\'I don\'t quite understand it, but yes, I\'m now using Twitter . Perhaps this will be a solution to my lack of original blogging; perhaps not. Regardless, if you so choose to follow me , please do at your own risk ... I have no idea what I am doing.
Hey finally PureDistortion has moved to its very own site. It is at www.puredistortion.com. This blog will stay up and have all of the archived posts here from before the move. they will be avaliable at puredistortion.blogger.com and blog.puredistortion.com Dale Finally the local game store is getting into the Wizards of the coast game Magic the Gathering and stocking some of the cards. For me this is really cool as this is a game that I have always been interested in but no one in my social circles played at all. Also I think it is a game that my wife could really get into as well which would be cool as the continual smackdown I get in card games like Uno, SkipBo and Phase10 are beginning to wear a bit thin LOL. So with this motivation I have been looking into how the game works as I have only ever had a couple of goes at the game in shops as demos and came a cross a series of online videos done by Wizards that are really great at explaining the game and how it works. I ahve only supplied links or else this post would be massive LOL. This is a 6 part series that is titled\'Learn to play Magic the Gathering\': (links to each video are the part 1 ect links) PART 1: Is an introduction to Magic and the decks and how to get started. PART 2: Is an explanation on the cards them selves. PART 3: Is about the different types of cards that will be in your deck. PART 4: Is all about the turn sequence and a basic turn. PART 5: Is all about attacking and blocking. PART 6: Deck building and the stratergies. Another thing that the guys at Wizards do is they supply the rules online so that you can get down to your hobby store get a starter deck and get straight into playing you can get a copy of the rules straight from the website there are also link to other helpful playing resources such as the gatherer . The Gatherer is an online database of all of the cards available so you can study up on you opponent or hunt out your next rare purchase/trade. Also check out www.magicthegathering.com there is heaps of stuff on there. On Dakka Dakka today found a link to a site called armyroster.com . Army Roster is a web based army builder that is now looking for people for Beta accounts to test the site and provide feedback and bugs. I creatd an account on the site and went through and started to build a 1500pt list for my Orc and Goblin Fantasy army (at the moment Warhammer Fantasy lists are all that can be created) and found the interface nice and simple to use, though it did not have the AJAX web2.0 feel that I had come to expect from web applications these days. Now apart from the feel there were a few more things that annoyed me, the basic functionality was not complete yes so links that were in the site would go to error pages and also the lists for the Fantasy Armies were incomplete with me not being able to a,\' in things that are in the army book. Also the need for the site to be all linked in as a community was also something that annoyed me (fro no real reason) and this is something that I have issues with more and more new generation web apps providing a service have to try and shoe horn in community tools like forums into the site when forums already exist for the subculture that they are aiming at, I believe that these developers hould focus more on building intergration with existing services. Though I must say when the opponent finder... one of the broken bits of the site... is working I think this will be a great way for people to find other people in the local area to find opponents. Now with those points aside this site has real potential to be a real competitor to Army Builder especially if they build on a few little bits of functionality. For example the site already validates your core choice requirements and total points but not charater magic items. The ability for people to be able to view your avaliable armies via a URL so that you can link to your profile in a forum. Also the ability to import your own army spec files for games that army roster does not currently supprt would also be an awesome idea and take some load off the developers doing data entry for every game that they wish to support. Though overall I think when this app gets out of Beta... and I am griping about a site that is in very early Beta at the moment... it will be an awesome site that will be a serious alternative to Army Builder and free. So check out armyroster.com and keep an eye on it as when it is up and running I think it will be a great web app. I know I will be using it. Found an interesting solution for users of plesk/qmail for how to identify a user who is abusing your authenticated SMTP service. Running the command: cat /var/log/messages | grep -i smtp_auth | grep\'logged in\'| awk {\' print $11 \'} | awk -F / {\' print $6\'@\'$5 \'} | sort | uniq -c | sort -n | tail or: cat /var/log/syslog | grep -i smtp_auth | grep\'logged in\'| awk {\' print $11 \'} | awk -F / {\' print $6\'@\'$5 \'} | sort | uniq -c | sort -n | tail Depending on your Linux Distro and you will get an output like the example bellow: 7 user@example.com 7 someone@spmewhere.net.au 8 stuff@onthenet.com.au 8919 user@cracke,\'omain.com.au As you can see the account \'user\' for the domain \'cracke,\'omain.com.au\' are having unusually high amounts of SMTP connections for an account. This is useful for tracking bulk email being sent through your system or hijacked accounts being used by spammers. I found this on rackerhacker.com a site by Seinior Rackspace Systems Engineer Major Hayden, go and check it out it is full of awesome content. With all of the talk going on on the net and in main stream media about the new\'Great Firewall of Australia\'ISP spam filter I though I should have my say. Firstly I think that this is ridiculous especially when the report that has been released regarding there 30 user test in Tasmania.... 30 user how the hell does 30 users represent Australia\'s traffic, maybe that is the amount of users that dont download MP3\'s or movies, but it is not a decent representation of the traffic this country generates. Also the reports suggest that internet link costs will go up due to the cost of implementation and the speed of the link will be slower. Apart from this just making no sence at all why should someone decide for me what is relevant for me to view on the net (now Mr Conroy I am not a pedophile or a terroist) as filters miss one big factor..... context. How can a filter that only sees a request to a server on port 80 judge if i am looking at a site of\'potentially\'harmful information such as euthinasia to kill my self or I am writing a ballanced document about both sides of the topic.. in shor it can\'t and if some one is looking in this example for a way to kill themselves they will find it one way or another you aren\'t going to stop them. Also with the filtering being done at the ISP level what is going to stop the ISP tracking your data and selling it to marketing firms in some way or another and this dosent have to be a company as a whole, it could be just an enterprising engineer working in the back end. This senario gets even worse when some if the technologies have the ability to decrypt and inspect SSL traffic the same traffic that used by internet banking and sites online.. can you say the death of online shopping in Australia. Another thing to consider is not only will we be told what not to view but these decisions will cause false positive removing\'legitimate\'that we should be entitled to see. Also what stops the logical progression of an anoymous filtering tool becoming a tracking tool so it is logged where your IP has been or that a government would use the filter to block content that is contrary to there views and opinions. It is all possible just look to the harsh filtering of there internet users by there government. Finially with this solution costing Millions and Millions and can be simpily avoided by using one of the many tools avaliable today. Proxies, TOR, VPN, Web Anonimisers all have the ability to bypass this technology so people who are looking at this dodgy content still will be able to as ISP\'s will not be able to block these technologies as that would serverly hamper Australian businesses. In the end if it does come in to Australia I will be starting a buisnes soffering VPN solutio, help stop one of the greatest free speah injustices in this lifetime.ns to a data centre in another country to make some cash of all of the dodgy and paranoid people out there. In the end they cant stop what you look at on the net just hamper the growth of the technology sectors of Australia. They would be better spending this money on stopping people in this country creating the content. Please sign the online petition here. Also go to nocleanfeed.com to see what else you can do.

Ill keep updating things as they come up to where this is headed. Wired is doing a piece on all of the winners of there previous photography competitions. There are some awesome photos here, my favourites are the Gecko Eye by Alan M which is awesome and the picture of the guy canoeing in the mist by Peter Bowers. The next photography contest being run by Wired is a Portraits contest so any photographers reading get involved. Check out the contests page at Wired.com for more info. Also check out the gallery of the other winners here. last week Redhat detcted intrusions to certin computer systems. There have been minimal details on the intrusion and what actually has happened as investigations are still happening. RedHat\'s first concern was the RedHat Network (RHN) and ensuring that their distrobution channel with there clients was intact. I think this is a great move by RedHat acting so swiftly and ensuring that the packages that were in there up2date/yum channels were secure. What was detected was a number ro SSH Service (here is a link to info on SSH) packages were signed and released to channels. In a move to quickly rmove this threat from the channel and customers systems that may have already down loaded and installed the RPM\'s is to relaease new RPM\'s into the channels for the affected systems. This is another move that I think is a great move by RedHat as it quickly and elegantly removes these unauthorised packages quickliy from RHEL systems and the update channels, using this method also means that mant people will go without even having the packages installed on there system as RPM (RedHat\'s package management system) uses versions to controll what packages it downloads and will always download the newr version if it avaliable. The affected versions of RedHat Enterprise Linux are Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.5 Extended Update Support. As well as theis there has been a script released by RedHat that will assess weather you system has installed the affected packages and is avaliable from the RedHat website (see link at end of post). I think that this issue has been handled well by RedHat and has showed how simply issues like this can be managed with a solid package management solution such as RPM. It will be interesting to see how this progresses and I will keep an eye on this and keep you updated as news gets out about new updates on the issue. Link to RedHat Security Advisory Link to openssh-blacklist script While trawling through the www.wargamerau.com forums today I came across 2 new things that make the future release of THQ\'s Dawn of war series looking like something to keep an eye out for. The first is the new trailer that was released yesterday titled \'This world is not ours\'. It is amazing and the animators at THQ have done a great job capturing the Warhammer 40k universe. Not only that this trailer is that good it points that Games Workshop really needs to consider making a Full CG Movie based on the 40K world. Though enough ranting check it out: Though this is only the start, not only are THQ pumping out awesome cut scene trailers, but they are also in the process of having a British army FV432 APC cut, chopped and rebuilt into a Space Marine Rhino... I know how cool is that. The TQH Rhino Build Diary announces \'The completed Rhino will be making its public début at Games Workshop Games Day 2008 at the Birmingham NEC on 14th September. Click here for more information or to book tickets for the event.\' Unfortunately the Rhino wont be filled with Space Marines but with high end gaming machines that I am assuming that you will be able to have a crack at DoW2 if you are able to get close enough. Check out the Rhino Diary article @ THQ here and the Flikr Diary of photos of the build here. Also keep an eye here at PD as being both a Warhammer and car fan, I will be following the build as it goes on. So if you are going to this event please get in contact with me so that we can get some pics up of the completed Rhino sitting at Games Day.
We\'re working in the studio now. I\'ll be posting pictures. Check this space... We boarded the Laurence M. Gould for our journey back on December 23, 2006. Going back through the Gerlache Passage was even more exciting and beautiful than coming the other way. If you look back towards the beginning of the blog, you can see the brilliant day that greeted us in Antarctica. On the way back the day was overcast, with mysterious lines of clouds clinging to the mountains on either side of the passage. I couldn\'t put down the camera , or if I did, it was to pick up the video camera. I could barely grab a sandwich! As the ship turned away, Palmer Station seemed to fade into the distance. But no sooner was it gone when su,\'enly the scenery was utterly compelling. We saw whales numerous times, although none with the Canon digital. This combination of granite and fog, ice and water was more mysterious than any landscape I had ever seen. Only the photos of Wang Wusheng come even close. Usually it didn\'t look sinister but that first picture reminds me of the pilots I have known who joke about granite clouds. The changes happened fast. Focusing on one point sometimes yielded several different photos, both because of the motion of the ship and also the movement of the clouds. The scale of the mountains is not terribly evident in these small photos. But I estimate the cliffs as 30 to 75 meters high. Late in the day we passed Smith Island. Antarctica was retreating in the distance. The low angle of sun had us seeing night for the first time in nearly two months. I wondered how I would react, but I slept so soundly, it was a relief. We had an almost endless sunset that went on for hours. Here is mate, Larry Brissette at the controls. Since there were only five passengers on board, the crew invited us to be in the bridge. Art and I took them up on their offer and spent a good deal of time talking and watching the navigation process as we crossed the Drake. It was so smooth that they were calling it Drake\'s Lake! Lucky, because we had talked to passengers on a cruise ship that moored at Palmer and they had encountered 10 to 15 meter waves. A part of me would have liked to experience something like that, but the prospect of being tied to my bed for three days was not too appealing. This is how we celebrated Christmas Day. Captain Scott Flanagan gave us a\'safety demo\'by shooting of flares and letting us shoot some off the stern of the ship. This is the chart and log as we approached Cape Horn. We continued up the Atlantic coast of Tierra del Fueg o, Argentina, to the mouth of the Straight of Magellan. Once inside the straight, we met the pilot who guided us into port at Punta Arenas. Somewhere in the Drake Passage I snapped this picture of the ship board computer screen. It was Christmas day, day 359 of the year, 17:04 GMT. Our position was at 55+ degrees South latitude, 64º west longitude. We were headed almost due north 345º with a bearing of 348º, making 11.5 knots of headway. The wind was coming from the due north at 25 or 22 knots (different gauges). Our heading is toward Isla Estados . The salinity of the water was 33.7 (not sure the units), Water temperature was 5.362ºC (up at least 5º from our departure at Palmer.) Depth is 3953 meters (more than 10,000 feet!) Air temp is 10.2ºC. Relative humidity 76%. Wind Chill -1.1ºC. Barometric pressure measured 983.5 millibars. Here is Punta Arenas on our arrival. I was overwhelmed by the color. Just seeing green trees was an intense experience. I like Punta Arenas. It is a stopping over point for many outdoor treks and the town is full of camping stores like North Face and Patagonia. (This is Patagonia , after, all.) Maybe someday I\'ll come back and explore South America from here. I have a lot to say about Antarctica, what I saw, what I learned. I\'ll be posting form time to time about the progress on my work in the studio. I hope to display the cast glass along with the photography and video and perhaps some cast ice, as well. I\'m just looking for the right venue. I\'d still like to post my thoughts on the vast visual input of my ice studies. Another might tackle the implications of global climate change and the vast re-ordering of the earth which is happening under our feet. I\'d like to especially than the National Science Foundation for making this magical voyage possible, along with their contractor for Antarctica, Raytheon Polar Services. Everybody was wonderful and more than helpful. I saw more, accomplished more than I ever could have imagined. Some of your comments that were posted also deserve a response. I didn\'t take full advantage of the blog format, but what a blast this has been! Go Blogger! If you wish to contact me, please write druth@glass.com . I\'ll try to answer all questions. On the last full day we were at Palmer Station, I wanted to go out in the Zodiac one last time. Art demurred. I think he was looking forward to getting on the Gould and heading home. I wanted to see the one part of the glacier face that we had not been able to see from the Zodiacs. Curt Smith was eager to go. Our technology wizard, he ran the computer network and knew about all the electronics. This channel was created by a collapse of the glacier in 2003 that cut off Old Palmer from the main part of Anvers Island. The channel itself was too narrow to allow boating, because of its nearness to the calving glacier face. But by climbing over Old Palmer we were able to get close and see the new ice. It was worth it because the whole scene was so fresh and pure. Plus it connected the parts we had seen from the boat. The famous skua. Not sure if this is a south polar skua or a brown skua. They are slightly obnoxious birds that are like giant seagulls. The eat penguin eggs and chicks, and are scavengers. Not too popular among the Happy Feet crowd, but hey, a bird\'s gotta eat! They were very protective of their own nests. Art got a picture of one coming at him dead on, also on Old Palmer. We heard they like to kick as they go by so he ducked, but got the photo anyway. We jumped over a lot of rocks. Its amazing how much of a rubble pile is left in the wake of glacier retreat. My feet, ankles and knees hurt for weeks! We were hoping to take one more look at the ice arch. But a colony of elephant seals had gathered in front of our access. These two young males were wrestling right in our path. We went around them. The Gould had pulled in a day earlier, loading freight from Palmer. It was there to take us home. A bittersweet ending. We deleted ourselves from the computer systems, the lab and our dorm room. All of our stuff was packed and ready to ship. By time I took this picture, they had already loaded our freezer container that had been on the edge of the dock. That night we stayed on the Gould in preparation for leaving the next morning. Dear Friends, I`m travelling in Chile, on the slow route home. I have many great photos yet to post so watch this space sometime after January 5th, 2007. Art and I took many photos in the Gerlache and Neumayer Passages. The day was quite different from the brilliant, cloudless day when we arrived. This one was misty and dramatic. I´ll get to it soon. DAVID We are leaving Palmer Station today, Saturday, December 23, for our four day boat ride on the Laurence M. Gould back to Punta Arenas, Chile. A bittersweet ending, leaving this beautiful place. However, I got what I came for, which was information on how the ice looks. I feel that with the molds and so many photographs I have learned so much. Now I can go home, digest, and start to make my cast glass sculpture. I expect to a,\' a few postings to this blog as I dig out photos and clean them up with Photoshop. (Not to enchance them, so much as to make them more realistic than what the electronic camera thought it saw.) Hang on for a few weeks until I get home. Thank you, everybody, for your support and comments. This has been so fun and I feel invigorated by all your compliments and questions. Please email me at druth@glass.com DAVID RUTH On old Palmer, which is now an island, due to the retreat of the glacier, and the former site of Palmer Station, there is both an ice arch and also an ice cave. We posted pictures of the ice arch before. This time we couldn\'t get to it because the elephant seals had taken it over. Fifteen or more had come inside, and a few were in the cave itself. A few weeks ago, Jeff found the entrance to the ice cave under the snow and dug it out. I had seen pictures and was eager to get back to Old Palmer but circumstances delayed us for a while. The entrance is small and we had to crawl in. You couldn\'t stand up, but what a scene. The whole thing is glowing blue green ice, floor ceiling and walls. It has indented arches forming a long tunnel, maybe 20 or 24 meters. The floor was lightly frozen over some water, which I found when I sat down. Christina is the person in charge of all the long running experiments, mostly in Terra Lab. She has been doing time-lapse studies of the environment. Last one was of the Gould leaving, in several thousand pictures. I suggested a picture of my ice sculpture melting and evaporating. In a land without green plants the rocks become stark, the lichens vivid. Especially as the snow melts off the glacier rubble, it exposes beauty in the patterns of lichens, moss and the rocks themselves. I have been in love with rocks for years, but here they are so prominent. In my proposal to the NSF I requested that I be allowed to cast the local rock if I decided that the it was more interesting than the ice. In the end, although I love the ice, the variety of textures is not all that great. After ten molds we had most of them. I asked and was granted persmission to spread the silicone mold material on sea-washed rocks next to the station. The resulting rubber mold is spectacular, although I didn\'t get to see it for long as it was snatched away to send home. Art has the incriminating photo of me spreading the raw goop on the rocks. I felt kind of bad doing it, even with permission since this environment is so pristine, the international park, as it were. But the silicone performed like a champ and completely peeled off the rock without a trace. I spent a few minutes picking up the few pieces, but there is no remaining evidence that anyting happened there, to my relief. I had visions of spending the last two days of my stay at Palmer Station rubbing moling compound off the rocks. Fortunately that was not the case. No post of mine from Antarctica would be complete without pictures of ice. We got the boat out and found some gorgeous pieces in Arthur Harbor. This piece was clear ice, but even underwater, you can see the facets, veils and bubbles. One last blue ice glacier bit. Two minutes of glorious sunset on the night before solstice at midnight. Orange light on the blue ice. I figured out how to save the glacier! I\'m going to turn it into glass. I actually managed to make a small glass sculpture in the Palmer Station lab using exactly the process I had proposed with the ice molds. Over the past few weeks, Art and I have taken several silicone molds off of ice surfaces from pieces we have found in the water around the station. I melted some paraffin wax into different silicone textures and built up a small wax model for the glass using three textures from the ice. After embe,\'ing the wax in a dental casting plaster, I melted out the wax in a small lab bench furnace at about 200ºC. Here is my studio on the mash and grind deck of Palmer Bio building. We put the kiln go outside so as not to smoke everyone our during the burnout process. I was worried that the weather might affect the firing temperature, but it didn\'t. Here is the mold with chunks of glass I had brought from Oakland, melting at nearly 800ºC. The glass is a very light copper/cobalt blue, with about a thousandth percent colorant, very light. Ken setting the temperature on the controller. This controller was not ideal since it wouldn\'t turn down slower than 1ºC per minute. I wanted the high temperature cooling to be less than half that so I babied it for several hours while it went through that critical phase. Here is the piece when I broke it out of the mold. Notice the two textures. One was the smooth faceted ice and the other side was the snowy, granular ice. The\'nose\'is a third slightly wrinkly texture. Zenobia and Kerry organized an art show in the bar at Palmer. I put in some of my ice pieces, including this tall one I have shown before in\'Ice Studies.\'The top photo is after an hour out of the freezer container. The second, several hours later as the sun was setting. The ice broke up internally around the crystals, which had also formed the facets. The afternoon was warm enough so the ice started to melt. It lasted just about exactly 24 hours before it tumbled to the deck. I also put in one of the silicone molds. I wonder if anybody got it, but it represented an absence of form, absence of a sculpture, maybe the absence of the glacier. Several guys were fascinated by the silicone, since it\'s flexible and strong. Above is another picture of my glass casting taken in the declining light of the day at about 11PM. Below is another of our\'Ice Studies,\'when we were in the container with the photo lights. This one used one blue light to accentuate the clear form.
My first impression of Front Row was so positive - this crazy mac thing has a remote control, and you can use it to browse your media stuff. That\'s AWESOME, I love it! But then I ran into difficulties - I had trouble importing files into iTunes. I imported Iron & Wine like 5 times before I figured it out - the files had damaged tags, so iTunes (Apple\'s media management software) couldn\'t recognize them. Ok, that\'s a pain. I stuck into a Windows program, rewrote the tags, and then it worked. And then I decided I wanted to watch movies over the network. This turned out to be a challenge. The answer was to connect to the network share, and to drop a symbolic link to the mac filesystem into the\'Movies\'folder, so that I could make Front Row browse to that share. But then the first time that the mac slept, it severed the connection to the remote volume. After lots of research, I\'ve found no simple solution. Apparently you can write a script to automatically mount a volume when the computer wakes from sleep, and there may be pay software out there, but no thanks on both counts. My solution so far - since I was moving my media to external hard drives anyway, I just plug that sucker into the mac. No problem. So I run Front Row, browse to Movies movies volumes mybook tv ds9 and I can watch all the Rene Auberjonois I want. It works, though I wouldn\'t say it\'just\'works. Of course, I have another hard drive in the living room, connected to the nice stereo, and that drive has all my music. I can\'t listen to any of it through Front Row. Because that music isn\'t in the iTunes database, it doesn\'t exist as far as Front Row is concerned. And I\'m not about to let iTunes get its hands on that folder. I don\'t want to force all my computers to use iTunes. I don\'t even know how I\'d go about dealing with the fact that I have one archive of the music which must be accessible to several computers. It\'s a solution that just doesn\'t work for me. Maybe it\'s years of windows use, but I am very much accustomed to the model that my computer files are organized by a filesystem hierarchy, and programs must access that hierarchy to work. I hate synching, and the attendant requirement that I lose control over my filesystems and access to those filesystems. That\'s why my mp3 player is now just my Blackberry Curve. I plug it into my computer, browse the filesystem, see what\'s there. I can drag a new folder into it at any time and delete folders at will. I don\'t have to run any program other than explorer to do this. I don\'t need any special cables to charge it, either, because I just plug it into a usb port. It\'s such a simple solution. I love it to death. I\'m sure iTunes could do something similar if I were using an iPod, but I\'d have to a,\' the music to the iTunes database and then figure out how to put a selection of music on the iPod. And that\'s assuming I didn\'t run into any Iron & Wine-style problems. And I\'m thinking about all this because of that badly-named iPad. I\'m sure some people will like it, but I don\'t get it. I feel like you\'re paying a premium for a crippled computer. Like the iPhone, it\'s designed to lock you into using Apple products and Apple stores to get all your content, and I don\'t want that. For less than half the price of the iPad, I could have a netbook that would offer a real keyboard, the ability to run a much larger selection of applications, similar battery life, similar or better portability (having seen how many broken iPhone screens there are out there, I wonder how that big glass is going to fare), and a higher-resolution display. Mostly, it looks like a media player to me, and it lacks an HD display. It\'s a big glass box that you throw in your backpack and sometimes you surf the web on it. And maybe it\'s goofy to turn a netbook on its side to read comics, but I\'ve done it and it works really, really well. But the best part is that I don\'t have to pay one company every time I want to do something on my netbook. I bought the damn computer, and it will do what I want it to with the music and movies that I already have. Also, my netbook cost me less than half what the iPad will cost. I don\'t get it. I love this Badly Drawn Boy song - the chorus starts\'Soleil all over you, warm sun pours over me\'. Perfect for these grey days. Another favorite\'sun\'song of mine is David Bowie\'s Memory of a Free Festival, here presented in appropriately\'ragged and naive\'cover form by a band of British optometry students: As the students explain in the video, the band makes heavy use of an institutional VCS3 synthesizer, made by EMS. EMS, o,\'ly enough, advertised its synthesizers with nun imagery . The synthesizers sound - thick and analog - used on early Doctor Who. The effect - satori must be something quite the same. plus blocked fire hydrant plus fire truck equals hypocrisy comedy gold . A Metafilter thread about a video mocking The Dark Knight\'s plot holes yields this interesting comment by user rokusan: [...] the screenplay had a lot of buzz [....] because the structure was unexpectedly tight (despite the running time) and it was even darker than expected. I do remember, too, that it was presented to me as\'it\'s about relentlessness.\'[....] The War on Terror buzz was because at the time, it was seen in some circles as unusually brave/crazy to attack or mock the USA\'s illegal surveillance apparatus: the movie shoved the wrongness of it at the audience by having one of America\'s Most Trusted Voices™ tell us how wrong it was. Big Budget Hollywood hadn\'t taken an anti-government stance much in recent times. This was unusual, and I think a lot of folks anticipating a\'comic book\'story didn\'t expect it. [....] I continue to be really surprised at the love for this movie (currently #9 on IMDB\'s top 250). I am doubly surprised at the excitement over the tightness of the thing - I thought it made no sense at all, like it\'s plot went through the blender. Scenes just come and go. Most famously - what happened at the end of the joker\'s home invasion? The scene ends with no resolution. I like Heath Ledger in TDK, but that\'s about it. Good Metafilter discussion about whether you should default on your home loan when the value of the home is way below the mortgage amount. Homes are immensely personal, and the discussion highlights the extent to which personal fondness for homes and senses of morality unite to cause people to make irrational decisions about their houses. There\'s a sad tale in there of a guy whose dad refused to go into bankruptcy out of a sense of honor, and the negative impact it had on his family.
Sorry, ki,\'os, but this blog has gone the way of the dodo. We\'ve moved the blog over to our home site at ComicFoundry.com . So click over, continue reading and update your RSS feeds. Cya there Hey all! Changes are a coming for this site. Namely that it will be defunct quite shortly as we\'ve relaunched ComicFoundry.com . Say goodbye to the users and portfolios — as much I loved having them as part of the original site it\'s not really what Comic Foundry is about any more. So say hello to a streamlined site with our integrated blog, story archive and issue excerpts. You can also now buy issues of the magazine and subscriptions through the site! So head on over to the new site , update your links and update your RSS feeds. See you there! (From a story on DIY costumes in the October issue of Complex) You\'re all probably excited about seeing Battlestar Galactica: Razor, right? I can\'t wait to see a TV movie about the Pegasus crew that debuts on Nov. 24th. Really, I can\'t wait. That\'s why I was so glad that registration on this site just opened for advance screenings in select cities on Nov. 12th! The lucky cities include: • Boston • Chicago • Dallas/ Ft. Worth • Los Angeles • New York City • Philadelphia • San Francisco • Seattle Hurry and register before they\'re out of fraking seats. Mark Millar just posted that he got turned down for writing the Superman movie sequel because he was too associated with Marvel: Well, sadly, I\'m a Marvel guy and we were surprised to find out that WB couldn\'t hire me for a DC property. They were incredibly nice and superbly apologetic about it, but when they discussed the matter seriously DC explained just how associated I am with Marvel Comics at the moment and it\'s against company policy to hire the competition. It\'s absolutely nothing personal. I spoke to some friends at DC and they explained this has happened with a couple of big Marvel writers in the last couple of years and I absolutely respect that. My question is: How is that different when super-DC guy Geoff Johns wrote and produced for the Blade TV series (a Marvel property)? A great 300 parody, courtesy of Robot Chicken The trailer to Vertigo\'s series of online comics that serve as a prequel to the December film I Am Legend is up and in HD .

Welcome to Grade 1:\'Alright students, what does an ichthyosaur look like?\'&nbsp;\'They look like dolphins !\'&nbsp;\'Whales , like whales!\'&nbsp;\'Yeah FISH !!!\'&nbsp;\'SHAAARKS!\'&nbsp;\'Ooo ooo, Mr. Bond , oooo???!\'Yes, Billy?\'Miga !&nbsp; They look like Miga !\'&nbsp;\'YEAH!!! MIGA !!!\'&nbsp;\'MIGAMIGAMIGAAAAA !!!!\'Settle down CHILDREN! CHILDREN! Ugh...\'Miga , for the uninitiated, was an Olympic mascot here in Vancouver - part bear and part orca .&nbsp; I assume it is the orca that Billy, the made-up child in this real-life situation, is relating ichthyosaurs to.&nbsp; Dolphins, whales, fish, orca - ARE ichthyosaurs so similar?&nbsp; Or, like Miga, more of a mix of creatures? Or are we just imposing our understanding of extant animals upon extinct ones?&nbsp; What did ichthyosaurs look like? With these beautiful aquatic reptiles being the focus of ART Evolved \'s next Gallery , I thought we should begin discussing how exactly they should be reconstructed.&nbsp; What are the current controversies palaeo-artists are dealing with when restoring ichthyosaurs from fossil to flesh? Darren Naish (at Tetrapod Zoology) recently (Sept. 2008) discussed a few of the assumptions we make when we think of what ichthyosaurs look like and how they behave.&nbsp; Did they really have dorsal fins?&nbsp; How much of our knowledge of ichthyosaur body shape was faked by unscrupulous preparators?&nbsp; Most aquatic swimmers ( fish, dolphins ) have a dorsal fin, two pectoral fins and a powerful tail.&nbsp; Why did ichthyosaurs retain their two hind-fins?&nbsp; In an older article , Naish ponders the question: Did they use their pectoral fins and\'fly\'underwater?&nbsp; There are also a few questions I\'d like to ask here, confronting the traditional view about ichthyosaurs: 1) Was their skin slick and smooth like a dolphin, or bumpy and scaly like a monitor lizard? 2)&nbsp; Did they eat only squid and ammonites? 3)&nbsp; Did all genus of ichthyosaur reproduce through live birth? 4)&nbsp; Did they partake in cannibalistic behavior? 5)&nbsp; What did the huge Shonisaurs eat? 6)&nbsp; Could I have ri,\'en one? 7)&nbsp; Isn\'t there an easier way to spell\'ichthyosaur?\'&nbsp; Maybe with less h\'s? I am hoping that some of our readers might have some insight into the World of Ichthyosaurs!&nbsp; Help us reconstruct more accurate creatures! &nbsp; Speak up!&nbsp; We won\'t bite! ...much! And to get our collective ichthyosaur brains working, watch this They Might Be Giants\'Nine Bowls of Soup ,\'staring Mr. Ichthyosaur... Some fantastically modern artwork from 1959.

I adore the way that evolution is embraced by this popular magazine and - yeah, feel nostalgic. Note: cross-posted from my blog because this is just too cool. &nbsp; When I say\'Therapod\'what pops into your mind?&nbsp; A sharp-toothed, fleet-footed, flesh-eating monster of a dinosaur, right?&nbsp; Tyrannosaurs, spinosaurs, raptors... But what about a squat, tiny-headed, long-necked, plant-eater? These plant-eating therapods are known to the world as Therizinosaurs - named \'scythe lizard\' on account of their abnormally large claws on their hands. This family of dinosaurs (Therizinosauridae), previously know as Segnosaurs, has a strange and convoluted history of discovery, with palaeontologists at times calling them\'turtle-like lizards,\'prosauropods, and carnivorous reptiles.&nbsp; It wasn\'t until the discovery of similar genus\' in the 80\'s and 90\'s, that Therizinosaurs were finally classified as advanced herviborous maniraptorian theropods. Recreating an animal so recently reinterpreted takes skill, research, and time.&nbsp; The wonderful results from this process are collected below - a Time Capsule full of Therizinosaurs , recreated in glorious pencil, paint, and pixels!&nbsp; To participate in this and future Time Capsules, all you need to do is send your image to artevolved@gmail.com .&nbsp; It\'s not too late to join in the fun!

Therizinosaurus: a creature from Jim Henson\'s The Dark Crystal by Sarah Snell-Pym I started off by looking at creatures I thought had similar features or habitat niches to the Therizinosaurs and then drew a \'shape\' outline from a skeletal representation p199 of Vertebrate Palaeontology 2nd Edition. The creature seems to have had an identity crisis in the world of palaeontology but the most recent stuff I found suggested feathers and stiff hair type structures so that\'s what I went with. My actual aim was to build an evolution of Therizinosaurs in palaeontology of which this would be one of the end members! &nbsp; Therizinosaur by Anthony Contoleon Therizinosaurus 2000 by David Tana An early attempt at reconstructing Therizinosaurus ( Late Cretaceous Period, China ) , using only pencil and paper.

A Slap in the Face by Peter Bond A Therizinosaurus cheloniformis repells an attack by a passing Alioramus remotus on a floodplain in Mongolia, 70-65 million years ago. I wanted to illustrate one of the less-shown uses of those giant claws. Hopefully the Alioramus can afford the facial reconstruction surgery! Therizinosaurine! by Peter Bond Maniraptors: Therizinosauria by Albertonykus (From shortest to longest: Beipiaosaurus inexpecticus, Falcarius utahensis, and Therizinosaurus cheloniformis .)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The therizinosaurs were a group of strange-looking maniraptors. This caused a lot of confusion in the past. For example, some therizinosaurs (then known as segnosaurs) were thought to be prosauropods (basically all the sauropodomorphs besides the giant four-legged sauropods). It was a while before the segnosaurs and therizinosaurs were recognized as the same group within maniraptor theropods. Therizinosaurs had gigantic claws, but their tiny heads and teeth suggest they were plant eaters. To be fair, they aren\'t the only plant-eating theropods ( [link] ), but few other theropods show such extreme herbivory. &nbsp; &nbsp; Therizinosaurus by Jared Needle From a 13 (or 12) inch square of double MC tissue paper, violet/orange.&nbsp;&nbsp; Still in progress after two months. It has literally been standing like that for a month straight before I photographed it today . It\'s obviously missing a head. I\'ve gone through at least a dozen attempts over the last month, and still have yet to design a satisfactory head. (I also haven\'t had time to work on it.) I am extremely happy with the rest of it. It came out perfect. It just needs a good head. &nbsp; We hope you enjoyed that look at all things Therizinosaurs!&nbsp; Great job, everyone!&nbsp; The new poll is up on the right sidebar, so be sure to vote for July\'s Time Capsule ( wouldn\'t you just LOVE to draw ferns?! Erm... ) As for the next Gallery, the winner of that poll is ... ICHTHYOSAURS ! So be sure to submit your Ichthyosaur by May 1st 2010!&nbsp;&nbsp; To participate in an ART Evolved Gallery, send your art along with a title and a small description to artevolved@gmail.com . We accept art from anybody and everybody ! It\'s hard to believe that only a year ago this site was launched! So much has happened in that time! In actuality, ART Evolved as a concept is a bit older then a year. In December 2008, Peter and myself thought up the idea of a multi-artist p alaeo -art show. However, when we contacted potential participants about such a show, every one of them thought there was enough interest to go a step further and create a proper blog. So for the beginning months of 2009, in secret, we put together and constructed ART Evolved for its official launch in March. It was one year ago to this day that ART Evolved debuted, and it has exceeded any of our original expectations. We have been featured in a magazine , been a\'blog of note\'on Google\'s official Blogger site , and most important of all hosted 6 highly successful Palaeo -art galleries . So to celebrate this epic first year, and to get in some palaeo -art on this big day, we present this B-Day cake created by cake artisan Rhonwyn Vaudrey . So happy blog day to ART Evolved, its members, and participates. We also extend a big thank you to everyone who submitted artwork, wrote posts, or just visited the site for helping to contribute to this great start. Of course it doesn\'t end here. Look for an equally exciting second year right here on ART Evolved! Just a couple more Therizinosaur Live Blogs to bring your attention too. The new comers include: Rachael\'s lino print here Craig and Peter finally launch the first tandem Live Blog. Craig\'s efforts here . Peter\'s here . Zach\'s Therizinosaur has begun here . Sarah begins work on her Therizinosaur here . You can also still check out the previous efforts of: Tricia now has her\'evolution\'of Therizinosaurs live-blogged up on Tricia\'s Obligatory Art Blog !!!

Another view of the Maluti Mountains from Three Fountains in the Free State. For more super sky pictures go to the Skywatch site. Sunrise over the Maluti Mountains in Lesotho taken from the Three Fountains View in the Free State. Go to Skywatch for many more great pictures from around the world.

I think I may stand a better chance with my with my lawyer. .\'Froggy, froggy may we cross your golden river?\'No!\'Why don\'t you rather stop for a while and admire my beauty?\'&nbsp; It\'s amazing what you can find lurking beside the river banks. You can see the big picture or if you look more closely, you&nbsp;may see the little one as well. I came across this little fellow alongside a river in Lesotho and&nbsp;identified him as an Ornate frog (Hildebrandtia ornata). If you are interested in knowing more about these frogs click here . This is the second of my donkey sunsets taken in Lesotho. Come and enjoy the worldwide skywatch experience at the SkyWatc h site. This bald ibis vey obligingly posed for me the other day in Lesotho. I found this sign on a roadside shop&nbsp;in Lesotho quite amusing. I know what chips are, but can only guess what fats are..........needless to say that with my no fat and low cholesterol diet I was not tempted. Aside from the humour, it also shows an entrepreneurial spirit in a harsh environment, where there is a daily struggle to earn a living. This seemed like a desparate, or should I say novel,&nbsp;appeal for business in Molteno.&nbsp;I also see that some of the petals on the flower were sacrificed, to improve the view of the sign. Having just eaten a big breakfast at Aliwal North we did not stop. Then about 50 kilometres from Cradock we stopped at the Daggaboer Farm Stall to browse. For the unenlightened\'dagga\'is\'marijuana\'and\'boer\'is\'farmer\'. Yes, that is the name of the farm. Apparently the name has four possible origins, but only one relates to dagga. If you want&nbsp;to hear these accounts you will have to pop into the&nbsp;farm stall and ask the owner. &nbsp;It is well worth a visit and I can highly recommend the homemade pineapple juice and ginger beer and the roosterbrood (gri,\'le bread) And then, before resuming the journey, you can always stop in at the local loo, to have an\'enjoyable farm pee\'.&nbsp;There is a lot of humour at the Daggaboer Farm Stall. You can also visit them on the net. At one time our travel was aimed at getting from point A to point B as quicly as possible. These days we kind of dawdle along and emjoy the ride, looking for the these types of roadside gems.
think I did with them, they are:1) Michael Ian Black, which appears in this week\'s issue of Time Out New York.2) Scott Weiland, which appears in the December issue of Spin magazine (which also contains an excellent article about Echo and the Bunnymen):3) Emile Hirsch, which I banished to the Time Out New York website because he didn\'t give me enough stuff to work with.AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST, Chasing Ghosts, the documentary in which I am used for comic effect, is airing on Showtime all month.WHY I\'M ANGRY TODAYIt\'s colder than 1,000 Antarcticas outside! Until ten minutes ago, I had completely forgotten that this existed. And when I did remember, I thought it had aired on Fridays, ABC\'s late-night comedy sketch show (costarring Larry David and Michael Richards). Instead, it was the Lorne Michaels-produced The New Show, which only lasted six episodes in 1984. When it aired, I thought this sketch was the funniest thing in the world. Wow.See more funny videos at Funny or DieWHY I\'M ANGRY TODAYWhere my muffin at!? Speaking of Wayne Coyne, the interview was for an upcoming issue of Spin magazine to promote Christmas on Mars, his insanely wacky -- and just plain insane -- debut as a movie director. If you\'ve ever wanted to see Fred Armisen plaintively singing\'Silent Night\'just minutes after a marching band whose members all have vaginas for heads walk over a baby and crush it to death, then by all means go see this movie.And speaking of Spin, its editors have graciously allowed me
Photos Of Borneo ----------- The Borneo Project (Donate!) Borneo - for most, perhaps, the name brings up nothing more than impressions of a vague, far-away and exotic place; others might associate it with headhunting tribes or wild orangutans. For myself, I had memories of intriguing silhouettes on the horizon - massive jungle-clad spires rising from azure seas, cloaked in mist . Passing the island in transit from the Solomon Islands to Bali aboard a tall ship in my late teens, I resolved to return to Borneo. In researching more about this fascinating place, I learned more of it\'s history and natural wonders. The world\'s oldest rain forest, rapidly being destroyed; incomparable scuba diving and snorkeling; local peoples whose traditions still could be experienced first-hand, yet are rapidly changing; and the chance to see rare wildlife such as the Orang-Utan . Lately, too, I had read much about the impact of palm plantations on the destruction of rain forest in this part of the world. In the media, this destruction has been linked to the rapid growth of the biodiesel industry - calling into question the very notion that biofuels will help our societies transition to a more environmentally responsible future. As an advocate of a sustainable biodiesel, I wanted to see and understand the impacts first-hand. A few weeks before the winter holidays, my wife and I discussed possible vacation destinations. At one point we asked each other where it was that we most wanted to travel to, regardless of the practicality. Borneo came to mind, and on a lark almost, we looked into airfares and cost. Surprisingly, we found that if we flew on Christmas day, we could get a really good airfare. So, with only 10 or 12 days to go, we booked our flights and feverishly prepared to fly halfway around the world. What we found was perhaps one of the most active frontiers between wilderness and traditional cultures, and the modern industrial world. As with so much of this tension, much of this revolves around questions of energy, so I wanted to write a bit in my blog about what we observed. First, allow me to situate Borneo in some context. Borneo is the third largest island in the world, larger than Texas, and is shared (not always peacefully) but Malaysia, Indonesia, and Brunei. We visited the Malaysian part of Borneo, consisting of the states of Sabah and Sarawak, running across the northwestern portion of the island; with the exception of the Sultanate of Brunei, which is a small and wealthy pocket between the two states. The interior of Borneo is the very definition of rugged. Never having been glaciated, the landforms are quite dramatic . The rain forest is home to many dangerous animals and even plants - including a tree who\'s sap can kill a man in minutes if it so much as touches a small open wound. Just moving through the forest is exhausting - even on a trail. The thin soil barely covers the uneven and razor-sharp limestone geology. Even on flat ground the pockmarked terrain conspires with thick tree roots that criss-cross the ground to create a forest floor seemingly designed to trip and twist the ankle of the unwary . The lowlands are largely submerged in a foot or two of tea-colored swamp, and are home to several different flavors of leech which inevitably attach themselves to inconvenient areas of the body. Massive walls of limestone rise at a punishing angles from the lowlands, creating ridgelines that are extremely difficult to traverse. A jungle trek in Borneo, even today, is an adventure . This kept colonizers - first Indian Rajahs, then the English\'white Rajas\'- marginalized in their real control of the territory to the coasts. Many of the indigenous Dayak peoples that live in Borneo only had regular contact with the outside world (primarily missionaries) starting in the 50\'s. Headhunting was a regular activity of these peoples up until World War Two at least, with many invading Japanese soldiers losing their heads to traditional, barefooted warriors armed only with machetes and blowpipes (and it should be noted, many groups were systematically slaughtered by the Japanese in retribution). We met elders who had fought and taken heads as young men, and had the tattoos to prove it. Because Borneo is so rugged, until recently all travel was on the river systems (river travel is still by far the easiest way to get around) and almost all of the peoples lived their lives on the rivers and forests immediately adjacent. As could be expected, the rain forest is a rather inhospitable place for outsiders wishing to exploit the resources. In contrast, for the indigenous peoples, the forest is their traditional supermarket, pharmacy, hardware store and lumber yard. Our guide, of Iban extraction, showed us dozens of unremarkable looking plants just off the trail, each of which had numerous uses. The semi-nomadic Dayak have lived in these forests for many centuries (at least) and their traditional culture is exquisitely intertwined with it. Our guide lives in an apartment, spends a lot of time of his cell phone, promptly answers his email, and flies between cities to meet his clients. Yet, as a youth, he learned to make fifty different kinds of traps and to hunt with a blowpipe. He estimates that he could survive for at least a month in jungle if he was dropped into it with nothing but the clothes on this back. Nonetheless, exploitation of the forests has proceeded apace since the 1960\'s or so; beginning with logging of tropical hardwoods. The lowlands have been drained to allow access for bulldozers, lumber trucks and a massive amount of inexpensive labor (largely Indonesian workers). A lot of this logging is now on the third or fourth pass over the more accessible areas, with smaller and smaller trees being taken out. Now that the economically extractable timber is dwindling, much land is being cleared outright, primarily for palm oil plantations. These plantations form the backbone of a tropical oleo-economy that may be as economically and ecologically significant as the corn and soy agricultural economy of North America. Those of you that follow the debates over biofuels are no doubt familiar with palm oil. This crop produces very high yields of oil from its fruits. It is farmed as a monoculture, with oil extracted using industrial-scale processes to yield a wide variety of products ranging from edible oils to chemical feedstocks. What most people seem unaware of, with all the hand-wringing about biofuels is that even without the influence of biodiesel, the spread of oil palm plantations seems inevitable. Palm oil is a crucial source of cheap calories throughout the tropical developing world. Almost all fried food in Southeast Asia and India is cooked in palm oil, and proprietors of roadside stands and small restaurants thrive or fail by the market price of this commodity. The Malaysian Palm Oil Council indicates that 90% of palm oil is consumed as food, with the remaining portion used in non-food applications (including biodiesel). This is worth repeating - at present, less than 10% of the palm oil produced globally is used to make biodiesel. The vast majority is consumed. While we were in Borneo, Malaysia was in a several day uproar over a rumor of palm oil rationing; of course, Malaysia is one of the largest producers of palm oil, but the export market had apparently squeezed domestic supply. Palm oil derived chemicals are found in many every day products like shampoo, cosmetics, and processed foods. Palm oil has even been proposed as (irony alert) an\'environmentally sensitive\'drilling fluid for deep-sea petroleum exploration . However, that said, the demand for high-yield oil crops to serve biodiesel demand - predominately from Europe - has lead to something of a gold rush mentality among palm oil plantation owners, who are enthusiastically clearing land in preparation for exponentially increasing demand; it takes nearly 3 years from the time a plantation is put in until the point the palms bear the oil-rich fruit. The increasing demand for palm oil and lag time until the plantations bear inevitably leads to boom and bust cycles. The current high price of palm oil fuels two contentious debates with regards to bio-based energy - global warming impact (from forest clearing) and the food vs. fuel controversy . Recently, the European Union proposed a sustainability certification scheme that would preclude the use of most palm-oil based biodiesel. This seems prudent and wise, but to date, is only a proposal. So now to the situation on the ground, by air. As I noted, until recently, the only practical way to get around Borneo was by river. However, this is no longer the case. Malaysian Borneo is now served by an excellent and affordable network of airlines, mostly flying Airbus A300\'s on longer routes to the bigger airports, and twin-engine turboprops (Twin Otters and Fokker 50\'s) to the smaller destinations. Our experience with air travel in Malaysia is that it matches or exceeds one\'s experience in the US, both in terms of cost and comfort. It is also an excellent opportunity to see the lay of the land. In many places, what you observe is oil palm plantations as far as the eye can see. The vastness of this is hard to overstate. One can see huge areas cleared to bare soil , with neat grids of access roads, ready to to be planted; and similarly, undulating rows of palms in various states of maturity, often surrounding isolated islands of jungle atop inaccessible spires. On the ground, the experience is repeated. Driving from the airport in Tawau to the dive spot gateway of Semporna, about an hour away, one sees virtually nothing but these plantations . It is a sobering experience to think of the biodiversity that has been annihilated by these massive developments. It is also difficult to overstate the impact on the Dayak both by the plantations and the logging. Many Dayak have moved to the cities and live very modern lives, and especially some Iban groups do enjoy political power and influence. Thus, there are certainly some cases where the indigenous groups have benefited economically - at least in the short term - by these activities. By and large, however, the lions share of the economic benefit has gone directly to the largely Chinese companies which run the logging operations and plantations, and indirectly to the mainland Malay who enable this exploitation from a political perspective. Most of the labor, as mentioned, is imported from Indonesia. We visited a longhouse as part of a backpacking trip in Mulu park. This longhouse is a traditional structure where an entire village lives under one roof. In practice, this is essentially an enormous low-rise apartment building with a large common veranda in front. The people of this longhouse still make much of their livelihood from the forest. The tourists that visit come to see the protected areas of the national park that abut these communities, even while some of the same people involved in the tourism trade illegally hunt wild boar inside the park boundaries (as they have for hundreds of years). One of the main cash trade activities is gathering wild fruit, particularly durian, from the jungle; as wild-harvested durian is considered to be the best of this sought-after delicacy and commands a high price in urban markets . The people who live in the longhouses still look to the forest, in short, for food, medicine, and building materials. Thus, many logging concessions have met with significant protest by the indigeous people, including road blockades met with government violence . We spoke to one park guide who had been active in such a movement in his home village, who had been imprisoned and beaten. In turn, he and his compatriots fashioned handcuffs from sharp-edged jungle leaves and built a jail with walls of poisonous thorns, and informed the police that unauthorized incursions on their territory from them or any loggers would be similarly met with imprisonment. In the end, such confrontation is only a delaying tactic, and this guide recognized that the only way to preserve the forest, is for the forest to produce economic activity for his village. Otherwise, there is temptation to fall prey to divide-and-conquer tactics on the part of the logging companies like substantial payoffs to prominent individuals to allow logging and plantations. While one solution is official government protection of the lands, Malaysia has at times resorted to fairly heavy-handed tactics in the establishment of these national parks. For instance, on the outskirts of Mulu park there is a Penan\'settlement\'where the primary activity is sales of handicrafts (trinkets really) to tourists. The Penan are not there by choice. As a semi-nomadic people with a hunter-gatherer culture that has changed little since the Stone Age, they were judged by the government to not be compatible with the establishment of a national park and were enticed (or forced) from their traditional lands about 15 years ago. They were told to choose between being Muslim or Christian, the government built homes, a church (they chose Christian mostly because being Muslim would preclude them from hunting forest game), and a school and have tried to teach them to practice agriculture. They were the most economically and culturally depressed people that we met in Borneo. Without a doubt, this sort of thing has lead to undeniable ethnic tensions in Borneo. Malaysia advertises and prides itself on being a multi-ethnic and harmonious state, but in practice relations seem strained at best. We met a ethnic Chinese taxi driver who told us not to trust any ethic Malays (as we would be ripped off); Malays who were horrified that we would hire an ethnic Chinese taxi driver (as we would be ripped off); and indigenous people who had no love lost for either group, or migrant Indonesian workers, and were deeply concerned about ethnic tensions and resource exploitation exploding into outright sectarian violence (as has occurred periodically in Indonesia). The ironic thing of course is that we were treated fantastically by everyone we met of every ethnicity; although of course, as Americans traveling in a majority-Muslim country, we were often offered direct opinions and confrontational questions about our government\'s foreign policies. Even as the indigenous people fight to preserve and to have access to their traditional lands, it should be recognized that the tide of modernization is not, on the whole, leaving them behind. It was no coincidence that at the longhouse, we saw few men of working age; mostly old people, children, and some young women with families. One of the activities we participated in the longhouse was a presentation and participation in traditional music and dancing . During this, one of the few young indigenous men around was taking pictures of the dancing with his digital camera - he was clearly home on a break. We met a large number of youngsters that spoke flawless English and were getting ready for their big exams to get into secondary school and then, they hoped, into university. The interior of the apartments we saw were heavy with photos of graduates in caps and gowns; the resident\'s children and grandchildren. The longhouse itself - though poor by first world standards - had electricity, indoor plumbing, refrigeration , and satellite TV in many apartments. The level of material wealth present - compared, for instance, to rural Africa - was very high. That Malaysia - even in these outlying areas - is not a poor country comes back to the theme of this blog once again. The petroleum industry in Malaysia is the engine. The Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpar are one of the most impressive man-made sights I have ever seen in my life. These edifices were not built on palm oil profits, obviously. Malaysia\'s\'asian tiger\'status is largely a function of oil wealth. Their policies are leading to significant investment in education for its citizens, and economic diversification (towards the semiconductor industry for instance) which is wise. However, there is a clear sense of striving towards ever increasing material wealth that is already dramatically impacting the preservation of cultural diversity, as Malaysians of all ethnicities embrace a homogenized cultural mieleu, seemingly centered on American pop music, Japanese fashion, and the most impressive shopping malls one could imagine. It seemed to me that perhaps the most popular recreational activity for young Malaysians of any ethnicity is to spend the day packed like sardines into a\'cybercafe\'where they play games (Counterstrike, Grand Theft Auto, and World of Warcraft seemed popular), IM, and watch YouTube. At about $1 per hour to enjoy air-con, entertainment, and socializing it is indeed a good value. It is, frankly, an open question whether the rain forest of Borneo can be meaningfully preserved in the face of this dynamic. Hand in hand with this, preservation of traditional cultural knowledge is in question; of course, the Dayak of Borneo have and will continue to adapt their cultural response to circumstances. It is likely, as in other circumstances, that the young Dayak will realize that their cultural heritage is fading and will work to reconstitute their traditions and identities. Still, inevitably much will be lost - especially if the forest is destroyed. Again, from the perspective of this blog, the question is whether renewable energy is working as a constructive and destructive force. For the Dayak that have installed micro-hydro run of river systems and now enjoy electrification, this serves to strengthen their local economy and this in turn helps them preserve the forest. Conversely, if the West sources it\'s biofuel feedstock from palm oil, Borneo\'s transformation may be irreversible and complete. In this case, the fate of the Dayak may follow that of other indigenous groups who\'s values, lifestyle, and location are not compatible with massive resource exploitation. Let us hope that this does not come to pass. As a closing note, I can recommend The Borneo Project as a group that is doing great to help the various groups in Borneo achieve sustainable economic activity and thereby preserve the rain forest. Please donate (link at top). Yesterday, the Berkeley City Council unanimously approved an ordinance that will finance PV systems and energy efficiency improvements for homeowners in the city. Though the plan was announced last week, I haven\'t had a chance to blog so this is as good a time as ever to write a few words about it. When I first heard of this, it struck me as one of those\'only in Berkeley\'type things and rubbed my libertarian streak the wrong way, leading to ornery thoughts. It\'s been a long time coming, right? How come the private sector can\'t get it together to provide financing for residential PV? It has always seemed like a fantastic opportunity for an entrepreneurial approach, so it seems like Berkeley is competing directly with private enterprise here. But can you usurp private enterprise, if the service isn\'t really being offered by the private sector? I guess not. I\'ve come around. The way this is structured is actually brilliant and everyone wins. So in a nutshell, the deal is that the City pays the upfront cost for the installed system. Then, an assessment is a,\'ed to the property tax, and through this assessment, the homeowner pays the City back with interest over 20 years. So here are the main points: First, (assuming the system is sized properly) the assessment is less than the utility savings, so it is cash-flow positive for the homeowner; and of course after 20 years, it\'s free power. Second, the system and the assessment belong to the property, not to the homeowner. This is critical. It means that value of the system will be properly appraised as part of the property, so there is no risk of losing the value of the system upon sale of the house. Moreover, whether an owner stays in the house for 1 year or 30 years, they still see all upside. Third, the City is raising the money with a municipal bond; the lowest interest rate anywhere; passing this through to the homeowner helps make the economics compelling. Fourth, the City gets a guaranteed revenue stream. The biggest issue that I see is that demand in Berkeley is going to utterly explode. I have a hard time imagining that nearly every homeowner in Berkeley who gets wind of this won\'t try to sign up. I don\'t know how any of the local installers will keep up, in the short term at least. This sounds like a nice problem to have, but of course the concern is that there could be a proliferation of naive, and in all probability (like in any\'gold rush\') some opportunistic new installers and service providers doing this work -- and doing a bad job. Of course most new entrants will be honest and competent, but it\'s the inevitable bad apples that worry me. Balancing exceptional industry growth and the need for installers to support that growth are the realities that properly installing 30-year service life equipment is not easy, there is a rather complex set of reliability, safety, and regulatory / rebate issues to grapple with, and customers who may not have realistic expectations due to relentless solar hype are not necessarily the easiest to please. The other substantive concern I have is if the contract with the City (and thus the assessment) includes periodic inverter replacements, or whether the homeowner is on the hook for it on their own. Modules are typically guaranteed to product at least 80% of their rated power after 25 years, but most inverters carry a 10 year warranty. This means it is very likely that at least one inverter replacement at the owner\'s cost over the system lifetime, and possibly two, will be required. At a couple thousand bucks a pop (depending on size) this has implications for system economics. An honest and professional assessment of system economics should assume these maintenance costs as well as the slow degradation in power output. The inverter issue is quite problematic if a new owner moves in just before the inverter fails out of warranty, and then has to either shell out cash for the equipment, pay the assessment even though they are getting no benefit, or try to get the property assessment canceled (in which case the city is left holding the bag). The city says it will roll out the plan in about 8 months, so hopefully will have the foresight to a,\'ress this issue. All that said, assuming this doesn\'t get bungled up in red tape or political shenanigans -- and there\'s never a guarantee there, especially in B-town -- it seems inevitable that this idea will spread quickly. One of the most interesting aspects of solar these days is the leadership of the states in successfully setting de facto national energy policy in the current leadership vacuum at the Federal level. It appears that Berkeley has taken this one step further. Potentially, this initiative could serve as a seed crystal for a concept that could radically impact the way we produce electricity, nationally, even internationally - one town at a time. There is an excellent article on biofuels in the October National Geographic . It does the best job I\'ve seen in any mainstream publication - perhaps in any publication - of elucidating the importance of feedstocks to the sustainability and ultimately feasibility of biofuels. The article touches on both ethanol and biodiesel. With ethanol, the article focuses on corn, sugarcane (and the Brazilian experience), and celluosic feedstocks and the tradeoffs of each. For biodiesel, soy is discussed but algae also gets significant attention, including a rare behind-the-fence photo at the Greenfuels plant in Arizona. I highly recommend picking it up for a read. It also includes a fascinating article about modern pirates in Southeast Asia. So you really can\'t go wrong. In other news, Solar Power 2007 was great last week. It was fun to see old friends and colleagues and there was a fantastic sense of momentum. My presentation on innovation drivers for balance of system components seemed a success, with some good questions, so that was very satisfying. I only made a couple of the other talks, the CEO forum and the closing plenary. The forum was quite interesting, with some good questions and it seemed, frank answers. Main fact - national SEIA had a lobbying budget of just $20,000 last year and the goal this year is just $60,000. This was to me, just astonishing given the amount of money spent in Washington by the mainstream energy industry. The highlight of the closing plenary was a tour-de-force presentation by the senior energy manager of Wal-Mart . I was not aware that they are far ahead of the pack in terms of energy efficiency in their stores, though of course I had heard of the solar roll-out. Apparently this is just a pilot and if successful, Wal-Mart has a policy and track record of rolling out energy innovations massively. That is truly exciting stuff. I\'ve been thinking about this next post for a bit now. I haven\'t had time to write anything lately but hopefully, I\'ll be able to post somewhat consistently over the next few months. What\'s on my mind is giving some advice to the those that seek a job in the solar industry. There are lots of opportunities out there for the right people, and it\'s a good time to get your foot in the door. At the same time, as has been noted before, the hype machine is in overdrive. So buyer beware, especially if your livelihood is riding on it. So let me first start with a cautionary tale. On Friday, the entire board of directors and CEO of Automatic Tooling Systems (ATS) , the Canadian company that owned Spheral Solar (and conventional module manufacturer PhotoWatt ), resigned in the face of\'dissident hedge fund\'shareholders demanding a turnaround . ATS\'s foray into renewable energy (as well as auto industry woes) was blamed for this sory state of affairs. Spheral Solar was actually shut down earier this year and ATS tried to spin off PhotoWatt in an IPO in late March, but failed . Previously, Spheral was touted as the best thing since sliced bread, an amazing technology that allowed them to make flexible modules, with significantly less silicon, that (in theory at least) boasted near crystalline PV efficiency. Four years ago, the\'New Scientist\'wrote this breathless article about\'demin\' solar panels to clothe future buildings\'; and Future Pundit wrote that Spheral would\'start production in 2004\'Yet as late as January 2006 the\'Clean Break\'blog opined, referring to a deal between building products manufacturer Elk (recently acquired by GAF) and Spheral to make building-integrated roofing materials with the technlogy, that\'the product is sold before it\'s even been produced. Now that\'s the kind of certainty that investors like\'. Well, maybe so, but of course that only works out if the company manages to manufacture their technology on a commercial scale. If you\'ve been following the solar industry for any length of time, you come to realize that announcements from a company of the intent to produce, or the ability to produce, or even signed contracts to manufacture and install their technologies means very little if they don\'t have a track record of doing so (especially if they announced, and then failed, to go into production two years prior). The point of this cautionary tale is that there are a lot of solar companies out there these days, and there are all sots of announcements and blog posts and what-have-you that make them look like just the greatest new thing. Be skeptical, and be smart, because in the next 5 years or so I think we\'re going to see a significant shake-out occur in this business. If you are looking for a job, gut-check the risk level you are willing to take. If there are only a few employees, promises of lots of options, some venture funding and a prototype out in a garage - well, that\'s a high risk situation. Potentially high reward if it actually does work out of course. But a day of reckoning will come for all start-ups, especially if VC funded. There are a number of well known, seemingly reputable companies that have been around for years now and have yet to set up even modest manufacturing capacity or field a market-ready (i.e. all required certifications) product. There\'s even one which shall remain unnamed, based in Silicon Valley, which is infamous for being extraordinarily well funded - yet no one I\'ve spoken to has even seen a prototype of their breakthrough technology. That\'s all well and good for a while but after several years have passed, one must begin to wonder. Conversely, there are more established players with a reputation, products, vision, and great growth potential; but less speculative upside. Look at the bigger pattern, the fundamentals, if you will. There\'s nothing new under the sun (ahem). Thin film was the the Next Big Thing five or six years ago, unfortunately, there were some serious reliability issues and so much for that. Now it\'s back in vogue. Not coincidentally, this new generation of thin film technologies (most of which is not yet commercialized) arose simultaneously with a rather prolonged shortage of polysilicon, the raw material of relatively high-efficiency crystalline solar cells. Same with concentrating photovoltaics, which saw a lot of effort in the \'80s and up until the mid \'90s, then largely abandoned as the price of 1-sun cells came down; but resurged with poly shortage driving silicon prices up. The high prices made thin film and CPV look good - trading significantly less silicon usage for low efficiency and mechanical / optical complexity, respectively. So now it\'s two or three years later. Some of these new innovators have already fallen by the wayside, others are still working towards commercialization, and one German thin film company made it past the finish line in time and is raking it in (and good for them!). But it seems that in the opinion of most analysts, the poly situation is already relaxing as many new plants come online. The question is, will these thin film and CPV solutions still be attractive in a world that is not silicon-constrained? In a world where the PV market is being flooded by low-cost, mid-efficiency crystalline PV technology from China while a few of the more technologically positioned crystalline PV players duke it out for high-efficiency dominance, and where vertical integration appears to bring some distinct advantages? Finally factor in that solar thermal powerplant technology (like the SEGS plants or, for a less proven example, Stirling dishes) looks pretty attractive for the really big centralized solar power plant market. In other words, who\'s going to win? It\'s a tough one but that\'s a question I would recommend answering to your own satisfaction before choosing to sign on the dotted line. Now the foregoing was perhaps more focused on the tech-type jobs but there are other opportunities out there. For instance, there are any number of installation companies out there ranging from Mom and Pops to installers that are becoming regional or even national players, catering to the residential retrofit and commercial markets. It\'s physical, outdoor construction work. If you have the right skill-set it\'s a good job and you\'re bound to learn something about solar. But still, do your homework, understand their business plan, and understand how the job might change if your employer goes public or gets acquired - and don\'t be shy about asking a potential employer about, specifically, what\'s in it for you in one of these cases. So - the best of luck to all those interested in getting a job in this space. If you are serious, I can definitely recommend showing up at Solar Power 2007 in Long Beach (September 24-27) and getting your own impression of the industry. There\'s even a Career Center and a\'Find Your Dream Job In Solar\'seminar. TED global recently posted some extremely interesting talks from the June, 2007 conference in Arusha, Tanzania. Among the featured speakers was William Kamkwamba, the young man from Malawi who built a homemade wind turbine for his family (see previous post ). I highly recommend the videos; two in particular are extraordinarily powerful and captivating. Moreover, they are primarily focused on identifying and strengthing positive trends, which is a refreshing change from the litany of negativity often found when Africa is discuessed. George Ayittey , a Ghanan economist, takes no prisoners in his powerful indictment of the corruption of Africa\'s elites while la
Because of the success of Twister and Storm Chasers, when most people think of storm chasers, they think of supergeek alpha males hauling butt over the shattered debris of saner men as they skirt the edge of a city-eating tornado.  While this is actually a surprisingly accurate description of a small number of chasers, what often gets lost in the editing is the sheer amount of miles that are driven in a given chase season.  (In the two weeks that I tailed Vortex 2, I racked up over 4,000 miles.  I think the V2 total was over 10,000 miles -- that\'s three oil changes in the course of a month.)  With those kinds of miles come breakdowns, especially in the case some of the more interesting vehicles, such as IMAX director Sean Casey\'s uparmored tank-like contraption, TIV 2.  (In fact, if you\'ve ever watched Storm Chasers, you know that it seems Mr. Casey\'s TIVs break down all the time.  While this may seem like weird workmanship, there\'s a reason why automobile eningeers get paid so much -- you start a,\'ing a few extra tons to the chassis of a stock vehicle and putting 15,000 miles of rough driving a year on it, you\'re going to have a lot of service stops.) Above is a photo of Sean defusing a bomb rejiggering some wiring underneath his TIV2 in Kimball, Nebraska, June 5, 2009.   This was the day he (and Project Vortex 2) got a successful intercept in Wyoming and the day that Sean finally got the shot he\'d been seeking for eight long years. Today\'s photo is a shot of my usual chase vehicle -- nothing much to speak of, really, considering that I don\'t have any antennas sticking out of it or lightbars atop of it or anything like that.  I don\'t keep much expensive stuff in it, either; I think next year I may even try to go without the laptop and rely entirely on an iPod touch on mobile wifi

That was a great vacation from blogging.... O.k. folks time to get back to the Kitchen....!!!!!!!! But first.... we have quite a few frustrated recipe submitters and I apologize for the delay in getting them up. Will do the best I can over the next couple of weeks to cover them all. But first is first... Remember the post on Truly Useless Kitchen Gadgets For The Chef Who Has Everything well quite a few people disagree with me..which is of course GREAT! One wrote a letter and did not leave a comment, but here it is.... Just wanted to comment on this not-so-useless device. If you do a lot of canning, you would like to have a sturdy jar lifter. After you have processed your preserves in boiling water for 15 minutes, you grab the wooden handles and put the red rubber curved ends under the boiling water around the neck of the finished jars and lift them out. this allows you to process the next batch without waiting for the water to cool enough to take out the first batch. Your picture is upside down. Elizabeth Gleghorn, MD Director, Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition Children\'s Hospital Oakland Well this just goes to show you that one person\'s useless device is Gold for another. And that is a good thing... So I apologize if I offended anyone with the useless devices in the kitchen, and if you think they are important then by all means... GO FOR IT!! Well Passover is upon us in a few days, so I got to go clean...UGH! But I will be posting recipes almost daily...so enjoy...and Help! I Have A Fire In My Kitchen is back..back..back!

I Have A Fire In My Kitchen\'http://fireinmykitchen.blogspot.com/ This is a new one on me. Barbara over at\'Barbara\'s Tchatzkahs\'who recently sent in the recipe Muffin Meatloaf And Potatoes a la Barbara , now gives us a recipe from the\'old country\'and her grandmother. Here is what she writes: Today I was digging through more boxes from parents which I had in storage. My mother passed 7 years ago and I knew she had my some of Nana\'s recipes in her things somewhere. My Nana, of blessed memory, was one of the best cooks I have ever known. The oldest of 13 children and the daughter of 2 immigrants who ran from the Pogroms in Poland, she could make a gourmet meal out of a crust of bread and a carrot! Well, almost. And I found some of them!! Many of them are for baked goods (will share later) but I found her recipe for Harvard Beets in my Nana\'s handwriting. While I only like beets in borscht, this was a favorite with most of the rest of my family. Hope you can use this - I think she\'d be amazed her recipes can be immortalized on the Internet now! Barbara O.k. all this is great. But first thing is first. I had to know why they are called\'Harvard\'Beets, and not just plain beets. So I went over to foodreference.com and this is what I found. Harvard beets are cooked beets in a sweet and sour sauce of vinegar and sugar (with spices) and sometimes with butter and/or orange juice. Supposedly created by a Harvard student (or a Yale student), there is also a story that they originated in a tavern in England named \'Harwood\' and the \'Harvard\' is a mispronunciation of the name. So there ya go. The reason for Harvard in Harvard beets. And now to the recipe! Nana Cecelia\'s Harvard Beets Ingredients: 2 1/2 cups of diced, cooked beets 1/2 cup vinegar 1/2 cup sugar 1/2 Tablespoon cornstarch 2 Tablespoon(s) butter salt to taste Utensils You Need: Pot for Stove Top Recipe Directions: Dice and boil beets until the are soft all the way through (test with a knife) Mix sugar, cornstarch and vinegar. Bring this to a boil and a,\' beets. Cover and take off heat and let stand about 20 minutes. A,\' salt to taste and butter and return to low heat until beets are warm. Serve. Really, is very easy. Though I am not a beet lover. You can a,\' orange juice which is also in most of the recipes I have seen as well. My father loved borscht with sour cream. I never did get a taste for it, but every time beets are served, I am reminded of eating Sunday Morning breakfast in\'Steinbergs Restaurant\'which was on the east side of Broadway between 83rd and 84th street. Amazing what memories a simple food dish can conjure!

I Have A Fire In My Kitchen\'http://fireinmykitchen.blogspot.com/ I find it incredibly revealing to look at the statistics on the blog from time to time. Especially what people search for and what recipes they are looking for. Consistently, over the year, two different categories rate the highest. The Mac &amp; Cheese recipes and Lemon Meringue Pie . Now, personally I do understand the desire to create a great Lemon Meringue Pie but Mac &amp; Cheese is just so... well so easy, right? I am not really sure how to interpret this. We are talking literally way over 10,000 (ten thousand) hits during the year on Mac &amp; Cheese recipes! I would tend to think that simply put many people are looking for the simple, easy, and good recipes with which they can eat and feed their families without too much bother and fuss. And many of these people are simply not chefs and cooks, and want an easy way to make good food. Which is something I suspected for a very long time. But I may be reading the statistics in a way I want to see them, however, nevertheless the fact remains the Mac &amp; Cheese recipes @ Help! I Have A Fire In My Kitchen are very popular with Internet searches. So in honor of this we are going to present yet another Mac &amp; Cheese (coupled with mushrooms) today. Macaroni &amp; Cheese With Mushrooms Ingredients: Conchiglie Pipe Rigate One bag of Pasta - (I usually use either conchiglie (shells) or pipe rigate (elbow shells) - This should be about 1/2 Kilo or 1 pound . You can of course make less or more, depending on how many people you need to feed! Grated Cheese - Once again you can use any cheese you like. I use Mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. You will need around 400 grams of Mozzarella (14 ounces) and 100 grams (4 ounces) of Parmesan. Olive Oil - For the bottom of the pan that you put in the oven. Fresh Mushrooms (I really do not like the canned or bottled mushrooms - but you can use them as well!). 1 Teaspoon fresh Oregano (just a touch) or you can use the spice jar. 1 Tablespoon of Salted Butter - My sister a,\'s this, I do not. Your choice. Pepper &amp; Salt to taste Utensils You Need: Oven Tempered Pot or Silver Foil Pan Colander (Food Strainer) Pot To Boil Pasta Recipe Directions: First you have to get that pasta (macaroni) ready. So put it on the stove in water, (cover the macaroni and a,\' about another 1/3 of water to the pot. Let it cook on the flame between 12-18 minutes. The Macaroni should be soft to the touch when you are done but not soggy! So this timing is really a matter of experience believe it or not, cause it should be an almost exact science! While the Macaroni is boiling on stove stop - cut up the mushrooms and get the oven pot ready by spreading a bit of olive oil on the bottom. Pre-Heat Oven to 350º Fahrenheit. When the Macaroni is ready (remember soft not soggy! don\'t let it cook too much!) pick up the pot and pour it all in the Colander so now you get rid of the water. Now put the Macaroni into your oven ready dish. Take around 100 grams of the Mozzarella cheese and put on top. If you are going to a,\' butter just drop it on the top A,\' the Oregano on top. Now mix it all together - (cheese, butter and Oregano.) Now mix in all the cut-up mushrooms. ( ACK! Forgot this step! Kali found the omission! ) Now take the rest of the Mozzarella and sprinkle it all around the top. Don\'t mix it in. This is the cheese cover. Now take the Parmesan cheese and sprinkle it around the mi,\'le or around the sides, any which way you like. (See the photo above) In the end you should have a cheese top. Now cover the dish with silver foil - do NOT put that dish in the oven without it being covered! Otherwise the cheese will not melt at a rate that the Macaroni (pasta) is cooked. Now believe it or not, this depends on the temperament of your oven. When my oven is having a bad hair day it needs say 60-75 minutes. On a day when the oven is in a good mood and does not want to do some nasty stuff to me it takes 60 minutes! What you want to end up with, is a melted cheese on top and the pasta cooked evenly. I use a glass dish so I can see the macaroni next to the glass. My kids like it crusty! Now take that silver foil off, and let the dish cook for 5 minutes, so the cheese turns a nice light golden brown. Don\'t burn it so be careful here! Take it out - Serve or let it cool off and put in the fridge until ready to be heated up and served. By the way this is one of those special dishes that I say - go ahead and nuke a part of it when you want to heat it up real fast and you take it from the fridge. (2-3 minutes in the Microwave is usually enough!) There ya go - another Mac &amp; Cheese! Enjoy. I love rating my own recipes. Our insane cook Paula cannot say a thing. HAH! But this is really a two - I kid you not. Not hard, easy on the hands, concentration and kitchen. Enjoy it!

I Have A Fire In My Kitchen\'http://fireinmykitchen.blogspot.com/ The Big Book of Diabetic Desserts Decadent And Delicious Recipes Perfect For People With Diabetes By: Jackie Mills (---Due to layout of this review, if viewed in an RSS reader, certain sections may seem duplicated.) Before we begin, the review of the The Big Book of Diabetic Desserts the normal disclaimer from Help! I Have A Fire In My Kitchen. This book review was solicited by the publicists of the The Big Book of Diabetic Desserts and contains my personal opinion of the book. For kosher readers of Help! I Have A Fire In My Kitchen - This is not a\'kosher\'cookbook though the majority of recipes in the The Big Book of Diabetic Desserts can be used as is, or with just a few sane and healthy substitutions, can be kept kosher. It is not that difficult to find equivalent and healthy kosher substitutes these days, especially in the United States. Author &amp; Book Details: The Big Book of Diabetic Desserts is the second diabetic cookbook written by Jackie Mills, MS, RD. The other one is Type 2 Diabetes Cookbook: Delicious Recipes for Healthier Living (Published by: American Medical Association) . Of course these two books together should give the reader some idea as to where the interests of Jackie Mills lie when it comes to the kitchen. Jackie Mills, MS, RD, is an experienced writer and food/recipe writer. She contributes to many national magazines, including Cooking Light, Family Circle, Cottage Living, and Coastal Living. She was the recipe developer for the American Medical Association\'s Type 2 Diabetes Cookbook and has contributed to Weight Watchers cookbooks and Christmas with Southern Living annual cookbooks. Jackie is the former food editor at Redbook magazine and worked as an associate food editor at Southern Living magazine. She lives in New York City. The Book Itself: Some of these recipes are absolutely INCEDIBLE! Forget the word diabetes for a moment. They really are impressive. Man, oh man, just the names of these recipes gets your stomach juices running. But the recipes themselves are truly an art as well and Jackie Mills does not disappoint! There is no doubt Jackie Mills comes with qualifications to write such a cookbook. This is though, the first time I am actually faced with the old yet very important discussion of form versus function . One gets used to and is spoiled by incredible photographs in cook books of almost every single recipe published. Indeed, it is almost a prerequisite these days in the Cookbook publishing industry. And to be honest I was at first a bit disappointed that The Big Book of Diabetic Desserts did not have such pictures, especially since it deals with the topic of desserts as they usually do make the best pictures. Instead the publishers opted for a few pictures in the mi,\'le of the book. So as in regard to form I was somewhat surprised. But, and this is a BIG BUT , The Big Book of Diabetic Desserts has an important function , and must also be judged on whether it fulfills that function as well. Pictures will not make or break your needs of food especially if you are a diabetic, but certainly recipes will. The better the recipe the more encouraged a diabetic, or someone just interested in making sure they stay healthy, and on the lighter side of sugar, will continue using the book - and more important continue on their specialized diet. There is one more confusing aspect of this book, and though the book itself will get high marks, as it truly does contain\'Decadent And Delicious Recipes Perfect For People With Diabetes\'this is an oversight which really has no excuse. There simply is no overall\'Table of Contents\'. Though the book itself is divided into sections, and each section has its own Table of Contents of the recipes in it, the only real way to find anything is to flip to the back index and begin to look quickly. Indeed in order to discover all the yummy sections in the book, I had to flip through, page by page to mark off each section when I found it. So you will have the benefit of my work! The Big Book of Diabetic Desserts has an important function, and must also be judged on whether it fulfills that function as well. Pictures will not make or break your needs of food especially if you are a diabetic, but certainly recipes will. The better the recipe the more encouraged a diabetic, or someone just interested in making sure they stay healthy, and on the lighter side of sugar, will continue using the book - and more important continue on their specialized diet. However, this is really an oversight of the layout artists, though it is a mistake and an important one that should have been caught before the book was published. Cookbooks require a Table of Contents at the front. Simple as all that. Yet, and while some of the readers of Help! I Have A Fire In My Kitchen may not agree, I am willing to go easy with the lack of the Table of Contents because the book\'s function is to produce recipes for the diabetic population, and it is published by the American Diabetes Association and all proceeds from the book go to this worthy charity. Thus, major mistakes which would get me to cringe in a recipe cookbook where the author is making all the royalties, will in this case get a mild critique and one should be willing to forgive such things in this case. So let us get positive now. The public relations piece that came along with the book is quoted below. We tend to dismiss such things, but in this case the book deserves it and you will see why later on. From Chocolate Souffles To Blackberry-Pecan Tarts, New Cookbook Offers Dozens Of Sumptuous Desserts That Are Low In Sugar And Fat Whatever treat one\'s sweet tooth craves -- cakes, pies, cookies, pu,\'ings -- decadent desserts are often the hardest thing to give up when on a diet. Whether someone is watching calories and fat, or is living with diabetes, limiting sweets has long been the rule -- and those who seek to substitute with sugar-free, fat-free versions of their favorite desserts are often sorely disappointed. This no longer need be the case. The Big Book of Diabetic Desserts , Decadent And Delicious Recipes Perfect For People With Diabetes, by dietitian and former Redbook food editor Jackie Mills, MS, RD (American Diabetes Association, November 2007) offers dozens of delicious concoctions -- all developed to be lower in carbohydrates, calories, and fat. From Mocha Fudge Sheet Cake to Banana Meringue Pie and from Cappuccino Crème Brûlée to Crispy Oatmeal-Raisin Cookies, most of the recipes in The Big Book of Diabetic Desserts use a combination of granulated sugar, brown sugar, honey, or molasses along with the no-calorie sweetener sucralose (Splenda®). The limited amount of sugar makes the desserts mouth-watering and enjoyable, but with carb counts that enable them to fit into a balanced meal plan. In a,\'ition, all the choices in the new book contain less than 1.5 grams of saturated fat per serving and virtually no trans fat. Despite the drawbacks mentioned above, there is a great deal of good to say about The Big Book of Diabetic Desserts. All in all it is a cookbook well worth the effort and price, especially if you have a diabetic to feed. No one is going to believe these deserts are for diabetics anyway. So you will only gain in your reputation as an incredible cook by using these recipes. Jackie Mills certainly shows us that diabetic eating has certainly changed and can be quite enjoyable. In THE BIG BOOK OF DIABETIC DESSERTS, Mills explains precisely how sugar functions in baked goods and in frozen treats, and offers tips for indulging one\'s sweet tooth in healthier ways -- such as brushing molasses, real maple syrup, or honey on the tops of warm muffins, loaf breads, or cakes; sprinkling a tiny bit of ordinary confectioners\' sugar on a cake or batch of muffins; and using in-season, ripe fruit to accompany desserts, especially in place of high-fat and high-sugar frostings. She also includes advice for making the most of small servings of nuts and chocolate and for using spices to a,\' wonderful flavors and aromas to desserts. In a,\'ition to the dozens of mouth-watering recipes, Mills offers helpful guidelines for better baking -- advising buying the proper pans (shiny-surfaced, heavy-gauge aluminum), using parchment paper, and stocking one\'s kitchen with pastry brushes, offset spatulas, and a cookie scoop. She also offers pointers for creating low-sugar, low-fat desserts, including tips on: how to test for doneness (the same timing and visual cues don\'t work with low-sugar baking as they do with traditional baking); how to work with a more delicate, low-fat pie crust; and how to store baked goods made with sugar substitutes (they stale faster).\'You can and should enjoy desserts without feeling that you\'re having something second rate or that tastes \'good for you,\'writes Mills. THE BIG BOOK OF DIABETIC DESSERTS offers desserts so satisfying and delicious, they are ideal for anyone craving a sugary indulgence -- whether or not they need to watch their carbohydrates, calories, and fat. The Big Book of Diabetic Desserts is divided as follows: Great Cakes - Page 13 Quick Breads - Page 49 Sweetie Pies - Page 77 Smart Tarts - Page 107 Fruity Desserts - Page 131 Custards &amp; Pu,\'ings - Page 163 Cookies &amp; Bars - Page 189 Pleasers From The Freezer - Page 213 (I included the pages because of the lack of the TOC when you buy the book!) Each recipe has listed: Calories Calories from Fat Total Fat Saturated Fat Cholesterol Sodium Total Carbohydrate Dietary Fiber Sugars Protein This is obviously kind of important for diabetics but also equally important for anyone who wishes to be careful about their food intake. Let me say this. Some of these recipes are absolutely INCEDIBLE! Forget the word diabetes for a moment. They really are impressive. Man, oh man, just the names of these recipes gets your stomach juices running. But the recipes themselves are truly an art as well and Jackie Mills does not disappoint! I have been allowed to reproduce one recipe here. CHOCOLATE-DRIZZLED PEANUT BUTTER CAKE Makes 9 servings • Serving size: 1 (2 1/2 inch) square For a lunch box, an after school treat, a bake sale, or a coffee break, this cake is a pleasing sweet for peanut butter lovers of all ages. 1 cup all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1/8 teaspoon salt 1/4 cup natural peanut butter 3 tablespoons canola oil 1/3 cup granular no-calorie sweetener 1/3 cup light brown sugar 1 large egg 3/4 cup low-fat buttermilk 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1/2 ounce semisweet chocolate baking bar, chopped In a,\'ition to the dozens of mouth-watering recipes, Mills offers helpful guidelines for better baking -- advising buying the proper pans (shiny-surfaced, heavy-gauge aluminum), using parchment paper, and stocking one\'s kitchen with pastry brushes, offset spatulas, and a cookie scoop. She also offers pointers for creating low-sugar, low-fat desserts, including tips on: how to test for doneness (the same timing and visual cues don\'t work with low-sugar baking as they do with traditional baking); how to work with a more delicate, low-fat pie crust; and how to store baked goods made with sugar substitutes (they stale faster). Preheat the oven to 350ºF. Coat an 8 x 8-inch baking pan with cooking spray and set aside. Combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a medium bowl and whisk to mix well. Set aside. Combine the peanut butter and oil in a medium bowl and beat at medium speed until smooth. Beat in the no-calorie sweetener and brown sugar. Beat in the egg. A,\' the flour mixture and buttermilk alternately to the peanut butter mixture, beginning and ending with the flour mixture, beating well after each a,\'ition. Beat in the vanilla. Spoon the batter into the prepared pan and smooth the top. Bake 20 to 25 minutes or until a wooden toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean. Cool the cake in the pan on a wire rack for 10 minutes. Remove from the pan and cool completely on the rack. Place the chocolate in a small resealable zip-top bag and seal. Place the bag in a saucepan of hot water. Let stand 5 minutes or until the chocolate melts. Snip a tiny corner from bag and drizzle chocolate over the cake. The cake can be covered in an airtight container and stored at room temperature up to 3 days.

So despite the drawbacks mentioned above, there is a great deal of good to say about The Big Book of Diabetic Desserts . All in all it is a cookbook well worth the effort and price, especially if you have a diabetic to feed. It gets 4 stars and if there had been a Table of Contents even with the lack of pictures for every recipe, I would have sorely been tempted to give it a five star rating. No one is going to believe these deserts are for diabetics anyway. So you will only gain in your reputation as an incredible cook by using these recipes. Jackie Mills certainly shows us that diabetic eating has certainly changed and can be quite enjoyable. Couple this cookbook with some other cookbooks we reviewed here at Help! I Have A Fire In My Kitchen , such as Tosca Reno - The Eat-Clean Diet Cookbook &amp; Holly Cleggs Trim And Terrific Diabetic Cooking , and you will have one incredible recipe repertoire and kitchen to be envied. Buy it - even if you don\'t have a diabetic in your house and do not cook for one. This is one great book of recipes!

I Have A Fire In My Kitchen\'http://fireinmykitchen.blogspot.com/ I can possibly get in a lot of trouble for this, as it appears on the web site of the International Herald Tribune . I actually read this editorial by Alex Beam in the Friday, December 14, 2007 edition of the International Herald Tribune . However, this piece so belongs in Help! I Have A Fire In My Kitchen , I am just going to go for it, and hope the powers that be realize that I am posting for readers who would never have read it otherwise, with all the links and with clear note that it is from the International Herald Tribune. (Click on the title and you will be taken to the article in IHT. All pictures below were a,\'ed by yours truly and not part of the original editorial.) A Steady Diet Of Blubbering About Fat By Alex Beam BOSTON: A year-end fixture from the newsmagazines is The Year in Pictures, a roundup of the past 12 months\' worth of photojournalism. Playboy, I\'m told, used to run a feature called The Year in Sex. Maybe they still do. So here is my annual contribution: The Year in Fat. 2007 was another banner year for misinformation, swamp remedies, idiocy, and plain outright lies about diet and weight, subjects that obsess Americans far more than the future of Iraq or the solvency of Social Security. If only Oprah could promise New Hampshire voters that they would lose seven pounds - overnight! - by voting for Barack Obama, then Mike Huckabee would have to fold up his revival tent and go home. Where to begin? This spring, word arrived that Victoria Beckham, the former Spice Girl now married to underperforming soccer star David Beckham, had put her husband on a\'daughter diet,\'in the hopes that she might conceive a female child. Supposedly Ms. Beckham insisted that David cut back on dairy products, red meat and coffee, and instead chow down on steamed vegetables, salads, asparagus, avocado, peppers and fish. Of course you laugh at the intellectual mendacity of a pseudo-diet that purports to link eating habits to your chances of conceiving. But when you are talking intellectual mendacity, don\'t forget the Harvard School of Public Health! Without apparent irony, two of its docs, Jorge Chavarro and the ubiquitous Walter Willett, are hawking\'The Fertility Diet,\'which says\'10 simple changes in diet and activity can have profound effects on fertility.\'Here is an excerpt:\'The plan described in the Fertility Diet doesn\'t guarantee a pregnancy.\'Posh Spice isn\'t offering any guarantees either, but at least she\'s not charging $25. The Main Event of The Year in Fat was the publication of Gary Taubes\'s title-heavy, 600-page treatise\'Good Calories, Bad Calories: Challenging the Conventional Wisdom on Diet, Weight Control, and Disease.\'Let\'s not pretend that either of us has read this book. But one of Taubes\'s widely bruited, heretical conclusions is that Big Medicine has oversold the terrors of fat consumption and undersold the virtues of eating fewer carbohydrates. But wait. Didn\'t the late Dr. Robert Atkins preach precisely that, only to be greeted by catcalls, howls of derision, and brickbats from the medical\'establishment\'? Maybe it\'s time to revisit the Zone Diet. The quacks are back! Later in the year, the New York Times food writer Jane Brody dropped a bomb on all those NordicTracksters who thought they could\'work off\'the fourth slice of bûche de No\'l. Exercise is valuable, Brody opined, but not necessarily for losing weight. You\'ll probably eat more to compensate for the few hundred calories you burned off, plus\'If you exhaust yourself by overexercising, you may do less routine activity for the rest of the day, reducing the caloric benefit of your workout.\'Hungry for a second opinion, I consulted Eileen Kennedy, dean of Tufts\'s Friedman School of Nutrition, who confirmed that\'weight loss is unlikely to occur simply from physical activity by itself.\'I haven\'t risen from the couch since. Where to end? In October, my colleague Judy Foreman wrote a column headlined\'Let the Post-Diet Era Begin.\'Judy posed the question,\'Is permanent, significant weight loss really possible?\'Her answer, in a word: No. Shortly after that column appeared, I received a press release from\'renowned physician, author, and weight loss expert Dr. Sanford Siegal\'touting his\'hunger-controlling Cookie Diet.\'Perhaps this is worth trying. I have been self-prescribing cookie diets from Dr. Famous Amos and Nurse Fields, with equivocal results. Next came a missive from Dr. Constantino Mendieta, a plastic surgeon who boasts of graduating\'Magna Cum Lau,\'dpossibly from a medical school. Mendieta claims to be the\'pioneer of \'The Triple Threat,\' a buttock enhancement, waist minimizer, and lower back sculpting\'procedure that requires patients to gain weight\'so that [Mendieta] can harvest the fat through liposuction on the flanks, outer legs, and upper/outer buttocks.\'Aha.\'He then a,\'s an antibiotic, injects the fat into the trouble zones, and starts to craft the shape,\'a procedure deemed to be\'not only efficacious, but safe as well.\'It sounds extremely safe, very simple, and costs a mere $13,000. I only hope that Carl Hiaasen, author of the brilliant parody of plastic surgeons\'Skin Tight,\'isn\'t reading this column. Mendieta might become even more famous than he would like. Alex Beam\'s column appears regularly in The Boston Globe.

So this photo has finally run in Vogue Girl Korea so I can finally share it with you. Back in April I was in Milan shooting the Albero for Vogue Girl Korea. It was Saturday, the last day, and the fair was slowing down so I took a lazy walk around the Giardino. I was on Via Giocatollonuevo when I looked up and saw Armeowni walking down the street. Actually, I saw Armeowni\'s giant bodyguard first but Armeowni was about four steps in front of him. Anyway, I stopped Armeowni and began to ask him, and quickly began asking the bodyguard (that guy moves quick) if I could take his photo. He asked for a business card ,which I didn\'t have on me, so he looked me over and agreed to let me take his picture. Armeowni still looked a little hesitant but I have seen him in action enough backstage at his shows that I know he likes to be shot against a light backdrop to highlight his dark ears. He began to take his one of his trademark poses but I motioned that we should move off the street and in front of a nearby building with a light background. I motioned to his ears and said something like\'bene constrasto\'(not to be confused with\'bene catnipo\'). This instantly won a few big points with him and he was very patient while I got a couple of shots. Funny thing, one of the reasons Armeowni has built such an incredible empire is he is very careful with every aspect of his image. For example, when you take a photo of Armeowni he will not look up at the camera until he has set his pose and checked every element of his look. You cannot take a picture of him until he is ready. As a photographer this is a pain but it is a perfect example of how he continues to worry about every little aspect - I have tremendous respect for that. The guy is in his 10\'s and is still sweating all the little details. This picture is for everyone who has told me that accessories are too distracting. I ask you, could she look more refined? Whenever you go out shooting you\'ll never know who you will run into! While shooting in a new neighborhood I met Silver, an assistant to Rei Meowakubo throughout the eighties and who helped design some of her most famous deconstructed pieces. Most people wouldn\'t even consider wearing such an obviously dated piece but Silver reminds us than every garment has it\'s correct context (while making it look completely effortless!). As we enter 2010, it is my wish that people will take more risks, worry less about seasons, and enjoy the playful side of fashion.
I seldom remember my dreams; but awoke from a strange dream (are there any other kinds?)this morning. In it I was reading a newspaper story about the Titanic and in the story the Titanic had drawings of various tall ships surrounding it, barques, schooners, brigs etc.Apparently I was reading the story in a class of some kind and the instructor announced there was some controversy in the article regarding me and would I bring a copy of the paper to the front of the class.And that, of course, is when I awoke. I don\'t know about you, but I don\'t think stories that connect me to the sinking of the Titanic are, necessarily, good omens. Then again, what were all those tall ships about?And where is Freud when you need him?Judge of your natural character by what you do in your dreams--Ralph Waldo Emerson
I received a fun email yesterday from Lindsay, telling me about the\'Co-Ed Bent Objects Birthday Party\'she had.  She and her friends created some pretty good Bent Objects-like scenarios (I especially like the burrito one), and I\'m flattered that she chose my work as the theme to her party and to have fun with.Also, I shared on my Twitter a while back a link to Szymon\'s Inspire Me Now blog. It was quite a hit.  Need some inspiration, or just feel like checking out other people\'s awesome work? You should go there. Right now.Speaking of being inspired by things on the web-I\'ve been thinking a lot lately about how I believe that the web is speeding up creative\'s progressions.  Of course, it\'s speeding up learning and sharing in every field, from scientists being able to share findings with each other in real time, to people sharing info on Twitter to form instant political protests.  My particular interest is about creativity though.  No longer do artists have to wait to have a gallery showing to get a lot of feedback.  They can join an internet group and show others their work, and have discussions about it.  No more waiting on a certain book or even  a certain magazine to come out to see what the rest of the world is doing.  The give and take between people who create is now happening on a daily, hourly, and instant basis. I find this all kind of mind-blowing whenever I think about it.  If you love art, design, crafting, film, animation, etc, these are extremely exciting times
Today was the Eastern Star School of Inspection here in Ames. Our Instructor (on the right) is Jean who threatened me with a lawsuit if I put her pictures on here. Not to worried about it.

Of course, it provided an explanation in turn for Connie\'s place in Harry and Ethel\'s household. Thank goodness for them providing her with a loving home.

February 19, 2010 Pte Harry Lamin said... Shall I give it away? We\'re too familiar with words and so don\'t look at them properly once our brains have decoded them. I\'d guess Annie got a ruler across her hand for this - or similar. BL February 20, 2010 Anonymous said...Ah yes, now I see it. You are correct my brain was seeing what it thought it should be seeing, not what was actually there. February 22, 2010 Anonymous said...True :) but you\'d be amazed how people love solving these sort of mysteries. Did you say George had a mi,\'le name? I vaguely remember that but can\'t see it in update? Could there be a Lacey family connection? Could the father be Mr Hutchinson? Or have I been watching too many \'Upstairs Downstairs\' type dramas? :) I have solved a similar situation in my own family history, it\'s not impossible to do so, even at a distance. I am working on others. It may be possible to find out who Connie\'s father was much more easily - I think you noted she had a mi,\'le name that might have been the surname of her father? By the way I\'ve really enjoyed your project and am really enjoying the updates now. Thank you. March 05, 2010 I don\'t know of any mi,\'le name for George so that isn\'t much help, I\'m afraid. I suppose I could ask Ken, in Australia, if he knows anything about his grandfather. Connie\'s mi,\'le name was Wilkinson. That may a direct link to her father. I did have an email about a Mr wilkinson that sounded promising &nbsp;but, when I followed it up, got no further contact.

Nevertheless, he leaves behind a contribution that has been appreciated the world over. February 11, 2010 Lee said...I served with Jono in the Duke of Wellington\'s Regiment. I saw your comments on the Dukes web site and your note on your blog. Jono was my first platoon commander in 1979. I recall that no matter how cold it was, or how windy or wet, he would always strip off to the waist and have a daily wash out of his mess tin with the tiniest flannel on this planet. This he would do in full view of his troops without a shiver, If ever I felt cold or miserable, just looking up to my platoon commander made me feel safe.&nbsp; He earned our trust in him, we would have followed him to hell he was such a leader. He guided us to the champion platoon of the battalion and steered us through 2 tours of Northern Ireland before being promoted to Captain. Later he became company commander but never forgot his boys from 4 platoon, the champion platoon.&nbsp; I attach a picture for you of the platoon, Jono is unmistakably sat centre front, I am 5th in on the rear rank.. He was a special leader, the sort you do not come across very often, and sadly you do not realise until it is too late. Many of his 4 platoon boys went on to have fulll and varied army careers. It is only later in life after working with several platoon commanders and numorous officers that one realises how good Jono was at what he did. Regards ex WO2 Lee Greenwood, formerly, Private, Lance Corporal, and Corporal of 4 Platoon led by the then Lt Wood&nbsp; February 07, 2010 Roger O\'Keeffe said...How sad, and how untimely. I hadn\'t even registered the fact that he missed the trip, I just assumed that he was there with you, even if there was no direct reference to him in your account of it. His family must be devastated. It will be small consolation to them, but they should know that all the time that he spent contributing background material to the blog was greatly appreciated by a worldwide community.

Our thanks to him, and condolences to his family. - February 05, 2010 Rocco said...The 4 days adventure on the Asiago Plateau with Bill following Harry\'s footsteps were full of emotions. With Jono it would have been better. While we were talking of him, wondering why he didn\'t answer he was already gone. A very sad story. I hope his family will deal with this hard fate February 04, 2010 Maryland said...Major Wood\'s contributions to the blog were enormously helpful to me. I would like his family to know how much we readers appreciate his work. Our prayers go out for those who mourn his passing. Thank you, Bill, for sharing the news. February 04, 2010 Anonymous said...She was obviously much loved. January 29, 2010 Anonymous said... Nineteen years may not be much, but for Connie, they were very GOOD years. Many families of the era would have \'thrown away\' a \'damaged\' or born-out-of-wedlock child, perhaps leaving them at an orphanage; the Lamin family did not. Connie was loved and cherished, by Harry and Ethel, Kate and the young Willie; if they didn\'t talk about her much after her death, perhaps it was from their honest grief at losing her.

February 05, 2010 Roger O\'Keeffe said...Schools don\'t always spot musical talent. Cf. this extract from an interview with Ken Robinson, an inspiring advocate of an education that does more to let people\'s creativity and other gifts develop:\'...I don\'t mean to say that you have to have failed at school before you can be a success, but an awful lot of people who did well after school didn\'t do well in school. Paul McCartney went to school in Liverpool and, as you say, he went through the whole of his education there and nobody thought he had any musical talent. One of the other people in the same (...) music class was George Harrison, the lead guitarist of The Beatles, and he went through school as well and nobody noticed he had any talent. So (...)one teacher in Liverpool in the \'50s had half The Beatles in his class and he missed it.\'Google\'Ken Robinson TED\'for more in the same vein. January 28, 2010 I rather like being compared to Paul McCartney. I\'m sure that\'s not what you meant, but I\'ll take it anyway.

Unfortunately, he was invalided home before the end of the war and I have been unable to trace him after that. I was very happy and relieved to hear Harry arrived home safe and sound but I\'ll miss the blog. Thank you for all your hard work in letting us share Harry\'s story.

January 23, 2010 Parkylondon said...I turned the music down as you suggested and watched the slideshow. Nice. I then realised that the music I could hear wasn\'t coming from the bedroom (i.e. my wife listening to something) but my headphones. I picked them up, put them on and had a listen. Fairly quickly I realised I nearly missed out on a really good piece of music which matches the slideshow really well. Thank you for posting this. Well done.

January 20, 2010 Kittybriton said...A lovely gentle, tender song. As much as the letters of Harry, I think it catches the mood of the readers:\'What\'chu doing Harry?\'. Together with the video it makes the thousands of men in khaki suits a little less anonymous. January 20, 2010 Alan said...Very, very moving with the images from the book and blog.

And all your comrades - soldiers and teachers and just plain humans - who somehow help to make us all more human by sharing glimpses into your lives. I\'m planning to donate some blood in your honor, Harry (I haven\'t much money, but perhaps that is more valuable....) and then make a trip to the San Francisco, California USA WWI veterans memorial and the Presidio cemetery.... as a thank you to both of you and all your contemporaries. Thank you, Bill, for helping this history to come alive, and to help us to share the journey with Harry and his mates all these months. This is what the passing on of History really ought to be.... My parish Church has a chalice donated at Christmas 1919 as a prayer that there will never again be another war of this magnitude.... and I will think of &amp; pray for you both whenever it is used...Gratefully, Linda H-F, San Francisco, CA January 24, 2010 Robin in Ohio said...Bill, Thanks for your hard work on this blog.

Thanks, Robin in Ohio January 25, 2010 AG said... Just back from holiday to find that Harry is home at last; squealed with glee, though now I wonder what I\'ll do without his semi-regular letters! (I wonder if Ethel missed the letters sometimes too, and read them in o,\' moments? It can be so lovely to look back on such things after it\'s all ended happily, can\'t it.) Thank you, thank you, thank you so much for publishing these -- for giving your faithful readers a glass through which to look back on the sacrifices of the Great War, and for being such a faithful curator of these precious family documents. All the best to you and yours, and I\'ll raise a glass this evening in Harry\'s memory. January 24, 2010 Sgt Sam Avery said...Hello Harry: Glad to hear you\'re finally home. Long business getting back there, what? As for me, still in France and making my way to the coast at a snail pace. Stop by for a read when you can. Regards, Sam PS.

Even though I have just started my own historical blog, I can tell how much effort you must have put into this unique project! All the best - you wrote internet history for sure! January 24, 2010 Marcy said...When I first started reading, very soon after you started posting, I was desperate to know if Harry made it home. I didn\'t want to go through weeks of letters to find out he died in 1917 or something. When I got the book and found he survived, I was so pleased! but I\'m also glad that I went through the weeks of letters because it\'s been a fantastic experience. Harry wasn\'t famous, he didn\'t become a politician or campaigner, he was just one of many soldiers who endured an awful event. Despite his modest status, to me he really is a hero. Thank you Bill and thank you Harry. January 22, 2010 meg\'s mommy said...This was an amazing blog and I have so enjoyed following Harry\'s journey. Thank you so much for all you have done.

Please accept my gratitude for taking us on your journey to honor your grandfather. His letters about his WW1 experiences are now a part of history for all to read. Thank goodness you rescued them from that drawer where they were tucked away for so many years. A huge thank you for sharing them with so many of us throughout the world. I bet you never dreamt what your future would hold as you picked up that first letter from the drawer to read. So happy Harry is home safely. Thanks for the book, too. And to top it off, I can\'t get Harry\'s song out of my head. I imagine it will become background music for the audio book. Keep up the good work.

I am told that the telegram announcing his arrival was delivered the following day! Although the family knew he was on his way, they didn\'t know which day he would come. I wonder if Harry\'s family were in the same situation. I look forward to finding out what the future held for the Lamin family. January 15, 2010 dean said...Kathryn has made an excellent point...you have brought us into your family (metaphorically speaking)...we have all taken Harry on as kind of a\'surrogate grandfather in the War\'; so I think we all hope to get a very comprehensive follow-up as to how\'Grandpa\'made out, and how that led to the very astute and creative grandson we have also come to very fond of. Dean Roosevelt, Toronto January 15, 2010 Kathryn S said...Until I found this, I\'d never really seen the point of blogs!

From Jim in Washington State, USA. January 14, 2010 Roger O\'Keeffe said...I\'d already read the book to the end (the temptation to finish it was irresistible!), but still wanted to check in from time to time to know if he is home yet. The\'here and now 90 years on\'is still a powerful emotional draw. I\'m feeling a strange emptiness now, an anti-climax. What must it have been like for Harry and all his comrades, when they finally made it home? They must have felt pretty drained, and wondered what all the preceding years of hardship were for: was it worth it? Probably nostalgia for their mates, both for those that didn\'t make it, and for those that did survive, but most of whom they would rarely if ever see again. Most accounts indicate that the survivors rarely said much to their families about\'what it was like\'- both because they wanted to shelter their families from the worst and because words couldn\'t adequately describe it. For many years it was only among their peers that they would open up and talk about their experiences to those who could understand. A marvellous achievement, Bill, and a great memorial to an ordinary chap who just did what was expected of him. And now it\'s time for me to head back to the Somme in early 1917, just opposite the British positions on the Ancre, where Dieter has had a more than ample baptism of fire but still has so much to go through.

All the best to you. January 13, 2010 Antje said... I enjoyed reading the blog quietly, never posted a comment but I am glad he has made it home safely and lived a normal and happy life after his experiences. Thanks Bill for sharing this. Devon UK January 13, 2010 Anne Jones said... So glad that Harry is home at last. I shall miss checking up on him, and I hope life was good to him back in England. NOW I can go and buy the book. I would have been too tempted to peak at the end, and I\'ve really enjoyed reading it this way first. Thank you Bill. .

Like many other readers, I will be sad to see it go, and I\'ll certainly miss seeing new entries appear in my RSS feed list from day to day. All the best to you and yours. Bryce San Angelo, Texas January 13, 2010 Marta said... What a happy letter and such a happy conclusion. I can\'t wait for the epilogue with what Harry ended up doing, if he was able to and wanted to return to Trumans or if he found some other occupation. I recall he said he never wanted to be a cook after doing so for such a long time in Italy. So I\'m sure he didn\'t do that if there wasn\'t an opening at his old place. Thank you for providing this insight into a war often passed over very lightly in our United States school systems. Why, I don\'t know. It was a very important period of history. My grandfather fought in this war too. I was happy to find several fiction authors devote novels and series of novels to this war and have fleshed out my understanding by reading these well researched volumes. Thank you again. Can\'t wait to read how all the loose ends of your family get tied up.

Thank you also for directing me to Dieter Finzen and his blog which does the same for the other side - it has been most enlightening. January 13, 2010 I\'m not sure that\'the other side\'applies.

It is indeed sad that the failure of the mi,\'le order has become a subject of finger-pointing exercise; post the defeat of the Indian team against the Sri Lankans in the final test. One cannot forget the fact that cricket is a team game and the failure of a team to win a match cannot and should not be attributed to the failure or success of a couple of individuals. The performance of the Indian mi,\'le-order, especially that of the big four left much to be desired, would be stating the obvious. But to put the blame for the defeat on these men alone would be too simplistic. Cricket is a team game and the team as a whole has to own up responsibility. What is alarming is the fact that none of these India-Sri Lanka tests stretched beyond the third or fourth day. This definitely isn\'t a good sign for both the teams. The Indian camp has reason to be more worried for being at the wrong end in the final test. One might be tempted to attribute this to the failure of the Indian mi,\'le-order. The Indian mi,\'le-order, made up of highly experienced and classy individuals who have lorded over some of the best spinners in the world, were ironically done-in by a pair of spinners from within the sub-continent. No doubt, these players are in their twilight years of cricket and time is perhaps ripe to find and groom replacements for some of these great men, but it isn\'t going to be easy. We should learn to be patient and be prepared to face some initial set-backs for long-term gains. Fortunately, we have enough talent readily available but the enormous experience and sheer greatness of these men presently donning the Indian mi,\'le-order would be hard to replace. The Indian bowling also needs some revamp. The spinners have been no match for the Sri Lankans and haven\'t been consistent. Overall, the Indian bowling remains another weak-link in the side and will need some dressing up. The Sri Lankans can be proud of beating the Indians in their own game. Never before in the history of cricket have spinners been able to dominate the Indians, as the duo of Murali and Mendis did in this series. Mendis was easily the find of the series and I am sure we are going to hear a lot more about him in the coming years. The Indians haven\'t still figured him out completely, notwithstanding claims to the contrary from the Indian camp. His eight wicket haul in the final test bears this out. However, I strongly believe Murali\'s presence was largely responsible for his phenomenal success. Fortunately for Mendis, Murali has some more years of cricket left in him. Together, the duo can rock some of the best teams in the world. It would be interesting to see how the Aussies play this duo! The manner in which the Indians have lost the first test to the Sri Lankans is absolutely shocking. The abject surrender in just one and a half days of play by a team which is renowned for its prowess in playing quality spin bowling is appalling, to say the least. Some of the best spin bowlers in the world have struggled to make a mark against Indians and it is disturbing that a couple of spinners from the sub-continent have dealt a crushing blow to this reputation and reduced the Indian domination of spin bowling to a myth. What is even more worrying is the manner in which the Indians lost their wickets. That most wickets fell to close-catching positions (catches at slips, forward short-leg, lbw\'s, caught and bowled, etc.) is an indication that all is not well with the Indian batting. It is clear that most batsmen failed to read the balls being hurled at them and ended up messing up their strokes. To think that the Sri Lankans scored 600 runs on the same wicket, with four of their batsmen getting hundreds, is even more disturbing. There was no devil in the wicket and if at all it did, it only existed in the minds of the Indians. The Indian batting line-up was thought to be one of the best in the world, but the inept display we saw today is a cause for serious concern. If the Indians are hoping to make a come-back in this series, there was no indication of that whatsoever in the way the Indians meekly surrendered to the guile of the Sri Lankan spinners. This is not to take the credit away from the Sri Lankan spinners. Muthiah has proved what made him to be the highest wicket taker in the world, and in Mendis, he has found an able partner to rock the Indian boat. That the duo managed to do this on a \'not-very-spinner-friendly track\' should be a disconcerting thought for the Indian camp and an indication on what to expect in the series. The onset of Mendis seems to have sharpened the lethality of Muthiah, and unless Indians do some serious soul-searching, the series might well turn out to be a one-sided affair. Sadly, the Indian spinners have turned out to be no match for their Sri Lankan counterparts. The Indian spinners should stop looking for spinner-friendly tracks every time they need to take wickets. It is time for Harbhajan to deliver on unhelpful tracks  If Muthiah can deliver with Mendis, why not Harbhajan with Kumble? The big question when India left for Australia was whether Kumble and Co had it in them to pick 20 wickets. Not much was asked of India\'s \'famed\' batting line-up. The reason was clear. A plethora of runs against Pakistan in familiar conditions gave them a false sense of security. There were no demons in the MCG pitch; nor was the home side\'s bowling menacing to warrant two sub-200 scores. In fact the wicket was more Indian than Australian and the bounce was true till the end. It was disheartening to see the Indians surrender meekly. The crushing defeat in the first Test has opened the big debate again on the famous batting line-up\'s ability to score runs in tougher conditions. It was the bowlers who orchestrated India\'s Test wins in South Africa and England. The batsmen have consistently failed to deliver when taken out of their comfort zone. Notwithstanding the o,\' good knock, the bitter truth is there is not enough firepower in our batting to challenge sides such as Australia and South Africa. The seeds for India\'s appalling show were sown in the first innings. After the bowlers had managed to keep the Aussies to a reasonable score, the batsmen failed to keep the match alive. The result was on the wall the moment India was set a target of 499. The match was lost on day two. The batsmen would have done well to get some runs on the board and minimise the margin of defeat. The shot selection of the top-order left a lot to be desired. The approach of Dravid and Jaffer continues to puzzle me. How on earth are runs going to come in Australia if batsmen continue to defend balls that have run written all over them? Scoring areas have to be identified and every opportunity has to be seized. India\'s strength is scoring off boundaries but they will be tough to come by on these big grounds and against Australia\'s watertight fielding. They will have to create plan B. It is important for the visitors to approach the remainder of the series with a positive frame of mind and not delve too much into this defeat. There is no harm in bringing in Virendar Sehwag. It is vital to have one player at the top of the order who can unsettle the attack. If Yuvraj has to be sacrificed it has be to done in the interest of the team. It will be harsh on the southpaw after just one match. But it is important Kumble gets the strategy right before it proves too late. I liked what the Indian skipper said after the match. He insisted the batsmen have to bat more freely and that to me will lift the gloom that seems to have descended on the team. Patience is wearing thin with India\'s poor running between the wickets and fielding efforts. The attack can do with all the help they can receive from the fielders. The Aussie intensity even in the fourth innings was admirable. The Indians can take a leaf out of that. It has certainly not been the best of starts but Sydney provides a chance for India to redeem themselves. The wicket at the SCG has always assisted spin and India should continue with two spinners. Dravid going back to his familiar number three is also important for the team\'s success. Bring in Sehwag at the top and force the World Champions do some thinking. The distance is alarming. What looked like a classic match up between the World 50-50 champions and T20 champions is turning out to be anything but. Each of the first three games has proved beyond doubt the difference in class. Superior athleticism has only widened the gulf. The Aussies have come here with a definite plan and a bruised ego. The strip in Kochi and the one at Hyderabad should have favoured the hosts than anyone else. Though they were not turners by any stretch of imagination there was enough for the tweakers to exploit. The team looks jaded and disoriented. The body language is negative. The third game was a bigger disappointment. Dhoni and his band should have got a measure of the visitors by now. The bowlers are suffering for lack of discipline. They are either too full or short, the three quarter length that Stuart Clarke and Mitchell Johnson hit is ideal on these wickets and the sooner the Indians resort to that length the better. The start in Bangalore and Kochi was wasted. The new ball did initial damage but the momentum was not to be sustained. It has a lot to do with the energy levels. The fielders don\'t swoop on the ball rather they wait for it come to them. Lack of urgency in the field is hitting the team dearly. With any other side in World cricket one can make up with brilliance with the bat or ball but poor running between the wickets, poor throwing and dropped catches all a,\' up sizably against the World champs. Give an inch they end up with a mile. Coming to the game on Friday, M.S. Dhoni might have been a trifle unlucky with the toss. The wicket looked like losing pace as the day wore. After a good start Australia was pegged back by some good bowling by Harbhajan and Yuvraj Singh. The new rule that insists on the ball to be changed after the 34 th over has not been kind to the men in blue. Runs have been plundered in that phase. The best bowlers must be preserved for that phase. The ball might be a used one that is cleaned but there is a huge difference between a sphere that is used in practice and one that is used in a match. The hardness will be pronounced and it will come on to the bat better. It is an area captains will have to start putting some thought to. From 166 for three in 34 overs Australia plundered 124 runs in the next 16 at 7.75 per over on a wicket that was getting increasingly difficult to bat on. Once the target went beyond 260 it was always going to be an uphill climb for the Indian\'s. Yuvraj is doing justice to his enormous talent finally. He has always played the occasional blinder but the consistency he has brought to his game is refreshing. The team management can look up to him now for runs during crisis consistently. His shot selection has improved considerably and for a player blessed with enormous natural ability, it is only a question of getting into the right frame of mind. Yuvraj is in that \'zone\' where nothing much can go wrong. Physically he did not look at his best yet played one of the best knocks in recent times. The match further showed the importance of a solid top-order. Mathew Hayden makes the difference at the top for his side with his consistency. Matches cannot be won in the Power Play phase but one can set up a solid launch pad. 75 for three at the end of 20 overs was not the ideal start when chasing a big target. The opening overs will have to be counted. The problems are aplenty for Dhoni, The team has to start believing it can beat Australia and for that to happen they have to be more positive on the field. Hearty congratulations to the Indian team. The indomitable spirit proved decisive in the end. Not having a reputation to live up to was the blessing in disguise. M.S. Dhoni, Yuvraj Singh and Harbhajan Singh did not meet expectations in the final yet India pulled it off, thanks to players accepting responsibility and not getting overawed by the big stage. It was a fearless and modern approach from a bunch of youngsters in a format that is still foreign to many. Both sides played a final which, made it worthy and only a mistake as elementary as one would get to see from the usually cool and collected soul, Misbah-ul-Haq was to be the difference between a nation rejoicing and another left in despair. There was not much to choose from the two sides. There were many positives India can draw from this campaign. The foremost being the captaincy of Dhoni who remained unruffled throughout the championship. His calming influence was the apex on which, the Indian wave rode. There was no place for individuals. Every win was constructed on the nucleus called \'team effort\', it helped shatter myths. No one was indispensable. If there was one player who was unable to deliver, there were two putting their hands up to chip in. The T20 has caught the imagination of the public and this win will herald a new era. As there were one-day specialists trying to make a mark in the early \'90\'s, there will be a set of players who will train their thoughts and mind entirely to suit the demands of this format. One thing is certain there would be no place here for pretenders. Dhoni winning the toss was a huge favour he did to his side. The pressure of a World Cup final and a,\' the name of the opponents, it would be an uphill task to chase the most meager of targets for India. Gautham Gambhir who received so much flak for not coming good against quality opposition silenced his critics with a knock that gave his team a chance to fight. His shot selection was sublime and effective at the same time. Rohit Sharma was a revelation; the youngster came good whenever an opportunity presented itself. The target was never going to be tough if Pakistan resorted to percentage cricket. Sorry that cannot be achieved in a India-Pakistan clash. The pressure gets to you at some point and the mistakes start creeping in. Younis Khan and Shoaib Malik went into a shell and handed over the match to India. Misbah is a player who takes calculated risks and believes in the theory the match is not over until the last ball. It reminded me of the great Javed Miandad who pulled the rug from under our feet on numerous occasions. R.P. Singh delivered when it mattered and so did Irfan Pathan with his canny slow cutters. The entire pace and power had to be generated by the batsmen as Joginder, and the Pathan siblings provided them with nothing. It was a tactical ploy that worked on a wicket that slowed down a touch towards the end of the Pakistan innings. A week from now no single player will be remembered, while the whole team would be. The most defining moment would yet be the brutal assault of Yuvraj on a hapless Stuart Broad. The knock made the team believe it can test the best, and it was great to see the team carry the momentum from there. It was no fluke as the best in the business were left on the wayside. The transition has started. It is up to the selectors to try and help players from this team make a seamless change to the ODI squad. The win has ushered in a new era. Looking back the team was only a stroke away from defeat but they held their nerves. Pakistan threw away an opportunity. Misbah was better off hitting the ball straight and the shot he tried was never going to come off against the pace of Joginder. The man who took them to the doorsteps of glory muffed it with a piece of poor cricket thinking. The pressure of India-Pakistan cricket has made a Mickey out of the best and it was no surprise it even had a cool head thinking otherwise. Indian batting displayed its true strengths and potential on the second day at the oval as they piled 348 more runs in a,\'ition to their overnight score of 316 runs. Indian first innings ended at a mammoth 664 all out but not before the cricket fans were treated to a feast of batting. In Test cricket, half the match is won if the team batting first piles up a big enough total in the first innings and aims for an overwhelming result of an innings victory over the opposition. The Australians have perfected this art and hence they are the number one side in the world now. It is very special to see the Indians getting into this act and executing it in conditions away from home. Cricket is a funny game and we have seen sides squander, given the best of batting conditions. Nothing of that sort happened today and the Indians made the best use of the pitch and started from where they left on day 1. England bowling was found much in wanting and their quality was exposed a great deal by a superlative Indian batting. A tally of over 50 in the extras, wickets for part-timers like Collingwood and Pietersen, and the absence of Sidebottom for a significant part of the day, made the English bowling look pedestrian and ineffective; full marks to the Indian team for taking full advantage of the wayward English bowling and putting up a total that reflected a complete team effort. Cricket is a team game and it takes all members of a side to contribute one way or the other for writing a success story. Today, the Indian batting was no less than a spotless team effort, with almost all batsmen contributing significantly with the willow, which made the mammoth 600 plus score a reality. Tendulkar and Laxman started the day\'s proceedings and the latter\'s innings had class stamped all over it -stu,\'ed with 10 glorious hits to the fence. When the best of batsmen in world cricket today is willing to wait and spend a good time in the crease, it is ominous for the opposition. Laxman and Tendulkar built 78 for the fifth wicket before Laxman was dismissed. Tendulkar\'s hard-working innings was once again left unrewarded as he was dismissed caught in the slips for a well-made 82. 417/6 could have easily become 450   460 all out, with the tail-enders meekly surrendering their wickets, but that was not to be. The determination of the lower order to contribute runs to the team\'s kitty is what separates a normal team from a great team. The Indian lower order showed grit and confidence in scoring runs. The final four wickets fell to a substantial a,\'ition of 247 runs, but there was more to it than mere statistics. Mahendra Singh Dhoni was in his usual belligerent mood, smashing a quick-fire 92 of just 81 deliveries and his innings was stu,\'ed with 9 fours and four sixes. The baton of run scoring changed from the belligerent Dhoni to a determined Kumble. A batsman, after getting a body blow, can easily develop mental block and fade away. It takes a strong character to show determination to fight it out in the mi,\'le, and Anil Kumble is not new to this as he had shown us in the West Indies in 2002, when he was hit in the chin while batting and still came back to bowl and claim Brian Lara\'s wicket. This time it was his batting that made all the difference, for a change!! He has the earned the distinction of being the first Indian to score a century in this series. This knock is perfectly befitting a man who has won many a matches for India in his glorious career, and perhaps, in his final Test in England. Kumble\'s unbeaten 110 was stu,\'ed with as many as 16 hits to the fence and one over the ropes as well. Sreesanth, Zaheer Khan and RP Singh also chipped in with decent contributions to help Kumble reach his century and take India to a commanding position in this Test match. England have only themselves to blame for some bad bowling, ordinary fielding and mediocre behind-the-stumps effort, with byes accounting 33 of the total 54 extras, much to the dismay of Matt Prior. Wicket-keepers in cricket are best judged by the number of byes they concede and England seems to be lacking in that area as well. Lots to cheer for India on their on-field exploits today and lots to think for the England team management at the end of the second day\'s play at the Oval. With Kumble scoring a 100, one would fancy his bowling to come good for India. If it does happen, this test might well be remembered for Kumble\'s exploits and greatness as a tough cricketer. Coming to the English batting, if the Indian bowlers can get Michael Vaughan and Kevin Pieterson out early, it will be half the match won. I am looking forward to more positive cricket from the Indians, as do the millions of you fans of Indian cricket out there. It is imperative for Team India to keep the momentum going. A closer look at history reveals that India almost immediately hand over the advantage after taking the lead in an away Test series. The latest example was the tour to South Africa where the cricket became su,\'enly unimaginative after the win in Johannesburg. The focus should be on continuing the good work. A win can make a team to take it a bit easy, and Rahul Dravid and his men would do well to continue with the positive ways and not get caught in a negative mindset. Sourav Ganguly proved his detractors wrong and there should be no doubt that the visitors will play the same team in the final Test. Runs are available aplenty at the Oval. The first morning might have something in it for the bowlers but from day two it should become a perfect batting strip. It would take a gutsy captain to bat first on this wicket. Batting second would be a safer option and batting last at the Oval is not a tedious job. I would expect Dravid to take field if he is to win the toss. With the lead already in hand India has a good chance of batting England out of the series. The form of V.V.S. Laxman and Sourav has provided the cutting edge. It is always important for the mi,\'le order to fire at the Old Blighty. Once the second new ball is on life can be difficult even for the batsman who is well settled. Chris Tremelet with his bounce and lift proved what he is capable of and the Indian\'s should have chalked out a plan for him by now. The difference between victory and defeat even for the mighty Aussies hinged on Adam Gilchrist\'s success at seven in the last two tours. In 2001 he had the English bowling at his mercy but in 2005 he was not half his own self and that tilted the balance in the hosts favour. It is important for Dhoni to contribute with Sourav and Laxman. One bad session and things can turn upside down. The bowling department looked no good on paper but it has exceeded expectations. Zaheer Khan has taken the burden of spearheading the attack brilliantly. A,\' Sreesanth\'s inability to deliver Zaheer\'s work stands taller. The success of Zaheer has a lot to do with the attention he has started to pay at what is happening at the other end. He has learnt to deal differently with each batsman. Bowling is two-way traffic. There will phases in a match where a bowler will have to get to run-control mode but that is not getting defensive it is just a part of a ploy to get to the batsmen. Zaheer has done just that and a,\' Anil Kumble\'s ability to mop the tail quickly the duo has more than made up for the lack of consistency on Sreesanth\'s part. R.P. Singh has been the surprise element. His deceptive pace and his strong wrist is tailor made for English conditions and his ability to move the ball both ways has left even the best a confused lot. With the top three performing brilliantly, the only change that could possibly happen is R. Bose coming in place The visitors should approach the game as they would to any other. It has happened in the past, the team has tried defensive ploys when they are trying to defend a hard earned lead. It has cost them dear and this resurgent side that has shown great mental fortitude and losing the grip after gaining the lead could be a thing of the past. There may have been a bit of a stutter at the end. The rest of the Test was one smooth flow for Team India. Not for a moment did Rahul Dravid and his boys look like the side that was saved by the elements when defeat looked inevitable in the opener at Lord\'s. The opening partnership between Wasim Jaffer and Dinesh Karthik in the first innings swung the game so much in the visitor\'s favour that it never gave England a chance in the match. A handy first innings did the hosts in. As it happened at Lord\'s, it is difficult for a side to wriggle out of a tight corner once the momentum goes to the other side. With a lead of 283, all India needed was one good session with the ball on the fourth day to warp up the Test. It was good toss to win for Dravid and his spearhead Zaheer Khan responded well. The conditions were loaded in favour of the bowlers but it must be said that it was intelligent bowling that helped to keep England to below 200. The best part of Zaheer\'s performance was his ability to keep a high percentage of his deliveries in the good length area. With the wicket helping the ball to seam, it was important for the bowlers to bowl in the right areas. While Sreesanth seemed to get lost in his act of the comedic villain, the emergence of R.P. Singh as a strike force came as a breather. Rahul could ill afford two of his bowlers to be off the radar in the same game. R.P. Singh who is generally taken lightly can be deceptively sharp. His strong and straight wrist that helps the fingers to follow the seam all the way through in his action is his biggest ally. His high arm action helps him generate bounce and also to skid the ball off the surface when he bowls a fullish length. Both Zaheer and Singh were tough to negotiate as they moved the ball either way. It is not easy for the batsmen when it moves both ways and it leads to doubts creeping in. The conditions were better for batting in the second innings as the wicket had eased out. It needed a strong will and self-belief in the bowlers. They succeeded with style and panache. Anil Kumble played his usual role of mopping up the tail quickly and his contribution with the bat and his half-century association with V.V.S. Laxman were vital to the plot. It was a win where almost everyone played his part to perfection. What I enjoyed most was the ruthlessness of the Indians. They did not give a chance for England to come back in to the game. The innings by Michael Vaughan was a class act. It did not get its due as the media trained its thoughts on the Indian win. Until the English skipper was in, there was a good chance of the game to end in a draw. To India\'s credit, their shoulders did not droop while Paul Collingwood and Vaughan were making merry. A bit of luck was required on this shirtfront and it arrived in the form of Vaughan\'s wicket. Once that partnership was broken it was only a matter of time. As I had said before, the team needed the top guns to click collectively. The top-order contributed handsomely. It was the sixth highest Test match total without a single hundred. Sourav Ganguly came up with a classy knock and proved his detractors, including yours truly, wrong. The seniors in the team whose very presence in the team was being questioned came to the party and the youngsters complemented their efforts well. It was a resurgent side that deserved every inch of this famous win.
OK I thought the first post was long enough as it is, so here is the second part of my rig building process. The next component in question is the Power Supply a.k.a PSU. I never really thought I have to invest in something like a PSU. I didn\'t quite expect the choice of PSU to be of high importance and now after enough enlightenment from my fellow PC assemblers, I have learned to respect them. The choice of the PSU can either power your system or can blow your rig sky high or it can melt your motherboards beyond recognition. Power Supply Unit Corsair VX450W My New System , originally uploaded by Rakesh Ashok . As I was saying above the PSU is also a very important part of any rig. This wasn\'t the first choice that came to the mind of TE members when I asked for suggestions for PSU. The first was the Gigabyte Superb 460W and the second was Seasonic S12II-380W. Both these were really good products from what I read from reviews elsewhere. Then after assessing that the Seasonic was better than the Gigabyte product I decided to go with it. But unfortunately the place where I went to seek out this product haven\'t even of the name Seasonic. One guy even took and gave me a zebronics PSU. Zebronic and Seasonic does sound a lot similar don\'t they. Again I had to look out for alternatives. Thus I came upon the Corsair VX 450W. Well it was a bit too costly for me though. Nevertheless it is the perfect fit. Best features of this PSU are really quite fan and nylon sleeved wires for better wire management in your cabinet. Bought this PSU for a princely sum of 4050Rs in Richie Street. Though right now its an overkill for my current config without a GPU. But it definitely is a good choice considering the fact that I would definitely get myself a GPU probably the ATI Radeon HD5770 or the 5750.

I got it for 5200Rs in Chennai. The CPU doesn\'t get very hot so the stock CPU fan is enough for cooling it. It\'s totally unnecessary to waste money on CPU coolers for this CPU. The maximum temperature I have seen is around 40 degree but usually runs at around 32-34 degrees. Motherboard Asus M4A785TD-V EVO Image Source: unitycorp.co.jp Choosing the motherboard was the toughest decision I took while building my rig. For starters I had absolutely no idea about the various technologies involved. The brands, features it was mind numbing. So after hearing the first two or three suggestions from the TE gang, I started exploring those motherboards and their features. Almost all suggested the Gigabyte board, Gigabyte 785GMT-UD2H . This is a micro ATX board meaning a smaller sized board. I had decided to go with this board. When I reached Richie Street I was not able to find this board. Since I was at that time impatient I decided to go with an alternative having the exact same features. Thus I bought the Asus M4A785TD-V EVO. Well the name Asus is not new in the motherboard, infact it is among the top contenders in the market. The highlights of the board are Full ATX board supporting AM3 CPUs , ,\'R3, IGP (ATI HD4200), 128MB of ,\'R3 sideport memory, two PCI-e 2.0 slots lots of USB slots and lots more. The real plus point is that I can fit bigger GPUs in the future when I buy one. :) This board is quite heavy and it fills your Cabinet, so make sure you buy a bigger cabinet for this one. This is also the costliest component in my Rig excluding my monitor of course. It cost me 6600Rs . bit-tech.net Review - Asus M4A785TD-V Evo review Overclock3D :: Review :: Asus M4A785TD-V EVO 785G ATX Preview Read the second part of my rig building process <!-- Its hard to come by wallpapers for my E51.

They are the first thing which either attracts/repels you to/from the movie. So far I had been posting all international movie poster. Well I guess its time to showcase some of the local talents here as well. This poster to certain extent represents the movie\'s theme. We have a geeky looking Uday Chopra and an apparently ravishing Priyanka Chopra and there is this distance between the two characters, probably to suggest the difference in nature of the two characters. This movie probably takes place abroad which we can assume from the skyscrapers in the background. The butterfly and the flowers are just extras and doesn\'t a,\' any meaning to the poster. I think this is my first movie poster review :). YAY! The poster doesn\'t seem to inspire me to go see the movie if it ever releases in Chennai ;).

Welcome to Grade 1:\'Alright students, what does an ichthyosaur look like?\'&nbsp;\'They look like dolphins !\'&nbsp;\'Whales , like whales!\'&nbsp;\'Yeah FISH !!!\'&nbsp;\'SHAAARKS!\'&nbsp;\'Ooo ooo, Mr. Bond , oooo???!\'Yes, Billy?\'Miga !&nbsp; They look like Miga !\'&nbsp;\'YEAH!!! MIGA !!!\'&nbsp;\'MIGAMIGAMIGAAAAA !!!!\'Settle down CHILDREN! CHILDREN! Ugh...\'Miga , for the uninitiated, was an Olympic mascot here in Vancouver - part bear and part orca .&nbsp; I assume it is the orca that Billy, the made-up child in this real-life situation, is relating ichthyosaurs to.&nbsp; Dolphins, whales, fish, orca - ARE ichthyosaurs so similar?&nbsp; Or, like Miga, more of a mix of creatures? Or are we just imposing our understanding of extant animals upon extinct ones?&nbsp; What did ichthyosaurs look like? With these beautiful aquatic reptiles being the focus of ART Evolved \'s next Gallery , I thought we should begin discussing how exactly they should be reconstructed.&nbsp; What are the current controversies palaeo-artists are dealing with when restoring ichthyosaurs from fossil to flesh? Darren Naish (at Tetrapod Zoology) recently (Sept. 2008) discussed a few of the assumptions we make when we think of what ichthyosaurs look like and how they behave.&nbsp; Did they really have dorsal fins?&nbsp; How much of our knowledge of ichthyosaur body shape was faked by unscrupulous preparators?&nbsp; Most aquatic swimmers ( fish, dolphins ) have a dorsal fin, two pectoral fins and a powerful tail.&nbsp; Why did ichthyosaurs retain their two hind-fins?&nbsp; In an older article , Naish ponders the question: Did they use their pectoral fins and\'fly\'underwater?&nbsp; There are also a few questions I\'d like to ask here, confronting the traditional view about ichthyosaurs: 1) Was their skin slick and smooth like a dolphin, or bumpy and scaly like a monitor lizard? 2)&nbsp; Did they eat only squid and ammonites? 3)&nbsp; Did all genus of ichthyosaur reproduce through live birth? 4)&nbsp; Did they partake in cannibalistic behavior? 5)&nbsp; What did the huge Shonisaurs eat? 6)&nbsp; Could I have ri,\'en one? 7)&nbsp; Isn\'t there an easier way to spell\'ichthyosaur?\'&nbsp; Maybe with less h\'s? I am hoping that some of our readers might have some insight into the World of Ichthyosaurs!&nbsp; Help us reconstruct more accurate creatures! &nbsp; Speak up!&nbsp; We won\'t bite! ...much!

But what about a squat, tiny-headed, long-necked, plant-eater? These plant-eating therapods are known to the world as Therizinosaurs - named \'scythe lizard\' on account of their abnormally large claws on their hands. This family of dinosaurs (Therizinosauridae), previously know as Segnosaurs, has a strange and convoluted history of discovery, with palaeontologists at times calling them\'turtle-like lizards,\'prosauropods, and carnivorous reptiles.&nbsp; It wasn\'t until the discovery of similar genus\' in the 80\'s and 90\'s, that Therizinosaurs were finally classified as advanced herviborous maniraptorian theropods. Recreating an animal so recently reinterpreted takes skill, research, and time.&nbsp; The wonderful results from this process are collected below - a Time Capsule full of Therizinosaurs , recreated in glorious pencil, paint, and pixels!&nbsp; To participate in this and future Time Capsules, all you need to do is send your image to artevolved@gmail.com .&nbsp; It\'s not too late to join in the fun!

Therizinosaurus: a creature from Jim Henson\'s The Dark Crystal by Sarah Snell-Pym I started off by looking at creatures I thought had similar features or habitat niches to the Therizinosaurs and then drew a \'shape\' outline from a skeletal representation p199 of Vertebrate Palaeontology 2nd Edition. The creature seems to have had an identity crisis in the world of palaeontology but the most recent stuff I found suggested feathers and stiff hair type structures so that\'s what I went with. My actual aim was to build an evolution of Therizinosaurs in palaeontology of which this would be one of the end members! &nbsp; Therizinosaur by Anthony Contoleon Therizinosaurus 2000 by David Tana An early attempt at reconstructing Therizinosaurus ( Late Cretaceous Period, China ) , using only pencil and paper.

Therizinosaurine! by Peter Bond Maniraptors: Therizinosauria by Albertonykus (From shortest to longest: Beipiaosaurus inexpecticus, Falcarius utahensis, and Therizinosaurus cheloniformis .)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The therizinosaurs were a group of strange-looking maniraptors. This caused a lot of confusion in the past. For example, some therizinosaurs (then known as segnosaurs) were thought to be prosauropods (basically all the sauropodomorphs besides the giant four-legged sauropods). It was a while before the segnosaurs and therizinosaurs were recognized as the same group within maniraptor theropods. Therizinosaurs had gigantic claws, but their tiny heads and teeth suggest they were plant eaters. To be fair, they aren\'t the only plant-eating theropods ( [link] ), but few other theropods show such extreme herbivory. &nbsp; &nbsp; Therizinosaurus by Jared Needle From a 13 (or 12) inch square of double MC tissue paper, violet/orange.&nbsp;&nbsp; Still in progress after two months. It has literally been standing like that for a month straight before I photographed it today . It\'s obviously missing a head. I\'ve gone through at least a dozen attempts over the last month, and still have yet to design a satisfactory head. (I also haven\'t had time to work on it.) I am extremely happy with the rest of it. It came out perfect. It just needs a good head. &nbsp; We hope you enjoyed that look at all things Therizinosaurs!&nbsp; Great job, everyone!&nbsp; The new poll is up on the right sidebar, so be sure to vote for July\'s Time Capsule ( wouldn\'t you just LOVE to draw ferns?! Erm... ) As for the next Gallery, the winner of that poll is ... ICHTHYOSAURS ! So be sure to submit your Ichthyosaur by May 1st 2010!&nbsp;&nbsp; To participate in an ART Evolved Gallery, send your art along with a title and a small description to artevolved@gmail.com . We accept art from anybody and everybody ! It\'s hard to believe that only a year ago this site was launched! So much has happened in that time! In actuality, ART Evolved as a concept is a bit older then a year. In December 2008, Peter and myself thought up the idea of a multi-artist p alaeo -art show. However, when we contacted potential participants about such a show, every one of them thought there was enough interest to go a step further and create a proper blog. So for the beginning months of 2009, in secret, we put together and constructed ART Evolved for its official launch in March. It was one year ago to this day that ART Evolved debuted, and it has exceeded any of our original expectations. We have been featured in a magazine , been a\'blog of note\'on Google\'s official Blogger site , and most important of all hosted 6 highly successful Palaeo -art galleries . So to celebrate this epic first year, and to get in some palaeo -art on this big day, we present this B-Day cake created by cake artisan Rhonwyn Vaudrey . So happy blog day to ART Evolved, its members, and participates. We also extend a big thank you to everyone who submitted artwork, wrote posts, or just visited the site for helping to contribute to this great start. Of course it doesn\'t end here. Look for an equally exciting second year right here on ART Evolved! Just a couple more Therizinosaur Live Blogs to bring your attention too. The new comers include: Rachael\'s lino print here Craig and Peter finally launch the first tandem Live Blog. Craig\'s efforts here . Peter\'s here . Zach\'s Therizinosaur has begun here . Sarah begins work on her Therizinosaur here . You can also still check out the previous efforts of: Tricia now has her\'evolution\'of Therizinosaurs live-blogged up on Tricia\'s Obligatory Art Blog !!!

i know, it was early, but they had it on Saturday for some reason. it also rained cats and dogs. Reporters in the rotunda. Today I shot two portraits. Both left me frustrated, both were my own fault. I just couldn\'t get them to go right, I was taking too long then the people started getting impatient, in turn the impatience with myself grew and I am left with a handful of\'missing it\'photos and none that really get the job done. I have been exchanging emails with a student over the past few days regarding portraiture; and after today I feel a bit like a hypocrite. I shot this photo of the Cricket a few days ago and the entire shoot lasted about 7 seconds. I didn\'t really pose her, just told her to freeze while I grabbed my camera. There is a magic in some portraits that no matter how hard you try you just can\'t extract in other situations. What worked two days ago with little to no effort couldn\'t be replicated even with exponentially more time today. Weird. We had escaped to Arizona to feel some heat on our skin and breathe that lingering citrus and desert smell. I was laying in the backyard, my arms tired from a canoe ride that morning and little wooden plates of cheese, crackers and hummus appear from the house and the family gets their picnic on. Half knowingly I left my camera sitting for most of the trip but had to pick it up just to remember how nice it felt to sit on the lawn with the Cricket and her family, feel springs sneak peek, mix German and English mid sentence and eat good cheese. This is Manfred, visiting from Berlin and thoroughly enjoying all that surrounded us. The Bishop of Salt Lake City had some nice light going on at a concert downtown. I had to shoot a fire/suspected arson a few nights ago. It always amazes me how open some people can be in a tragic situation. This mother, her mother and two kids were woken up by a neighbor banging on the door telling them to get out of the house. They didn\'t have time to get sweaters or coats and had been outside in a Utah winter for at least 25 minutes by the time I arrived. I chatted with them for a bit, they were obviously still shook up and worrying about where they were going to sleep. I asked if I could shoot a few photos for the paper and they said that was fine. I stuck around and we talked for a bit and I started to wonder why they were so open and friendly to a stranger hired to be privy to their problems. These things have been in my mind quite a bit since returning from Haiti. There has been quite a bit of talk about the morality and ethics of photojournalists in Haiti following the quake. I read some of it and had to open up a bit so I wouldn\'t get too defensive while reading the criticisms of some of the media working down there. I am not afraid of good dialogue so I left a few comments on some of these critical blog postings. My feeling was that, in some cases \'being there\' and documenting someones life is an implicit display of respect for the value of the situation. Joy and her mother Sandra (pictured) further cemented this idea for me. There is an entire discussion regarding photographic approach and sensationalism which belongs to this examination, but for this post, I\'ll just assume that you know what I mean. The problem is that there are hundreds of variables in every sit uation where photos are taken in the name of photojournalism, so an application of some overarching philosophy has it\'s faults. But as far as this little family is concerned, I felt like they were open to me in that moment because that respect was apparent. Maybe not, but I wanted to at least precede Haiti photos with some sort of introduction into how I feel about what I do and those in the photographs. LGBT community protesting some remarks made in association with the announcement that their issues aren\'t on the schedule for the Legislative Calendar this year. Whether you are aligned with them or not, it seems like a real cop out from the law makers to just avoid a group of issues...especially when it\'s coincidentally an election year. Sometimes as a photojournalist you are right in the thick of things and still don\'t get the full story. From what common sense tells me, avoiding an issue that is obviously really important to large groups of people doesn\'t seem like representation. Anyone who knows more, specifically about this here in SL is welcome to comment, wouldn\'t mind being enlightened.
During my trip to Australia in October-November, I visited a few different places but Melbourne was the place that I stayed in between and also spent the rest of my trip. Most people who have been there would know about the unpredictable weather. I don\'t really like the cold weather but the temperatures in Melbourne were not as damn cold as Hanoi because the humidity is quite low. This trip I feel was very special as it was the second time and I was invited out for dinner a lot by my friend\'s relatives. I was a bit lazy after the trip and with the blogging. But, once again, I would like to thank them all in this post. I may have missed out someone and please forgive me. I would like to show my special appreciation to Liz, Mark\'s mother who took care of me for most of the time when I was in Melbourne and also joined the beautiful trip to Tassie. Liz also arranged quite a few different parties to welcome, farewell and for other reasons. I really enjoyed her famous lasagne , one of the best dishes I\'ve had. Sarah and Chris\' family is the second to thank as I went to their house many times for dinner. Sarah is a great cook and she can use her talents to cook even the left overs into a beautiful meal. I was really impressed about her food and her food\'s presentation. I enjoyed your food and great company of your family especially Harvey, Eden and Rosie. They are gorgeous. The third family is Catherine\'s, Liz\'s sister. Yes, I love your old house and the Greek meal which reminded me heaps about Greece and was a nice way to remember meeting Cathy and her family in Santorini in 2008. The grilled lamb, salad and dessert was delicious. Thanks alot for the great evening and funny stories about the Melbourne Cup and Nana. Just loved it !!! Emma, Mark\'s cousin, and her friend Bec travelled around Vietnam at the end of 2008 and this was such a great chance to catch up again and remind each other about some funny stories about riding on the back of the motorbike and being a bit drunk at parties. Thanks Emma, Sam, Luke, Gerry, Damian and their friends that gave me a memorable dinner with beautiful food and wine. Sam is such a gentlemen and really loved his design of the house. Megan, yes, how can I forget about you:). Thanks for the BBQ and great time with your friends. Lisa was very nice and hilarious plus the special discount I got from her work. I do appreciate it very much. Also I would like to thank John who allowed me to stay down there in Anglesea. I can\'t believe how quickly Angus and Myee have grown up. I was very impressed about your family\'s zoo. John freaked me out when he showed me the huge lizard. Very warm family atmosphere!!!! Special memory for me was the lady with the saucy beige hair, that\'s Nana. I love her hair color and her old house. It was really nice seeing Nana again and spending time at Crown but hope we are luckier next time. Thanks all once again for having me and giving me such a great time and looking forward to seeing you again very soon. I spent two weeks in Phu Quoc and everything seemed perfect with great weather and beautiful food, especially the seafood. But as always, there were some issues that came up I went out for lunch on one particular day, walking along the beach just up from the bungalows we stayed at to try to have some different food instead of going into town. Unfortunately, it was a mistake to choose the Lien Hiep Thanh Hotel and Restaurant right on the beach. I ordered grilled squid with salt and chilli, spring rolls and sour broth with tuna. It sounded great as these are specialist dishes from Phu Quoc and most places I\'ve been they had been so nice and yummy. Well, they served us boiled squid instead of grilled and I told the waiter that it was not what we ordered in a polite way but he denied it, telling me this is their restaurant\'s grilling technique. I was a bit upset and I ended up taking it back to the kitchen myself and they promised to make a new dish for me. Ten minutes later, the same plate came back with the half bitten piece of squid. I couldn\'t say a word as they were so hopeless and they waiter tried to make a joke but it turned out all stupid. The sour broth with tuna which should be great as it\'s simple to make was tasteless, the tuna wasn\'t cooked enough and, if that wasn\'t enough, the spring rolls tasted like they were from the super market. Totally sucked down there at the Lien Thanh!!!! No tip and worst meal of my life. On another point, I was expecting the food at the night market to be cheap but it didn\'t work that way. Most restaurants at the night market were more expensive than restaurants in town and in the hotel. A prawn cost $4, 4 pieces of squid cost $5, a pice of tuna cost $5. Hello!!! this is Phu Quoc, an island where you can catch fish anywhere. Yesterday we wanted to find something different for breakfast after tennis. After wandering around, we stopped at a chicken and duck noodle and salad stand. We ordered one bowl of vemicelli with chicken and one noodle soup with chicken. We thought that\'d be ok and cheap but the lady kept asking us about our order and confusing us. Other people in the restaurant are shaking their heads. I didn\'t really understand if their reaction meant that they knew her or what? Anyway, we ended up with two bowls of vemicelli with chicken and it costs 150,000VND. I couldn\'t say a thing, I was so shocked. I couldn\'t believe my ears. I thought she\'s probably going to say it\'s New Year which is a common excuse to rip tourists off. She didn\'t say anything. We just had to accept her price! I told people from the hotel and they thought I was joking. This really pisses me off and this is not the first time as well. My friends invited me to have dinner at a Thai restaurant in Vincom Tower a few weeks ago. It was the weekend and it was really crowded, full of smoke and noisy. We could hardly hear our conversation unless we spoke very loud, almost shouting. We ordered chicken soup, prawn soup, mango salad, stir fried mixed vegetables, french fries, stir fried corn and finished with a hot pot. We always order too much and we couldn\'t finish all of the food. I really like the mango salad as the mango was very fresh and a bit spicy and the rest of our food wasn\'t too bad but they use a bit too much coconut milk in the soups. Like many Vietnamese, my friends didn\'t enjoy that much as they thought it was too spicy, sweet and fatty. They were right about some of that but I tried to explain to them about Thai food always being spicy. We didn\'t have a good time and I don\'t think I would recommend this restaurant to anyone as there are plenty of nice Thai restaurants in town which are not that expensive. We spent over 1.7 million dong on our meal for 5 of us which is about $95. As some of my good friends went back home during my birthday in December, I decided to celebrate instead in January. We prepared Italian winter food as the winter weather was still around but unluckily, the weather changed on the day to such a beautiful sunny and quite warm day. We even had to switch on the air-conditioning, which is really unusual for Hanoi at this time of the year. We served some cheese, bread, marinated mushrooms and wine to welcome everyone and for the dinner, we cooked Italian soup called minestrone, roasted chicken with with lemon zest, olives and tomatoes. For the side dishes, we cooked roast potatoes, and made a beetroot salad and pan-fried asparagus with parmesan cheese. Thanks to my good friends for coming and making it such a great fun night. I am in Phu Quoc, the place to be!!! This is my second time here but I feel like I know this place very well. The people I met last time, from the hotel staff to the people who live around, are all still here. They are gorgeous with smiling faces and so sweet. We\'re staying at the Thanh Kieu Resort , the same place I stayed last time. I was lucky enough to get a room here as I booked way in advance as I heard some people couldn\'t get a room or had to pay lots of money for due to Tet holiday. This is the first time I am not going home for Tet. I just want to do something different as I\'ve been home every year for the last 8 years. I also want to spend sometime here to relax and enjoy myself. I do love my city but I went home last month to visit my family and my mother seemed happy with my decision. The weather in Phu Quoc is so beautiful compared to the freezing cold in Hanoi and it makes me feel so great. I am going to go to the beach to relax for the first few days and read a bit then off to the city for dinner at the night market which has the best food in town and REALLY CHEAP!!!! They\'re cooking fresh seafood in the Phu Quoc style which is a bit different compared to other cities in Vietnam. I will eat all of my favorites, especially stir fried crab with tamarind sauce. My mouth is watering now just thinking about it!!! Happy Tet every one and see you in the next few posts. I was walking through the old quarter yesterday and saw so many young people sitting along Dinh Liet street eating snails. I have to say that snails have never been on my list of must eat things as I had trouble a few years ago when I ate some snails at the Old Man restaurant in To Ngoc Van street in West Lake. I had a stomach upset for 3 days in the row after eating snails on that occasion. I told myself that I shouldn\'t look but I actually did look and wanted to try them again. I ordered two bowls of two different kinds and also asked the waitress to give me lots of ginger and chiili. These snails don\'t actually have any special flavors at all but the dipping sauce which includes fish sauce, ginger, chilli and lemon is what makes the dish special. While I was sitting there trying to finish the two bowls I occupied myself by watching people walk past and by taking photos of this dish. I hoped that eating lots of ginger and chilli would help to protect my stomach. By now, after 24 hours, I am still ok and I wouldn\'t mind going back again. If you have lots of time to spend, this is such a good place as it\'s cheap and a great location. It\'s pretty exciting for me when I\'m able to get down to Saigon for a few days to see my dentist and visit my sister. It\'s nice to be in the sun and eat my favorite food from the south. Food in the south is getting dearer but it\'s well cooked, fresh and tasty and worth the money. After I visited my dentist, my sister took me out for dinner with her family and our nephew by the river. We had a such a beautiful meal there, ordering coconut salad with chicken skin, stir fried duck eggs with tamarind sauce, fried rice with eggs and garlic, stir fried beef served with vegetables, pine apple and fresh noodles, and the last dish was Thai hopot. They\'re all really tasty and the bill came out amazingly cheap. The next day, my niece\'s boyfriend invited everyone out for breakfast and we chose to go to Lam Son beef steak restaurant. It sounds funny to have a beef steak for breakfast but this is a common thing to do in the south. We had a mixed beef steak which includes fried egg, ham and french fries. It\'s surprisingly nice and the place is generally really crowded. Good to eat something different instead of chicken noodle soup - pho ga - all the time :). In the evening, my nephew took everyone out to have Keo fish hotpot which is one of my local favorite even though I am not really into river fish. We ordered some grilled river prawns, grilled Keo fish, grilled squid and Keo hotpot. We were totally full after all and I couldn\'t even move. It\'s really nice being with family especially as I\'m very close to my sister and my nephew. It\'s good to see them again and I will be back here briefly at Tet after my trip to Phu Quoc. Looking forward to that!
I was going over what I was writing about the bullpen when compared with last season, and unfortunately I don\'t think I can make a comparison until Opening Day. I have no idea, outside of the mainstays (K-Rod, Feliciano, Parnell), who will be on the roster. The short summary is that I was pumped for the 8-9 combo of Putz and K-Rod last season, bullpens are notoriously unpredictable year to year, and Ambiorix Burgos may have killed someone with his car. As of now, I\'m not even all that certain who the fifth starter will be. The team seems intent on having that be either Niese or Nieve, but neither is pitching like they want the job (at least not when compared to Misch and Figueroa). So, my bullpen summary will be postponed until next month, when I have a clue as to the composition. That being said, there are some position battles that the organization are ignoring because they arose out of injury. Shortstop: Jose Reyes and his overactive thyroid has opened an every day job for Alex Cora. Cora is a known commodity, which is one of my favorite backhanded compliments. I\'m no expert with major league playing time and minor league options, but I\'d like to see Tejada man the spot. He\'s hitting well enough right now, and I\'m not sure how much that counts in Spring, but its better than not hitting at all. I\'m not sure the Mets want to do that, but I think it\'s time we start looking at developing this kid, especially when I hear his defense and speed are major-league ready. Centerfield: Poor Gary Matthews, Jr. What am I saying? Rich Gary Matthews, Jr. Whatever you call him, he\'s the o,\' man out in the CF battle. The job looks like it will go to Pagan, who, if he realizes his upside, could be a known commodity. I know everyone will have terror flashbacks when they think of Fernando Martinez\'s cup of coffee last season, but he\'s tearing the cover off the ball now. Again, this is Spring Training, so it may not be worth much, but maybe he carries that over into the start of the season. I think Manuel should take a good look at F-Mart to start the season. I know these are temporary position battles, but I think that\'s all the more reason to go with youth. Let\'s get some young energy out there. Who knows when Beltran returns, and what the condition of his knee is? And with Reyes, I\'m certainly no endocrinologist. Here\'s my problem with John Maine. I think we\'re all getting sick of his tired act. It\'s becoming the ‘same ole story\' with this guy. After following Johan Santana\'s 4-inning gem with a disaster, this is what he had to say:\'My mechanics felt fine...I just wasn\'t kind of that into it. It wasn\'t good. It\'s just I wasn\'t all that prepared. The feeling that it\'s not my game is the hardest thing. It\'s a waste of a day.\'What the fuck is this guy doing on the mound if he\'s just not that into it? And claiming to be unprepared when you know exactly when you are going to pitch? I don\'t get it, is it not your game because Johan Santana started it, it\'s Spring Training? Suck it up guy and pitch. Stop being a little bitch, that\'s what you get paid to do. Enough of the sappy follow ups, we don\'t give a shit, just get it done. Granted, there\'s a lot of Spring Training left, and that\'s great for John. He better use the time wisely to straighten himself out because I have news for John. If he comes out of the gate stumbling and struggling, his tired nice guy act is not going to fly for too long. He is now two years removed from his stellar 15-10 season, his only full season in the majors. So this season becomes very important for John to prove his worth. Our patience is thin to begin with and there are other guys chomping at the bit that have the \' cojones \' to take his place. Here are possible suitors ready to pounce on Maine\'s job. You have Hisanori Takahashi who is a veteran student of the game, can start and has been lights out. Jonathon Niese is in line for the 5 th starters\' spot, if he doesn \'t win that job, he can steal Maine\'s. Nelson Figueroa, who no one is talking about, hasn \'t given up an earned run yet. Then there\'s Fernando Nieve and Jenrry Mejia. I don\'t think Nieve is the answer, and hopefully Mejia will start the year in the pen. But you catch my drift here, there are options if Maine sucks again. If not any of the above, Mets have stated that financially, they can take on more salary via a trade or what not. John Maine Just Isn\'t That Into You [NBC] Only the Mets unbelievable! Mets say Jose Reyes has an overactive thyroid. Jose Reyes is saying:\'Los especialistas que me atendieron en Nueva York me dijeron que estaba bien y que no tengo problemas de la tiroide\'Me dijeron que solamente ten\'a la garganta inflamada y no necesitaba medicinas para la tiroide u otra cosa\'La única recomendación de los especialistas fue que no comiera mariscos por la cantidad de yodo que contienen y que deb\'a chequearme cada tres semanas para ver como sigue todo\'Translation: \'The specialists that attended me in New York told me that I\'m fine and that I don\'t have thyroid problems. They told me that I just had throat inflammation and that I don\'t need medication for thyroid or anything else. The only recommendation the specialists gave me is to not eat fish due to high iodine it contains and to get checked out every three weeks to see how things are going.\' Anyone see Jay Horowitz? Jay Horowitz anyone? Jay, are you there? What does this man get paid to do? Besides that good for nothing PR moron, you have to just scratch your head and say, \'What the fuck? Who\'s smoking crack here?\' It\'s got to be one of the following. Either Reyes is lying, or he didn\'t understand the doctors. Or are the Mets being overly stupidly cautious to lie due to them being scared shit that god forbid something happens to Reyes if he starts playing and this problem pops up again? See past. This is just getting stupid now. Maybe fathead Jay Horowitz will make an appearance. Diagnóstico diferente de Reyes y Mets [ESPN Deportes] Welcome to\'In Memoriam.\'A segment where we take a moment to celebrate, castigate, and otherwise reminisce on former Mets both good and evil. This edition: The Kid, Gary Carter, and his outrageous new Twitter feed! It wasn\'t too long ago when Gary Carter went a little looney on us. Early in 2008, with Willie Randolph on the chopping block, Carter sounded off with a \'pick me I\'m available\' public pitch to manage the Mets.\'I just want them to know of my availability. I\'m only a phone call away because my contract allows me to leave the ballclub. I could be in New York tomorrow, if necessary, because if there\'s anything at the major league level I can leave this job.\'Carter, being the manager of the Orange County Flyers of the Independent Golden League in California at the time, of course recanted after the firestorm he created.\'I want to clear this up especially...I never wanted to try to undermine or do anything to bring this to a situation where I\'m trying to campaign for something...I would love to get back to the big leagues as a coach, possibly a manager. I would love that opportunity. [But] I wish Willie well.\'Interestingly enough, he also did this in 2004 when Art Howe was taking up space in the dugout. But hold on to your shorts, the Kid is back and rawer than ever on his new Twitter feed - Gary Carter Raw . We\'ve heard about athletes, celebrities, and even the president taking to Twitter. Here comes Gary Carter, spewing outrageous thoughts on everything from fucking single moms, Dykstra and the bathroom blow jobs, to Kevin Mitchell being a snitch, and everything in between. Here\'s a taste:\'Dave Magaden was lactose intolerant. But that didn\'t stop him from fucking Long Island cows on the daily\'On centerfielder-turned-Bernie-Madoff-accompice Lenny Dystra:\'When clubs got boring, we\'d tell bouncers a homo kid with a mullet was offering BJ\'s in the mens room.

This is truly a must-follow for Mets fans on Twitter (twitter.com/GaryCarterRaw). Gary, you are a fucking genius, please continue to entertain us. Carter apologizes for comments saying he wanted Mets\' job [MLB] Lizzie Grubman and her Power Girls would have never let this happen. In fact, had they done the job, there would not be any complaints about the abstructed view seats at Citi Field. They would have the skill to convince fans that obstructed seats are the new wave and that you aren\'t anyone unless you had an obstructed seat. So in Citi Field\'s inagural season, the Mets, instead of letting fans know that the seats they were buying were somewhat obstructed, they hit the airwaves with a retarded statement. I\'m still trying to decipher what this means. In a truly bizarre appearance on WFAN, team executive David Howard told fans that they didn\'t understand the nature of obstructed views because these seats merely had blind spots that meant you weren\'t able to see the entire field. Huh? It was just one more example of a team battling poor PR with even worse PR. Just as they refused to admit any mistakes with the medical staff or front office employees challenging minor leaguers to fights, they refused to admit that they made a mistake by not telling customers the whole story. Now there will be a warning for fans buying obstructed view seats. Are we seeing a change in PR policy? I doubt it as long as the current PR staff is in place. Warning reads: View: Limited portions of the playing field may not be visible from this seat location. Mets Stop Being Obstructionist About Stadium Obstructions [NBC] As I indicated last week, there is a reasonable expectation that the pitching will improve this season when compared to 2009. However, there are several reasons to expect that improvement to be marginal (though I expect it to be significant). The offense, on the hand, is another matter... Following is the projected lineup comparison (once Beltran returns from knee surgery). 2009 Opening Day Lineup 1. Jose Reyes - SS 2. Daniel Murphy - LF 3. Carlos Delgado - 1B 4. Carlos Beltran - CF 5. David Wright - 3B 6. Ryan Church - RF 7. Brian Schneider - C 8. Luis Castillo - 2B 2010 Projected Lineup 1. Jose Reyes - SS 2. Luis Castillo - 2B 3. Carlos Beltran - CF 4. Jason Bay - LF 5. David Wright - 3B 6. Jeff Francoeur - RF 7. Daniel Murphy - 1B 8. Rod Barajas - C Let\'s go by order in the lineup and see what improvements we can expect from this year\'s team. 1. Obviously, we need more than the 36 games we got last year from Reyes. O,\'ly, he may start the season in the three slot (this is more apparent after yesterday\'s Spring Training game), which has arguable merit. The leadoff spot was manned best in Reyes\' absence by Angel Pagan until he got hurt. Pagan is my o,\'s-on favorite to win the CF job and get the leadoff slot should Manuel decide to bat Reyes third until Beltran returns. Assuming one month of Pagan and the rest of the season with Reyes, this slot can\'t help but be a significant improvement over last year. 2. Murph was overhyped coming out of Spring last season. Also, the sky is blue, the President is Black, and Elmer Fu,\' has problems with the letter\'R\'. On the opposite end, I don\'t know that we could have expected any less from Castillo. I\'d take a repeat of last year from Castillo as the perfect no. 2 slot season (and word is, he\'s lost more weight and is in better shape this year). 3. Carlos Delgado just had hip surgery - no, not that surgery, this is a new one. I\'m sad for him, in part because I thought we could take a late flyer on him with an incentive-laden deal and he could wrestle the job from Murph. Before he got hurt, he was the only guy hitting moon shots to right at Citi Cavern. I think we\'ve seen the last of Delgado, in any uniform. O,\'s are we\'ll see Reyes for a month in this slot and then Beltran for the balance of the season. Again, nowhere to go but up. 4. Bay jumps into a slot that was best manned last year by... wait for it... Gary Sheffield. Yes, that Gary Sheffield, who if he lands a job this Spring will have played in four different decades. Bay has his issues, and maybe the back end of this contract will be ugly, but for now he replaces what we thought we\'d get from Delgado last year, but from the right side. He will certainly be an improvement over Murph in left and is a .380 OBP guy who slugs over .500 and plays every day. 5. Which David Wright will we get this year? The guy who had his worst season as a pro, or the all-star we had for the previous four seasons. I remember arguments about who you\'d take first to start a team - Wright or Pujols (now that argument is Mauer or Pujols). Wright\'s anemic power may have been the result of little protection, adjustments to a new ballpark, girlfriend troubles, who knows... But, if you\'re so inclined, take a look at his numbers last year. Ignoring the low homerun total, it wasn\'t all that bad a year. In fact, it was a pretty good year (144 games, 80+ runs, 70+ rbis and a .390 OBP). Expect his slugging to improve some, Pujols to be caught on the juice and the argument to be Mauer vs. Wright. 6. This is the most underrated position upgrade on the team. Church was a AAAA player. Francoeur may not live up to the promise he showed in his early years as a Brave, but he has good pop, plays great defense in right (he has a sick cannon) and is a takes his lunchpail kind of guy. I wish he\'d learn to take a walk, but if you look at his numbers as a Met last year (.311 BA, 10 HR, 40 R, 41 RBI in 75 games), there\'s proof the change of scenery worked. 7. I\'m not a fan of Murph. Keith Hernandez is working with him on his defense. Thoughts are he\'ll platoon with Tatis. Maybe Jacobs will win the job. This is a hole, but on Opening Day last year we had Schneider. I\'m hoping for midseason upgrade here - maybe Dunn, or even Keith if he wants to put the uniform back on. 8. Barajas plays defense, hits homeruns and doesn\'t get on base much. He can throw folks out, which will be fun. Also, it\'s looking like Blanco will be Santana\'s ca,\'y, and I think that can help. Ok, so the seventh and eighth slots are problems. Still, we have reason to expect way more out of this offense than last year, even if there are some injuries. That leaves us with the bullpen... You have to look way back to find Mets team that had great team chemistry. Not that it\'s been bad with the recent Mets, but it definitely has not been great. A key component to a winning team, you can\'t buy chemistry. As a GM, putting a team together based on skills, stats, and baseball attributes is tough enough. When you a,\' in the layer of evaluating players\' personalities in a quest to create a team that will get along besides playing great baseball, there\'s no clear formula to success. GM\'s will target players that will help their club, and besides the few troubled players that some teams will stay away from for the fear of bringing in a ‘cancer\' to the locker room a la Milton Bradley, chemistry seems to fall under the radar most often than not when making these major investments. When the Mets picked up ‘Frenchie\' Jeff Francoeur, the last thing that factored into the decision was his personality. As long as he didn\'t kill any teammates or coaches in the past, the Mets were bringing him to Queens so they can rid themselves of Church. The Mets never thought anything to the effect of, \'this guys great in the clubhouse, lets find a way to get him\'. Well what do you know, Frenchie has brought some life to this team. Lets hope it translates to chemistry, which will at least give Mets fans some quality baseball to watch again. The last time I can truly say I saw a Mets team with great team chemistry, you have to look back to the days of Ron Darling, Tim Teufel and co., causing havoc in some honky tonk Texas bar. That was team chemistry at its finest, you just sensed it. Everyone hated them, outside of NY that is, but they had fun, played great together, and had each others backs no matter what. It was also the last time the New York Mets won the championship. Now we haven\'t seen any hotfoots out of Frenchie, but he\'s becoming a social leader on the team. Along with newcomer, Jason Bay, they set up a viewing party for the U.S. v Canada gold medal hockey game Sunday. According to Frenchie, Mets can expect more social gatherings this year. Our first trip this year is to Colorado, and we have a Monday night off. Guys can go out all day. But we should go out together at night. Let\'s go have a ball. As a player, these types of things make the clubhouse a more comfortable place to be in and a place they want to play in. Lets give credit where credit is due, Mets received a huge intangible with Frenchie at a low cost. Gold-Medal Chemistry Builder for Mets [MLB] As Spring approaches, I always get optimistic. Now that it looks like, save for the possible a,\'ition of a left-handed reliever, the roster is set, I can start to analyze what it is we have at each position. First, lets take a look at what all of sports radio, and every fan I talk to, says needed to be a,\'ressed this offseason - starting pitching. Let\'s look at the projected rotation vs. last year\'s Spring projection. 2009 Projected Starting Rotation 1. Johan Santana 2. Mike Pelfrey 3. Oliver Perez 4. John Maine 5. Tim Re,\'ing / Livan Herandez 2010 Projected Starting Rotation 1. Johan Santana 2. Mike Pelfrey 3. Oliver Perez 4. John Maine 5. Jon Niese / Fernando Nieve / Nelson Figueroa et al. What a difference a year makes? One through four are the same, and last year\'s depth is now this year\'s una,\'ressed problem. The common theory goes:\'you know you get with Johan (even though he\'s coming off elbow surgery), but 2, 3 and 4 are all head cases.\'Pelfrey regressed in an alarming manner, and you have to hope he\'ll bounce back in some way. In flashes during the 2008 season, he looked like a legitimate no. 2 starter. Ollie P is a head case, but also has been a big game pitcher for the Mets in the past (and still has electric stuff when focused). Perhaps I would have rather signed Randy Wolf to a one-year deal, and no way was Ollie worth three years a $12 million per, but we was coming off two pretty good seasons with the Mets, especially 2007. There was no reason to expect such a miserable 2009, and while many feel he was shut down due to a phony injury, people don\'t have surgery on phony injuries. John Maine was obviously still hurt, and maybe we don\'t know what we\'ll get from him. While that is a lot of uncertainty, short of signing Lackey or dealing for Halladay (neither of which was realistic for the Mets), there isn\'t much the Mets could do this offseason to fix it. Armes like Marquis and Pineiro don\'t move me much. Where I might have taken a chance are high-risk, high-reward guys like Sheets, Wang and Bedard. However, Sheets price himself out, and Wang and Bedard may not pitch until deep into the season (without the help of the Mets\' crack medical staff). What we hope for here is a few less injuries. Simply getting something close to 180 innings out of each of these guys will be a dramatic improvement over last season, especially because can\'t help but improve. Tomorrow I\'ll discuss the projected lineup and the various improvements over last year.
Morning Near Black Mesa\', Oil on Panel, 8x10 inches Jerry Lebo , 2008 Just a quick note to let you know how painting is going in New Mexico. We are having a great time, painting everyday, and traveling around this beautiful State. The above small painting was based on a some photos I took the other day on the way to Bandelier National Monument . To get there you travel by highway through the San Ildefonso and near the San Juan Pueblos. You can see it from miles around as you travel in the area. There is also another Black Mesa in the most Northern part of NM--this one is only about a half our north of Santa Fe. It was early in the day when we passed by, and we stopped on the side of the highway and took some photos--and I made some color notations and a quick sketch. The Mesa actually looks very dark most of the day--but in the early morning it takes on a pinkish/purple quality that was very compelling. I was reminded what a special place New Mexico is the other day by two of my readers. Cindy, who is one of my collectors, sent a comment on my last post--which reminded me of the uniqueness of the New Mexico landscape--and how the skies here are somehow different. In fact, last year when we were here I wrote a post titled\'Top Ten Reasons for an Artist to Live in Santa Fe\'. I re-read this post and say that the\'number one reason\'I cited for living in Santa Fe was\'clouds\'. And, I still think the clouds here are the most amazing you will see anywhere. In the morning, the sky here is usually very clear and blue, but when the clouds arrive later in the day, the show is often amazing--and worth the trip alone. I also got a nice note from Jacqueline Butler, welcoming me to New Mexico. Jacqueline is the artistic director for the organization\'Daily Painters of New Mexico\'. She lives near Galisteo and is thinking about starting a blog and is hosting a workshop for members. So, if you live in the area, drop her a note . Especially if you want to become a daily painter here in NM. I have talked about my own personal views on\'daily painting\'in previous posts--and I fully support the concept. I just don\'t think it is for me, personally. My own view is that finding time for\'daily painting\', is more important than trying to make a painting a day. So there you go. I highly recommend a trip to New Mexico to paint--or just to look around. I have been coming here for thirteen years now--usually once a year. And I am still inspired every time I visit. Who knows, I may even move here one day. I have met many people who come here for business or some other reason--and fall in love and stay. But, even if you can\'t get here, you can do the next best thing. Go to your studio and find an excuse to put a fantastic sky in one of your landscape paintings! All the best, sixtyminuteartist .\'Juniper View (Study)\', Jerry Lebo , 2008 Oil on Panel, 6x6 inches You have probably noticed it has been a while since my last post. Several of my regular readers have sent me personal emails asking if something is wrong. I appreciate everyone\'s concern, but I am okay—nothing terminal yet. As for the reasons behind my silence, the truth is that I have been dealing with some personal issues--and also have been busy at the day job—including two overseas trips. Fortunately, this has not kept me out of the studio for the most part--and I have been continuing to try to move forward with my work. The important thing is that I am still painting—and keeping my \'hour a day\' minimum discipline. The main reason I have not been blogging is that I have not really had much to say. I usually need some sort of inspiration or something to share with my readers in order to get me started writing a post. I don\'t want to bore people with my random thoughts. To be honest, I have also been struggling with which direction to take my art. The last few large\'color space\'painting I finished are sitting around my studio and pushing me to make another one. But, to tell the truth, I have been feeling like doing some small paintings. I am also torn a bit about how to balance my normally\'painterly\'style against the more graphic approach of my most recent paintings. I realize now that my \'style\' is something that took me many years to develop--and I am not sure I should simply throw it out. On the other hand, I still very interested in the ideas I have been pursuing in my recent work. So, why am I posting today? Well, I have a perfect excuse to do some small paintings—and share some ideas with you. We are on vacation in Santa Fe, NM for the next three weeks, and am working with my\'portable studio\', which is made by Open BoxM . I have written about the traveling setup I use for painting in past posts, and it is ideal for small paintings and studies. So I though I would post a few of these small paintings as they come off the easel over the next few weeks, as well as share some of my tips for painting when traveling. So here is my first travel tip. When traveling, I recommend you try painting on panels—instead of canvas. First, because panels are easy to pack, and you can buy them at most art stores these days. Most airlines are a,\'ing baggage charges for weight and second bags these days—and I managed to fit all my clothes and painting supplies for three weeks into one suitcase. You can also make your own panels when you get to your destination from supplies available most places ( I did a post that shows you how ). In fact, unless you are planning to paint big paintings—panels are the way to go in my mind. On the other hand, if you are set on canvas, I have found the best approach is to pack a variety of stretcher bars (taped together) and ship a roll of canvas to where you are painting. That way, you only have to bring the bars, staple gun, and pliers on your flight. If you are bringing large stretcher bars, you are probably not going to be able to fit these in a suitcase, so that means some extra costs. When you stretch your canvas upon arrival ( I did a post on that too ), leave enough edge overlap so as to be able to un -stretch your work. That way you can simply roll it up and take it home in a mailing tube when you leave. Okay, so there is a few tips for painting when traveling. For my current trip I decided to use Ampersand Gessobord . These panels are a bit more expensive than the ones I make at home, but not as expensive as some of the others out there. I started using these in my studio about 8 months back—and I am totally a,\'icted. The surface is so nice and has just the right tooth for taking paint—and the quality and consistency is high. I am not paid to promote their products, but I can recommend them without hesitation . The panels come in various sizes (and you can cut them to size). These are widely available these days, so you have probably seen them at your local art store. So there you go, hope you get a chance to paint outdoors during the summer. And, maybe even get a vacation somewhere so you can paint something new. If so, I will be offering a few tips over the next few weeks—so stay tuned. All the best, sixtyminuteartist .\'Sweet Escape\', Polymer on Canvas, 50x50 inches Jerry Lebo , 2008 \'I don\'t paint pictures in hopes that people will understand them. They understand them, or not, according to their own capacity.\' -- Pablo Picasso Okay, so I decided to submit a couple of my recent large paintings to a regional juried exhibit up in Fredrick, Maryland . They wanted artists to submit the actual paintings, so it was a bit of a chore framing and then carrying three very large paintings (the largest was 50x60 inches) 30 miles to the venue. Now the good/bad news, I found out that they accepted one of the paintings (the one in my last post, \'These five words \')--but rejected the others,\'Sweet Escape\'(above), as well as\'Dead Heroes\', the painting I put up two posts back. You are probably thinking, hey, you should be happy. You got a painting into a juried show, right? Well, it gets better. So I go up on Saturday to pick up the rejected paintings and haul them back to the studio--and when I get to the venue I find out that my artwork has been scattered around. One of the paintings is in a closet—with another painting leaning against it—which put a dent into the canvas. The other one is in an office, leaning against the wall behind a pile of other rejections. But, that wasn\'t the strangest part of it. The woman handing back the work had the\'jury sheet\'sitting there and was pleased to show me that the painting accepted into the show had a notation next to it...are you ready....it sai,\'dMaybe, if we have room\'. There you go--critical acclaim if I have ever heard it! I weakly made the point of saying, well, my paintings are rather large--so I understand if there was limited room (hoping for a bit more a positive response ), to which the woman replie,\'dOh, we have paintings in the show bigger than yours.\'Thud. I tired again on the way out, \'So have you given out awards yet.\' You can guess the response—\'Oh, yes, they are all given out.\' So, I am in the show, but barely--and definitely not the rapturous experience one hopes for. Okay, so what is an artist to do in when faced with such a situation? The short answer is brush it off. Get back in the studio as soon as possible and get painting again. I have seen artists send work to many galleries over the years, and most do not even get a polite rejection letter. Getting a form letter can be an achievement. With a juried exhibit, politeness is probably the best you can hope for. Even if you get your work into a group show or a gallery, you can expect that your work will be treated for what it is from a gallery perspective...a commodity—and I have heard of many cases where galleries have damaged work due to haphazard handling. Other artists are your worst enemy, as they tend to treat other artist\'s work with little regard (if they are not looking). I am serious. If you don\'t believe me, watch what happens when artists bring their work to a critique or for submission to a juried show--if no one is looking, other artist will not hesitate to move your work or treat it in a very haphazard way. I have seen it. To a gallery, you are just one in a long line of eager artist to get their work shown, so don\'t be surprised if a gallery generally acts like you\'re work is replaceable . At least until it sells for $50 grand or so--they tend to get more careful at that point. I think my recent experience also shows some important points to take into account when you think about where and how to send your work out. First and foremost, it is important to find a gallery or event that is interested in work and represents similar artists and/or types of work. I wrote about this early in my blog . But it is worth repeating. If you are painting\'cowboys and indians\', don\'t send your work to a New York gallery—you won\'t garner much interest. However, the good news is that they may be very excited in Tuscon . In the end, you need to decide before sending out work if it is likely to appeal to a certain gallery or jurist. In my case, I think it was the fact that my paintings were so different from all the other painterly and more formal painting that was submitted to the show, that it simply did not fit with the show or what was running through the jurist\'s mind. You want a show that hangs well together--not necessarily to show every type or style submitted--even I can understand that. Anyway, I thought I would share this experience, so you will be prepared. I know some of you are thinking about trying to break into galleries and submit your work to a show. If you are interested in reading more about how to better showcase your work and build your career as a visual artist, I will again recommend Cay Lang\'s book, \'Taking the Leap\'. I have mentioned it several times in my blog, but it is a great book. I went back to reading it again after my recent experience, and I could quickly see some of the mistake I made in submitting work to the regional exhibit. First of all, as I previously mentioned, these types of modern, hard edge, \'color space\' paintings don\'t really fit the style of the venue or the other art being shown there. So a tepid reception was probably inevitable. Second, I don\'t think they together really represent a cohesive artistic statement yet—since they are still evolving in terms of style and technique. This is not to say they are bad paintings, they are perhaps not quite ready for full public exposure or it was not the right venue. Anyway, live and learn. I hope you got something out of my experience that will help you build your career as an artist. All the best, sixtyminutearist .\'These Five Words in my Mind\'Polymer on Canvas, 60 x 50 inches Jerry Lebo, 2008 \'The progression of a painter\'s work, as it travels in time from point to point, will be towards clarity: toward the elimination of all obstacles between the painter and the idea, and between the idea and the observer.\' --Mark Rothko I though this was a fitting quote for the above painting—and relates back to my own experience lately. As you know, I have making a radical change in my painting style over the last few months, and I have been getting a lot of questions as to \'why\'? The short answer can be found in the above quote—in that I felt a real need to simplify my work and eliminate the obstacles between what I was trying to say in my paintings—and to send that idea more directly to the observer. The above painting, \'These Five Words in my Mind\' was motivated by a very simple idea that I had been thinking about for a few months—that is, how do words and colors relate? And could you make a painting that had the effect of words—in terms of evoking a response of the observer? And how could you change the colors and shapes to change the meaning and sensation of a painting? Let me explain. Let\'s say you have five words. There are a lot of different things you can say with those five words. Change one word, and you can chance the entire meaning of what you are saying. Take, for example, the two phrases, \'I would hate to love you\', and \'I would love to hate you\'. These phrase contain the same six words—but you immediately feel different depending on which one is said. In a way, color is the same way. You can make a lot of different paintings with a set of five colors—and if you change one color, the entire sensation will also change. Of course, most paintings have dozens or thousands of colors—but do they need all of them? Which ones are important to send the meaning? And which ones will change the meaning of the painting—these are the questions I was asking myself when I thinking about the above painting. For this painting, I purposely chose five colors you would probably never see reflected in water—and except the blue—would not likely make anybody think \'water\'. Then I tried to make a painting that said \'water\' on one hand through the subject matter—but in a very minimal way. In fact, the main purpose was to combine five colors into a certain sensation—that is to send a sensation through a certain color \'note\' or harmony. Also, I used shapes moving from larger to smaller (and hard edge to soft) to give the painting a sense of moving back in space—so that the five colors soon become \'color\', \'space\', and \'sensation\' all at the same time-(by combining in your eye)—just like a certain phrase would (or even five music notes) do as they are uttered or played. You cannot hear the individual words or notes—only feel the sensation. I know it probably all sounds pretty crazy—but that is what I was thinking about before I started this painting and while I was painting it—the sensation of five words running around my head. Okay, so how does this relate to the subject of this post? Well, I have been thinking a lot about how paintings communicate and what that means for how artists might approach their paintings. One of the things I think is important is that an artist at least be clear about the motivation for painting before moving to the easel. I have heard instructors say that you must \'have one idea\' or that you should \'focus on the main idea of the painting\' while you paint. I have known that to be true based on my own experience. When I start to paint with one idea in mind (say, capturing the feeling of a sunset) and then start focusing on something else half way through (such as the the color of the mountains)—it is more than likely going to led to a bad painting. The fact is, that a successful paintings are those that deliver a clear message to the observer—as simply as possible. If the artist is not clear—how can he/she expect the observer to see it clearly? So what does this mean for starting a painting? Well, obviously, I think the first step is to make sure you know what you want to say before you start a painting. That is, do you want to say something about something you are seeing, feeling, or something that pleases you visually? Keep that idea in your mind as you plan and work on the painting. Make it as simple as possible. My experience is this simple approach will lead to better outcomes. Successful paintings require a lot of pre-meditation. Many painters and students focus so much on the mechanics of painting—color mixing and drawing—they forget about the \'why\'. So next time you are about to start a painting. Take a few moments to think about why you have chosen the subject. Ask some hard questions about what attracts you to that subject or landscape. Really work through your motivation for starting a painting—before you start mixing colors and drawing on the canvas—and stick with this idea throughout. Try to get that idea onto the canvas. When you step back from the canvas, ask yourself not if looks like the subject matter—but if it feels like it . Not if the drawing is good, but if the sensation is good. Does the figure feel like it is standing? Not is the gesture correct, but does it feel correct? Why is this important—because when the observer sees your work—this is what he/she will feel right away more than any amount of good drawing or careful color mixing. The idea or message of a painting comes to the viewer in one quick moment as a feeling (like five spoken words)—and so you need to be sure that you are communicating and assessing your paintings at that level. Okay, I know this is a bit touchy feely for some of you. But I hope you got something out if it. All the best, sixtyminuteartist .\'Untitled\'(Study), Polymer on Paper, 17 1/2 x 23 Inches Jerry Lebo, 2008 The weather is getting better in DC, so I have been able to stroll around during my lunch hour and take a few pictures that I can use as reference material in the studio. I am thankful for my digital camera—not only can I look at the picture right after it is taken—but I can take hundreds of pictures and then simply delete the bad ones. I end up throwing out most of the pictures I take, in any case. In the past, I used to pay to develop a whole roll of film and then throw out the majority of the shots. So I love my digital camera. Anyway, the above study is one of the paintings I am thinking of making into one of the large \'color space\' paintings that I have been talking about in my blog recently. The study is based on a photo I took last week when I was walking near the Hirshhorn Museum . I like the unusual composition—and thought it would be a good opportunity to explore various color harmonies. I usually do these sorts of painting studies using acrylics and sometimes oils (I gesso the paper for oils). I really struggled with the color relationships in this study and it took me quite a while to figure out how to get the effect I was after. The reference photo and painting are quite different. I have put the reference photo below so you can see the changes I made—basically I re-worked the entire color harmony in pursuit of what I have been talking about recently—that is, how to evoke a certain psychological response in the viewer using color. One of the problems when moving from a small study to a large painting is that a painting that looks good small—may not look good in a larger format. The reverse also holds true, that a large painting may not be very interesting if painted in a smaller format. You have to decide to \'go big\' or not based on a smaller studies—and it is not always easy to imagine the effect. Anyway, I am thinking of trying the above painting in a large (50x66 inches) format—what do you think? Send me a comment. Okay, so let\'s get to the point of this post—which is how to use \'color references\' in the studio. I have increasingly found that I am nearly blind when it comes to color. I know that sounds strange—but the light in my studio is always changing, my mood changes, and even my sight seems to change when I am in the studio. I look at a color at one moment—and it looks greenish—and then two minutes later it looks to have change to a bluish color. I have written about this in some previous posts—but I think color is the hardest part of being an artist. It is such a moving target—even for a trained artist. One solution I have come to increasingly rely on is the uses of color reference materials. That is, pieces of color that I have lying around my studio—that can serve as a neutral reference point. For example, in just moving from the easel to the palette—sometimes my thoughts about a color change. I might think I have the right color when I am mixing it on the palette—and then get to the canvas and change my mind. So which color is right? The one I was seeing on the palette or the one I have on my brush? It depends, of course, on what color I was after. Which I might have forgotten by the time I am ready to make the stroke—since I am daydreaming about something else most of the time anyway! Color references don\'t need to be expensive or complicated. They can be pieces of paper you paint yourself—or colored paper that you buy. You can use a color matching system—such as Pantone—or make up your own system. Color charts are also a popular way of color referencing—and can be keyed back to the paints you are using. Basically, what you want from a color referencing system is something that you can refer to that is unchanging! Examples of color references that I have used in my own studio include PMS swatches , color-aid paper , and premixed color charts . The key to using a color reference is to understand what it can—and can\'t do. A color reference is not a solution to a problem. It is not a preset color harmony that you can use in a painting (I don\'t think this is possible anyway). The benefits of a color reference system in my mind are two. First, it is a tool you can use to work out how colors (and values) will affect each other before you put them onto the canvas. In some ways, this can lead to new color harmonies—but in my experience it can also keep you from mixing the wrong colors or going in circles. Second, and in my mind equally important, color references can be used to bridge the gap between the color you are seeing in your mind and the one you are mixing on the palette. For example, when you think \'blue\'— what blue are you thinking about . If you can pick out the \'blue\' you want from a color reference system before you start mixing—then you can more quickly know if you mixed the right color. If you are not convinced yet—try this experiment. Think about a color you want to use in your paintings. Say, a sky color—or the color of the grass on a sunny day. Next time you are in the studio—try to mix it. Or, better yet, look out the window and mix it based on what you are seeing. Once you have mixed the color, put it aside for the moment. Next, find a piece of paper or other reference material that is as close as possible to the color you are after. You can again compare it directly (by holding it up to the window, for example). Now, mix the color again but with the reference color sitting on your palette. Now go back and compare the color you mixed when you did not have the reference—and the one you mixed when you had the reference nearby. Which is closer to the color you were after? I think you will see my point pretty quickly. Having a neutral reference can get you closer to where you are going--and faster. I am a strong believer in having as much information around you as possible when you are in the studio. Photos are an accepted material for artists to use. But this is only one form of information— and not a very good one at that ! I also am a firm believer in color references. There are numerous ways to use these to improve you paintings—color mixing only being one. Okay, that\'s it for now. Go to the studio and paint. All the best, sixtyminuteartist .\'Dead Heroes\', Polymer on Canvas, 47 x 66 inches Jerry Lebo, 2008 I have been busy over the last few weeks working on several large paintings, which has proven to be a big challenge. The above painting is the first to come off the easel, and is about as big as I can effectively paint in my basement studio. Here is a shot of what it looked like on the easel, to give you an idea of the scale. As you can see, I am continuing to pursue the approach I started in the painting of our dog I showed you in my last post. The intent is to push the color harmony ideas I have been talking about over the last few months. That is, to bring together the color interactions in such a way as to make a psychological \'color space\' which is integral to the subject and message of the painting--and transforms the viewer\'s experience. The painting itself is based on a photo I took this summer at the World War II memorial here in DC. I made a photo album for my Great Uncle who recently died—as he was too ill to travel to see the Memorial himself. The picture is of one of the waterfalls that they have at each end of the memorial (one each for the Atlantic and Pacific Campaigns)—this one being the Pacific. My Great Uncle was in the Pacific during WWII—and survived the sinking of his ship and his shipmates being eaten by sharks. I have fond memories of how he used to tell me war stories. He is one of the big influences of my youth—always around during the summers I spent in Indiana as a kid. He died a couple of months back after a long battle with prostate cancer. I will miss him--and I suppose the painting is a bit of a memorial to his memory. Okay, so back to the subject of the post—painting shadows. This post has been lurking in my mind for a couple of weeks--and is motivated by one of the key issues I see people struggling with in their paintings. Often we stand back from the easel--and wonder what is wrong with a painting and think\'color\'. But, which color? Most of the time we look at the higher value and high chroma hues and start messing around with those--but in fact it may be the shadows that are the problem. Frankly, I see this over and over in my students work--they pay a lot of attention to the colors where the light is hitting an object or the landscape--but then mix up some pretty boring, or even plain bad, shadow colors. The first message I want to get across is: shadows are colors! Let me say it again another way: the color you are putting in the shadow is just as important as the color you are putting on the highlight. If either one is wrong--the painting will suffer. Okay, so how do you find the right shadow color? Well, first, you need to be able to see the shadow color. So let me give you a little exercise that I have learned that will help developed your mind and eyes to better see shadow colors. If you do this exercise regularly, it will improve your painting. I promise. It is a little exercise I call,\'find the shadow color\'. The exercise starts by finding a piece of paper that is a single color and at least around four or five inches square in size. It doesn\'t matter where it comes from--out of a magazine, book cover, or simply paint a piece of paper. Next, take the piece of paper and put it a few feet away from you in a location where it is being hit by light. It can be natural light coming in from a window (if you are in the studio)--or light from a lamp. Doesn\'t matter. Once you have your color/paper sitting there, take a moment to really notice the color. Take a long look--try to remember what it looks like. Is it warm or cool? What is the hue? Try to memorize the color. Next, take the same piece of paper and put it somewhere nearby where it is not being hit by light--but the color is still observable (not in the closet!). For example, if you had the paper sitting on a table, put it on the floor next to the table in the shadow of a table. If it was in the light coming in a window, put it in a place where the light is not directly hitting it. Notice the change in color. Take a long look--try to remember what the new color looks like--how did it change when you moved it out of the light? Did it get warmer or cooler? What is the hue? Again, try to memorize the color--and think about how it compares to the color when it was lighted. Move it back and forth between light and shadow and notice what happens. Okay, now the fun part. Go and find another piece of paper (or paint one) that is the color of the paper when it is not being hit by light. This is a lot harder than it sounds. I did this in my office the other day and it took me a good fifteen minutes to find two objects where the color of one was the shadow color of the other. The test that you have the right color is simple. Put the two pieces of paper in light together, then move the original piece (the one you first chose and observed in light) into the shadow. If you have the right shadow color, the two pieces of paper should appear to be the same color. Below are some pictures to give you a better idea of how this works. The first photo below is of the two pieces of paper that I determined were shadow and highlight colors. They are actually the covers of two publications I had sitting around my office. This is how they look sitting on my desk as lighted by the lighting in my office. So, how do I know that the darker color is the shadow color of the lighter one? Simple, I put the lighter color on the floor off the edge of my desk so that I could see them next to the other. In effect, so that the darker one was in the light, but the lighter one was in shadow. Below is a photo of the result--taken with the darker one sitting on the desk and the lighter one on the floor in shadow. You can see that they have effectively become the same color. And, yes, the one on the floor is the lighter color in the above photo. Hard to believe I know. Try this exercise in various lighting conditions and types of light. Finding two colors that work may be a bit of a struggle at first, but you will get better at it. If you do it as a regular exercise, you may be surprised how it improves your ability to paint shadow colors (the first thing you will notice is that shadows are colors--and they have predictable relationships!). Your mind will remember how colors in shadow and light relate--which will make you quicker at finding the right shadow color. There are a lot of variations on this exercise that can help you out in the studio. For example, say I was painting a still life with an object in it that I was having a hard time finding the right (or even simply believable) shadow color. A simple guide might be to paint a piece of paper the color I was using for the object in light, and another piece the shadow color I was using. Then I could do the same as I did above to compare the shadow color to othe other paper\'in shadow\'--and if the relationship was correct. Even if the match was not perfect, I would expect the temperature and general hue would be in the same range. If the two colors are off--you will see it pretty quickly--trust me. One of the things you will notice right away is that the shadow color of something in natural light is much cooler that a shadow of the same object indoors under normal house lighting. Which means, for example, that the relationships indoors are different than those you would see if you did the same exercise (with the same colors) outdoors. Which means that if you are painting landscapes, use natural lighting for the exercise--and preferably do it outdoors. Also, the shadow color of an object will vary with the distance you are away from it. So, if you move one of the pieces of paper closer or farther away from you--the relationships change. So, think of it as a way to train your eyes and guide your thinking--not a scientific experiment. So there you go. A simple exercise to help you explore shadow colors--and to get
This morning, artist/sculptor Mike Kraus sent me images of the clay mold he has recently completed of the sword that will soon be replaced on the General James Nagle statue. Simply stated, I am blown away by the level of detail. Indeed, this is an exact rendering of the sword Nagle was presented following his return from the Mexican-American War and of the bronze sword that was originally placed on the monument in 1904. I think you will agree with me that this is superb, stellar work. I certainly could not be happier. The next step is the bronzing!
There\'s been a lot of talk recently about this brrreeeport thing... Traffic has been slow to NFK ever since the pixels fad died down but let\'s see if this does anything to bring more people to the blog! -Steve- We got a nice mention in the Wall Street Journal today. Alex Tew is auctioning off the last 1000 pixels of the Million Dollar Homepage and the author mentioned some of the other pixel sites. If you would like to support the cause, please donate as little as $5 to help. -Steve- Bi,\'ers Vie to Purchase Last Web-Screen Sections; Copycat Sites Now Abound January 10, 2006; Page B8 In late November, this column talked about Alex Tew, a 21-year-old British man who, in a quest to fund his university studies, had arrived at the seemingly outlandish idea of creating a Web site and selling advertising in the form of\'pixels\'-- the simplest graphical denominator of a computer screen -- for a buck each. His goal: one million dollars. What made the story noteworthy then was that Mr. Tew had already passed the halfway mark despite having no target audience or even the slightest bit of brand recognition. As of tomorrow, Mr. Tew could not only reach his million-dollar goal, he could surpass it by auctioning off the last 1,000 pixels for www.milliondollarhomepage.com on eBay. Further, Mr. Tew\'s business model has inspired hundreds, perhaps thousands, of copycat sites angling to find a new twist on pixel sales for whatever their needs may be. Alex Tew, creator of milliondollarhomepage.com, and his father, Malcolm Tew, pictured the weekend before Alex\'s last pixels are auctioned on eBay. As an entrepreneurial venture, Mr. Tew\'s stands out given his young age, global influence and quick return on an estimated $40,000 investment to host and publicize the site. On Aug. 26, Mr. Tew launched his home page and divided the screen into 10,000 small squares of 100 pixels each. He sold pixels for $1 each, with a minimum order of 100 pixels and promised to keep the page alive for at least five years. In each space, buyers could put a graphical ad of their choosing, linking it to their own site. Today the home page resembles a cluttered collage of ads in various shapes and colors. Internet Celebrity Meantime, Mr. Tew himself has taken on celebrity status in the Internet community. World-wide solicitations have swamped his email in-box; he says there are currently 10,000-plus unanswered messages soliciting him for everything from money and business advice to job positions. Getty Images, which provides film and photo images to media outlets and others, just conducted a portrait session with Mr. Tew and his parents in Cricklade, England. In fact, all the attention has persuaded Mr. Tew to postpone his university studies -- an ironic turn of events given that school was the original impetus for his project.\'I never expected the site to reach the level of success it has done,\'he writes in an email.\'But I can\'t see how I can realistically continue my studies in the immediate future -- due to the sheer scale of interest in my site, and all the new opportunities that have presented themselves as a result. There just isn\'t time now.\'He says he will return to school in September. By the end of 2005, Mr. Tew had sold 999,000 pixels and demand outstripped supply for the last thousand. On Dec. 30, the page had one million unique visitors and Mr. Tew\'s server almost died, he says, forcing him to temporarily suspend order taking. Gi,\'y prospective buyers pushed him to open a second page, but Mr. Tew had pledged to close the page when his goal of one million dollars was reached in order to protect its originality. Final Auction So over the New Year, Mr. Tew decided to do what any calculating businessman might: He put the last 1,000 pixels up for sale on eBay. The auction ends tomorrow at 1:42 p.m. EST; as of 6 p.m. last night, the highest offer from a pool of bi,\'ers handpicked by Mr. Tew was $160,109.09. He expects to net about $650,000 to $700,000 after costs, taxes and a donation he plans to give to The Prince\'s Trust, a U.K. charity for youth that once helped him. Mr. Tew\'s efforts benefited from newness, shrewd marketing and the Internet\'s lightning-speed word of mouth. After first persuading his friends and family to buy pixels to make the page seem legitimate, he then began touting his site, and himself, to bloggers, who directed traffic Mr. Tew\'s way. The media in Britain picked up on his venture, fueling more visitors. In mid-September, Mr. Tew\'s Web site landed on the\'Movers & Shakers\'feature of Alexa.com, which ranks the world\'s Web sites by the number of people who visit them. Marketing executives often troll Alexa.com, which is owned by Amazon.com, to check out what\'s hot and what\'s not, and at one point Mr. Tew\'s site reached Alexa\'s No. 2 spot. That brought in a new wave of advertisers. In October, a U.S. publicist named Imal Wagner contacted him about penning his life story; he declined but hired her to help him with a U.S. media tour. Pixel Mania The attention inspired rival sites. One attractive 22-year-old Siberian emergency worker has posted her own black-and-white photo on a home page; as people buy pixels on www.presentmecolor.com the image metamorphoses to color. At www.boxofstars.com two filmmakers are selling digital\'stars\'-- orbs of light of various hues and size that bounce about the home page and link to other sites -- to raise $50,000 and finance their picture. In a marriage of online and outdoor advertising, www.stickermyhummer.com encourages buyers to purchase ads on an online picture of the body of a Hummer H2; when that\'s filled the site\'s owner, a California State University student promises he\'ll buy a real one and wrap it in a graphical composite of the ads. There are charity sites, sites devoted to erotica, and plain-vanilla financial Web sites all using pixels to raise funds. An Indiana University student has even launched a parody site called www.trumpingalex.com , complete with a fake image of Mr. Tew sporting Donald Trump-esque hair. While none of these seem to have replicated Mr. Tew\'s success, and it\'s unclear if they ever will, the sheer volume of attempts and creative juice behind them paints an interesting picture of collective online entrepreneurship around the globe. And at the very least, it suggests there will be an eventual shakeout of what works, and what doesn\'t. For instance, one site, www.worldofpersia.com , targets a single ethnic group and purports to have sold 1,900 pixels in two days. Two Carnegie Mellon students started www.nickelsforkatrina.org to raise money for hurricane victims. Meantime, people are tweaking their pages\' graphical elements to stand out: A Frenchman launched www.monpremiermillion.com where people place ads on a map of his homeland and www.yournameonthemoon.com solicits people to post missives on a lunar image. Currently, Mr. Tew is holed up at home in Cricklade with his mom and dad, monitoring his auction on a 17-inch Hewlett-Packard laptop from his parents\' living room and sleeping from 5 a.m. till 9 a.m. to keep up with U.S. time zones. His folks screen his calls -- their son\'s numbers got posted on the Internet -- and siblings helped sort through the last round of orders. Mr. Tew says he paid them. Says his 58-year-old dad, Malcolm Tew:\'Alexander has always had lots and lots of ideas, some good and some not so good. This is certainly the most, ah, fruitful.\'Write to Gwendolyn Bounds at wendy.bounds@wsj.com We got written up today in the Pittsburgh Post Gazette. http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/05329/611718.stm Sorry for the sparse posting. The last couple weeks at school have been pretty busy and we haven\'t had much time to work on the site. Our official count is up to $2,555 and we\'re trying to drive some more traffic in the coming weeks. The group I went to Mississippi with is following up with the people we helped out and we will be presenting a report on our trip to the university. I will have an update on this in a week or so. There was an interesting article in the Wall Street Journal today about the pixels phenomenon. Unfortunately, they didn\'t mention us but it sheds some light on the wave of interest around such an arbitrary thing. http://online.wsj.com/article/SB113261806930503580.html?mod=technology_main_promo_right Pipe Dream How Selling Pixels May Yield a Million Bucks November 22, 2005; Page B1 It was just a few months ago that 21-year-old Alex Tew of Great Britain was stumped about how to pay for college. He\'d filled a notebook with ideas before jotting down this simple, if rather audacious, query to himself: How Can I Become a Millionaire? In the annals of entrepreneurship, what followed is an instructional tale of how a brainstorm, coupled with the Internet\'s powerful word-of-mouth culture, can set a trend in motion with lightning speed. Mr. Tew says his strategy was to find an idea simple to understand and cheap to set up, with a catchy name that would garner attention online, where he gained experience from having free-lanced as a Web designer for a few years. Ultimately, his solution amounted to making money via Internet advertising -- but with a twist. Instead of selling banner ads, text links or splashy videolike ads that fill a screen, Mr. Tew opted to hawk the simplest graphical denominator of a computer screen: the pixel. A pixel is a tiny dot of light and color, and each screen has tens of thousands of them. Mr. Tew created a home page, www.milliondollarhomepage.com , where he divided the screen into 10,000 small squares of 100 pixels each. His plan: to sell the pixels for $1 a piece, with a minimum order of 100 pixels. In each space, buyers could put a graphical ad of their choosing that links to their own site when clicked on. The end result is a cluttered collage of ads in various shapes and colors all amassed on a single digital billboard. (Mr. Tew doesn\'t charge his advertisers anything when a visitor clicks on the ads.) Mr. Tew pledged to keep the site up for at least five years and to close the page when his goal of one million dollars was reached.\'I had to think big,\'he says. The notion seemed absurd. Who would want to advertise on an unknown site that had no target audience, no track record of attracting visitors or even the slightest brand recognition? But as with many gimmicks, its newness gave it legs, as did Mr. Tew\'s shrewd marketing. He first roped his friends and family into buying pixels and placing ads to make the page seem legitimate. He then began touting his site, and himself, to bloggers, who wrote about his crazy idea and linked to the site, which directed traffic his way. The media in Britain picked up on his efforts, fueling more visitors. Within two weeks of the site\'s Aug. 26 launch Mr. Tew says he sold $40,000 in ads. More important, the traffic numbers started gaining attention among the U.S. Internet community. Since its launch, the site has received a total of about 1.5 million unique visitors. In mid-September, it landed on the\'Movers & Shakers\'feature of Alexa.com, which ranks the world\'s Web sites by the number of people who visit them. Marketing executives often troll Alexa.com, which is owned by Amazon.com, to check out what\'s hot and what\'s not, and at one point Mr. Tew\'s site reached Alexa\'s No. 2 spot. Currently, the site gets 600,000 to 700,000 unique visitors a month. As of yesterday evening, Mr. Tew said he was $623,800 toward his goal, more than enough to pay for college and earmark some cash for his next entrepreneurial venture, he says. (He keeps a running tally of his sales on the Web site, and though the figure can\'t be independently verified, screenshots emailed by Mr. Tew of his PayPal and other checkout accounts appear to support his claim.) While there\'s also no way of knowing for sure whether Mr. Tew is the first entrepreneur to sell pixels, the idea was new enough that it felt that way to onlookers.\'I was like, \'What\'s this?\'says Daniel Khesin, vice president of marketing at DS Laboratories Inc., a skin-care company in Lake Success, N.Y. After examining Mr. Tew\'s site, he says:\'There was nothing inherently special about the page, but it was very obvious to us that at the very least, buying some pixels would be a good idea for the sheer number of visitors he was getting.\'DS Laboratories purchased 800 pixels. Almost overnight, he says, traffic surged at the company\'s Web site by twentyfold, and all of the increase came from milliondollarhomepage.com. More impressive, he says, sales by Internet companies that DS Laboratories\' site links to jumped almost 50% within a week of the ad going up.\'Our skepticism was that this is untargeted traffic,\'Mr. Khesin says.\'But this advertising has definitely paid for itself many times forward. And unlike banner advertising where it goes away, people will always know where to find it to go back and purchase more products.\'Similarly, Chris Magras, president Evisions Marketing Inc. in Tempe, Ariz., which helps Web sites get higher rankings on search services, also noted milliondollarhomepage.com\'s movement on Alexa.com.\'Some people would say it\'s a bad idea, some would say it\'s a good one. All I know is that it was generating interest,\'Mr. Magras says. Evisions bought 6,400 pixels and its ad went up on a Friday. The following Monday morning, Evisions was getting 2,000 more unique visitors to its home page, all linked directly from milliondollarhomepage.com. The number of leads, or visitors filling out personal information on the Evisions site, jumped to 300 a day from 100.\'It was quality traffic,\'Mr. Magras says.\'It was definitely the biggest payoff for a one-stop ad buy we\'ve ever had.\'He a,\'s that the company is still getting 800 to 1,000 new visitors daily from Mr. Tew\'s site. Copycats popped up almost immediately; now there are hundreds of Web sites selling pixels, some of them directly crediting Mr. Tew -- and even linking to his site. Some advertisers have put out press releases touting their alliances with Mr. Tew\'s site, further helping spike his traffic. The risk, of course, is that as the original pixel concept gets mimicked, it will suffer from brand dilution and become a less compelling a business model. What\'s more, as milliondollarhomepage.com has filled up, it\'s become harder for advertisers to stand out amid a busy screen with messages ranging from\'CasinoScams\'and\'Free Ringtones\'to\'Jesus\'and\'Hypnosis\'; the smallest ad spaces, at 100-pixels square, are nearly indecipherable at this point. Whether Mr. Tew reaches a million dollars remains to be seen. He readily notes that he\'d never do another site like the original. Now, he says,\'the copycats are all competing with each other.\'One is Moneypants.com , a personal finance Web site geared toward women that says it has 600 members and has collected $4,500 over the last few weeks from its own pixel\'Dream Page\'-- a decent chunk of change for a nascent enterprise.\'It\'s very compelling,\'says MoneyPants Chief Executive Komal Bhojwani.\'We don\'t have to end up going the investor route, which might require us to make changes to the business that we don\'t want to make. And we didn\'t have to get into debt by borrowing from a bank. We are generating revenue and not expenses.\'One advertiser, Cherryl Weaver, says she\'s seen a 13% jump in traffic to her real estate Web site, www.hotlaneighborhoods.com , from the 1,500 MoneyPants.com pixels she bought.\'As long as it\'s a strategic alliance, it makes sense,\'Ms. Weaver says, alluding to the affinity between a personal-finance site and real estate.\'Would I team up with McDonald\'s if they did a dream page? No.\'Meantime, James Thomson, a Web designer in Branson, Mo., says he\'s wiped out $30,000 in personal debt accumulated after the dot-come bust with his site, www.millionpennyhomepage.com , by selling pixels by the penny, instead of the dollar. Yesterday, he had only $974 left to go before reaching his goal of $10,000. And Christian Abad, president of Accessible Computing Inc. in Charlotte, N.C., is trying to lure new clients to his pixel page, called www.pixelads4all.com , by giving them a 50% discount off their pixel purchases. Sales have been slow, but he remains optimistic about the overall concept and has even purchased 11 domain names in anticipation of a future in pixel advertising. Among them: pixelads4shopping.com and pixelads4porn.com. For his part, Mr. Tew says he wants to keep milliondollarhomepage.com online\'forever.\'If and when a million pixels are sold, he says he\'ll leave the page frozen in time, no changes allowed, no new buyers permitted. His ultimate goal is as lofty as the original concept: He hopes his site will be like a time capsule showing\'what\'s possible on the Internet\'-- an iconic image that he imagines\'one day might be a piece of art in a museum.\'Write to Gwendolyn Bounds at wendy.bounds@wsj.com This week was a pretty positive week for us. Getting listed on the Blogs of Note was great for our traffic and we\'ve been logging about 300 uniques per day to the main site. We\'ve broken $2275 and we should have it all updated by tonight. Few ideas being tossed around right now...One of them brought to our attention has been broadening the scope of where we put our donations. Although Katrina needs financial help, there are other natural disasters occuring in the US and around the world. All of the money would still got the Red Cross, but we would donate it into different hurricane reliefs such as Wilma, Rita and the Earthquakes in Pakistan. Please post some comments in the forums and let us know what you think. Any name change ideas? Thank you to everyone who has been buying up pixels. Your support is appreciated. We\'ve been getting some interesting donors from sites such as Save The Ta-Tas and Doombuggies . Wouldn\'t it be funny if someone bought up pixels to propose...like on the megatron at a baseball game? -Steve and Keith- For the final leg of our time in Mississippi we were supposed to be working on projects further south, towards New Orleans. Because of how day-to-day things happen, however, these projects were unable to happen. On our way back I got some pictures of the damage that is still evident in the area. The golden arches - just about all of the street signs were blown out like this. It is shocking to see miles of commercial areas with businesses that still have not fully recovered from the disaster. We passed by a CVS that was operating out of a trailer. It is amazing that when people need something like medicine, quick and dirty solutions are thrown up to fill that need. The weekend spent in Mississippi was a great experience. In the short time that we were there, we were able to make an impact. Although not all of the projects we lined up happened as planned, just being able to help others in need made the trip worth it. A student group on campus, Alternative Break will be making a follow-up trip to the region in the beginning of January. On a side note, none of the money for this trip came out of NickelsForKatrina.org . This was a trip organized by the Division of Student Affairs at Carnegie Mellon University. With the generous help of Shernell Smith and Rowshawn Palmer, we were able to get it together on such short notice. Thank you to everyone who has been reading, commenting, donating and putting up our banner. Your support is appreciated. -Steve and Keith- Free Cellphones for Katrina Victims :\'The FCC has approved a plan by the feds to give all Katrina evacuees free cellphones with 300 minutes of talk time. Now I\'m sure they\'re not handing out pink RAZRs to those in need so it\'s not an issue of logistics. So when did Katrina happen? Oh right, almost 2 months ago. I\'m sure if someone needed a cellphone, they\'d have it by now. What about people affected by more recent hurricanes like Wilma? There\'s trouble in paradise down in Floridia and I\'m sure they could use those hot Cingular and Tracfone phones right about now. Anyway, enough kvetching. The offer is open to every household approved for housing assistance by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, according to the FCC. Give \'em a call if you need something... oh. That\'s right. Just hit the web... oh. Poop. Feds give out free phones to Katrina evacuees [Textually]\'We got some more donations to the site yesterday. One that we thought was particularly interesting is another non-profit: Save The Ta-Tas . They sell clever T-Shirts to benefit breast cancer. Their link is in the upper left hand corner of the site . Be sure to check them out.
Yesterday, the PS22 Chorus of 2010 sang the national anthem at The New York Rangers game in Madison Square Garden ! The kids brought the crowd to an incredible roar of thunderous applause, as can be seen in the video below! What an afternoon!! The usher outside our suite where we watched the game said in his 20 years working at MSG, he would place our rendition of the anthem in the Top 5 versions that he\'s heard! And Greg , our contact from the Rangers camp, e-mailed and sai,\'dBelieve me   I work every home game and tonight was the loudest applause I have ever heard at the Garden for an anthem. I truly hope we can make this an annual tradition. To top it off, you guys brought us luck during a team slump, as the Rangers got a big win!\'AWESOME!! After their incredible performance of the anthem, all the kids were ushered to 3 VIP suites, where they got to watch the game! While there, they were visited by former Rangers, Gilles Villemure & Pete Stemkowski , who signed autographs and spoke with the kids! Not only that, we ran into America\'s Next Top Model contestant, April Wilkner , who now works for MSG as a TV correspondent. She was as cool as can be, and a great sport, letting Ethan get in some more celebrity sniffing! During a TV break during the second period of the game, they showed the video filmed by our new friend Faith that we filmed at school the other day of\'Empire State Of Mind ,\'which was spliced with highlights from the season! It was so great hearing the kids and seeing them on the jumbo-tron! The kids all got hot dogs, chips, soda, balloons, and programs courtesy of the Rangers! Thanks to the team, Greg, & Faith, for all their incredible hospitality and for a day the PS22 Chorus will not soon forget! And thanks to Ms. Lisa, Mrs. Johnson, Ms. Laurie, & Ms. Massimo , for capturing the day for us with all the great pics and video footage!! This week, the PS22 Chorus of 2010 is on fire! Starting it off with a viral smash of\'Lisztomania\'by Phoenix , the kids have brought in a whole new bunch of fans from not only the States, but from countries like France, Brazil, Germany,and more! The chorus earned 2 Top 10 YouTube honors for the week and a whole slew of others, while making its homepage the #7 Most Viewed Music Channel this week! (That places it even higher than Beyonce\'s channel which currently weighs in at #13! Craziness!!) Also this week, the chorus was invited to perform and make its plea for the arts at the District 31 IDEAL parent forum, which you can see in the video at the top of the post. We thank long-time friend of the chorus, Joan McKeever Thomas (see pic below), for this wonderful opportunity to invest in the future of our chorus children\'s arts education. The kids did us proud as always, and we hope that in sharing both their talent and their story, we made an impact. So how can PS22 top a week like this? Well get ready, because we\'re going to give it the ol\' elementary school try! Indeed there\'s lots more excitement on the way! On Sunday afternoon, the kids will be appearing at Madison Square Garden , where they will be singing the national anthem at the New York Rangers game! Earlier this week, we got a visit from Greg &amp; Faith representing the team, who shot footage of the kids singing their version of\'Empire State of Mind Pt. XXII\'that will be played at the game alongside highlights of the season. Unfortunately, that video will not be able to be broadcast, but the MSG Network is supposed to be airing the kids\' singing of the anthem, though it may be later on in the game during an intermission. Exciting stuff!! Puck drop is at 3:00 PM EST so set those TIVOS &amp; DVRs! Then on Tuesday, prepare for yet another brilliant PS22 Chorus collaboration! The kids will be joining reggae artist Matisyahu on stage at the 92nd Street Y in N.Y.C.!! They\'ll be performing their version of Matisyahu\'s\'One Day\'with the man himself! You may recall\'One Day\'was the official song of this year\'s Winter Olympics, and a great song it is! According to our sources, the show is nearly sold out, and the show will be airing live to 17 different cities in Hillels and JCCs across the country. PS22 will also be hosting a visit from Matis to rehearse (a la our unforgettable Celtic Woman collaboration ), so this should prove to be yet another rewarding week for our blog followers! To follow the PS22 Chorus blog and be alerted to all the new goings-on and music, click here . PS22 Chorus member Fiona wrote this sweet and somber song she ironically calls\'Friendship .\'I found it very touching when she sang it for me, and decided to work with her to arrange it for the full chorus. Here is the beautiful result. Congratulations to Fiona for her superb song and performance here in the video. Already internet fans are comparing her to a young Avril Lavigne ! Love it!! We\'re so proud of you, Fiona!! What a great example you are to show how to turn painful emotions into something beautiful. UPDATE (3-13-10): CONGRATS TO FIONA!! She earned a YouTube Honor with her original song as the #68 Top Rated Music Video today!! Check out the screencap below! The PS22 Chorus of 2010 made the cover of CHORAL DIRECTOR MAGAZINE ! The magazine includes a very in-depth article/interview with writer Eliahu Sussman , and features some excellent photos from Claudio Papapietro . Unfortunately the on-line version doesn\'t include all the great photos of the kids that were used in the hard copy version, but the complete article is available on Choral Director Magazine\'s website . (The magazine was apparently published back in November, but it just came to my attention the other day!) Awesome to discover that PS22 Chorus of 2010 is currently being featured on the home page of Billboard.com on as their featured viral video! Below is a screen cap of their home page, and a cap to the link to the vid and short article praising the kids\' new version of\'Lisztomania\'by Phoenix ! The PS22 Chorus of 2010 is definitely causing quite a stir around the internet with its newest cover of\'Lisztomania\'by Phoenix . In a,\'ition to earning over 50,000 views on its weekend debut and being featured in top spots on Buzzfeed & Re,\'it , today the video has shown up on three noteworthy blogs from The Village Voice, Teen Vogue, & MTV Buzzworthy ! All have great things to say about the chorus\'s latest effort! Check out the screencaps below. And for more on\'Lisztomania,\'click here . The chorus just got another e-mailed message from Lynn Hillary of Celtic Woman , who visited the kids just last week . Dear Gregg and PS22, It\'s been almost a week since we met you and your incredible bunch of little superstars but we are all STILL talking about it all the time! I can\'t stress enough what an impression they made on us not just with their glorious voices and obvious love and dedication for the music they sing, but they were just such nice friendly kids!! I just know they will all go on to do great things in the world. Sometimes I forget what joy there is to be found in singing, and you all reminded me of that! Also your advice to the kids about\'if you FEEL the music you can never go wrong!\'is something I will always think about if I ever feel nervous! I\'ve been reading your amazing blog and really wanted to a,\' my thanks too (you don\'t have to post this up, I\'m sure you\'re running out of space! I just wanted to thank you again, I know it\'s all been said already but once more wouldn\'t hurt!!) I was on the meet and greet that night at Radio City and the people were amazed when I told them this was our first time performing with the children, they said it looked so natural, like it was really meant to be a part of the show all the time. If only you could be with us every night! Performing You Raise Me Up now feels strange without PS22, like there is something missing, but their voices always resonate inside my head as we sing, so in a way it feels like they are there all around us, sometimes I imagine that they are! I think this is an experience that will stay with me for a long long time. Thank you so much and please tell them that we really miss them and think about them a lot! I wish you and the children continued success and happiness, and we really hope to see you again soon (for more hugs..and sniffs!) I can\'t wait to see what you get up to next on your adventures...we\'ll be watching!! Peace and Love, Lynn
Well, that\'s it I\'m back in the real world having travelled back up through Africa and slowly made my way back to the Uk.My next task is to find myself a job. I also have to unpack my stuff and sort out my life. In the mean time there should be more time to do other things.I realise that there are a lot of missing holes in the blog and will make an effort to fill them in as soon as I can.Watch this space. Once again I have to say sorry for not updating the blog. I don\'t have any great excuses except to say that I have been very very busy. So busy that the only time that I have time to write an entry happens to be relief which is theoretically the busiest time down here at Halley. So here is a text entry of the past the present and the future. Hopefully I will get around to filling this in a bit more.So in short what has been happening? Well since my last entry I have been on my final winter trip and got some amazing photos (soon to be a,\'ed). New people arrived on base and we had our first plane. I finally got down to see the penguins at Windy bay. Apart from that its been packing packing and more packing as we shut down the science here to make space for the building of the new base. The science team has packed over 5 tonnes already and I will be packing another tonne and a half before the end of relief. All this will be sent back to Cambridge or in the case of the AIS (which I looked after) Norway. Oh yeah my leg is fine, thanks for all the support. I have even been kiting
I\'m pretty excited about this. Leave it to HBS to come up with the MBA Oath. Money quote (emphasis a,\'ed):\'One of Jeff Skilling\'s classmates has recalled a comment the ex-CEO of Enron made during a class about a dangerous consumer product:\'I\'d keep making and selling [it]. My job as a business man is to...maximize return to the shareholders. It\'s the government\'s job to step in if a product is dangerous.\'As a student today at Harvard\'s business school, I hear echoes of those comments from my classmates .\'Yikes. The author goes on:\'In their reverence for the individual, business schools are remarkably bad at creating a sense of common purpose beyond an ambition to make money. Without a higher calling, bad actors flourish and those who want to speak out against them have little basis on which to challenge them.\'With much love to my HBS chums, this is not the way things are at all top business schools. And honestly, I can\'t imagine that (outside of a small, perhaps vocal element) that this isn\'t what it\'s really like at HBS either...is it? This is the second in a three part review of my favorite 10 shows of the decade that was. I\'ve figured out the last show to include, but I\'ll save that for another post so I don\'t drown everybody with words. 5/05 Shins in OKC—A very nice show (Shins sound live exactly like they do on record) that was nicer because I was there enjoying it with Lauren. We hadn\'t been dating that long at that point, and we drove up with our friends Bill and Rick. We all made it back to Ft Sill the next day to attend my Hail and Farewell from the Army. I was allowed a speech, and as many know I enjoy (a bit too much) any chance to be on the microphone. My speech that day concluded with: \'Peace in the mi,\'le east, no blood for oil, I\'m out!\' and made a lot of people mad. It also caused one of my fellow officers, a 6 foot 5, 280 lbs black guy, to tell me that I was \'one funky Caucasian\'. Good times. Lauren and I wrapped up the weekend with a going away party at Rick\'s place. Great weekend, and the Shins were a big part of it. 08/04 Wrens/Magnolia Electric Co in Denton—drove down by myself from Fort Sill to Denton, a city famous for death metal bands and being north of Dallas. I didn\'t know anyone so I chatted with either band before the show. Indie shows are cool like that (especially back in 01-05 before indie blew up). Both performances were strong, and it was great to see two of my faves on the same stage. After several beers at the show I slept in my car until the next morning and then drove the 4 hours home. 6/06 Radiohead in Berkeley—The perfect culmination to years of Radiohead hero worship. Memorable because of the beautiful Berkeley summer night, and time spent with friends David Hyman, the Rotblats, and Nate Anthony. If I never see Radiohead again it would be a shame, but I am very cool with this night being my lasting memory of the Radiohead experience. 4/05 Wilco in OKC (2)—Bill Rausch and a sportsjacket. I don\'t think I can legally say anything else about this show besides that. (Also, go see Wilco live. It\'s expensive to do, nowadays, but it\'s worth it.) In no order whatsoever, here is the first half of my live music retrospective on the decade that was. Part 2 will run later in the week. These aren\'t necessarily the 10 best shows I saw, but for one reason or another they were the 10 most memorable. (Editors Note—part 2 currently only has 4 shows. If you attended a really memorable show with me in the last 10 years that didn\'t make it in this post, please send me some inspiration!!!) 5/03 Built to Spill in LA—I\'ve seen these guys more than any other band, and one show had to go on the list. This was easily the best show I\'ve seen them play. They closed with a 15 minute version of Cortez the Killer during which Jim Roth did things with his guitar the likes of which I\'ve never seen before or since. Epic. I have a poster of this show on the wall of my apartment. 4/06 Daft Punk at Coachella—I was there with several great friends Berkeley friends, to include the Kaplans and Anna Utgoff. DP wasn\'t why I went to this festival, but it\'s the one thing I\'ll never forget about Coachella. This was the first show DP did with their giant laser pyramid (top left). It was as cool as everyone says it was. 12/05 Wrens in SF—I love the Wrens, and they\'re always great live. I had seen them maybe 6 months earlier at the Pitchfork Intonation Music Festival in Chicago. At that show, for one song, they brought fans up on stage to play percussion with the band. When that song came up at this show I left my friends (Dan and Kelly) and pushed to the very front. I had a Bruce Springsteen/Courtney Cox moment with a member of the band, and he pulled me on stage with several fellow fans. When the singing came in I did what I do at shows—sang along. The band member, seeing I knew the words and wasn\'t a completely awful singer pulled me into the mic so I could sing along with the band. We did it up, back-to-back 80s hair metal style, for the rest of the song. It was probably the coolest moment I\'ve ever had at a concert, hands down. 3/06 Magnolia Electric Co/Okkervil River in Austin—At SXSW I won an MBA music case competition with Any, April Chris and Sung Hu. We had no passes (the guys at McCombs let us down) but a couple of us managed to hop the fence at this outdoor set and enjoy two really nice performances. 9/06 Silver Jews in SF—This was a good but unspectactular show on September 10th 2006. I went by myself and had made plans to try to meet up with David H, but he got held up doing other stuff. The show was memorable because I got my letter in the mail from Uncle Sam the next day calling me back to the Army. I saw a few other good shows before I cut myself off from music in 2007 to go overseas (Islands and Phoenix in SF come immediately to mind) but music wasn\'t quite the same for me after this show, not for a long while at least. Once upon a time I loved making music lists. Really, really loved it. The problem was that my list skills never quite caught up with my enthusiasm for making them. For example: I spent an entire summer in 2003 trying to come up with a mix CD worth of songs that featured hand clapping. Sounds simple enough, right? But the project never really came together. In my mind, the songs had to be good, satisfactorily indie and/or ironic, and non-obvious enough that I would feel good (and snobby) about attaching my name to the list (so no \'Theme from Friends\', etc). The whole thing started when I was driving around Alaska listening to \'Nothing\'severgonnastandinmywayagain\' by Wilco, a song I loved (still do) so much that I would take my hands off of the wheel to clap along with the chorus. Same deal for \'Alone Down There\' by Modest Mouse and Ted Leo\'s \'Timorous Me\'. But those three songs ended up as the list. When I couldn\'t think of any other songs that really got me excited I brought Megan and her brother Jeff into the conversation, and they had great suggestions that for whatever reason still didn\'t quite make me happy. The final analysis: good idea, poor execution. In business school and in Seattle (when I was with Amazon) I made a lot of live music lists in an effort to get people to come to shows with me. It was fun, but didn\'t work that well either (I went to a lot of shows solo). Putting all that aside, I want to start 2010 with a few music lists for old time\'s sake. In a couple of days I\'ll lay out my favorite live music experience of the last 10 years, but tonight I\'m going to rank where music fits in with all the other crap going in Exnicios-land circa 2000-2009. We\'ll call my parents emeritus to this list and not in the official running. Without further ado: 1. Lauren (my beautiful wife) 2. Graduating Duke (and all that went along with it) 3a. Going to war (even if I wasn\'t getting shot at) 3b. Being in the Army generally (I\'m better at push ups and shooting things than I would have been) 5. Graduating from Berkeley (and all that went along with it) 6. Calhoun and Bailey (my dog and cat) 7. Music (only top 7...music\'s got to feel a little disappointed) 8. All of my other friends and family not captured by Duke, Army, Berkeley, etc. 9. The Washington Redskins (0-1 in the new decade!) 10. All the books I read This is a test.

That means it\'s been more than a year since I got home and picked up again with my life with Lauren. In the last 14 months (Nov 2008 until now) we got a dog, had a re-we,\'ing and went to New Zealand. I started working as a consultant at Booz Allen Hamilton in March, but not until after I got to say that I was unemployed during the great economic meltdown. All told Lauren and I celebrated 7 other we,\'ings with family and friends (very fun) and had to say goodbye to one of the best guys either of us had ever met (very, very sad). Lauren and I live in Old Town Alexandria, about 5 or 6 miles outside of DC proper. We both work in the District and we\'ve settled into a really nice routine. I miss blogging. A lot. I think that I\'m not awful at this, and I wish I had been better about writing in 2009. But for some reason it\'s been hard for me to look at Army 2.0 for the last year. I don\'t know why. In general I\'ve had trouble engaging technology. Technology was my entire focus for 2 years at Haas, and I stayed pretty well connected to that world while I was in Afghanistan of all places. Home in DC, I feel more detached from the West Coast than I ever did in the war zone. Weird, I know. Life is great all the same. Lauren and I are really happy. And we\'re going to figure the Coast thing soon (by which I mean before Lauren divorces me for indecision). So in conjunction with that decision, here is my 2010 to-do list: 1) Re-engage technology—spend less time reading about NBA teams I don\'t care about and more time reading tech blogs 2) Blog a couple of times a week—I appreciate that anything I say now is less interesting than anything I said while on the forward edge of freedom, but still. Writing is fun. 3) For the first time, really embrace Facebook and Twitter—read above poor, innocent social networking sites have suffered for the same reason my blog has. I am safely home with my family in Northern Virginia. As far as I know I have no further obligation to the Army for the next 6 months, and after that I\'ll be eligible to resign my commission. Sultan Jeff is home as well, but Chris is still over in Afghanistan. He was the last of my group to arrive, and he\'ll be the last to come home. Thank you for all of your thoughts, prayers, and well wishes (and clicks and eyeballs and links) over the last 16 months. The blog is not going to go away. We still have VPs to settle on, and the IRR story is something that will continue to develop as we see what direction the wars take under a new president. Thanks again, and I\'ll talk to everyone soon.

Many top brands are available regionally and in scarce supply. Therefore, to the casual consumer (most consumers) the choice of a wine is overwhelming. This makes the packaging extremely important. On a rack of 10 Chilean Syrah\'s you\'ve never heard of before the only information you have to work with are packaging and price. There are essentially no features and benefits. You make a snap decision and hope for the best. This list shows 25 brilliant wine bottle designs that no doubt grab the buyers attention and boost sales. B.C. is home to many great wines which don\'t often make lists like the one above because of their limited distribution. A great example is Blasted Church Vineyards which feature unique labels by artist Monika Melnychuk which get people\'s attention. The wine is pretty good too so people some back for more. This Guitar Shop in Southampton, England made the most of the security barrier that covers the store front when they are closed. For their efforts they now have worldwide exposure thanks to the good old world wide web (not just on my blog).

I was first exposed to Ex Number Five via the clunky yet harmless Razor Freestyle Scooter video game. Yeah, remember those Razor scooters? Every kid on the block had one back then. Despite not having anything in common whatsoever, the band gained a decent amount of public appeal from that game, and for good cause. They meant business when it came to their craft and musicianship, even down to perfecting the post-hardcore act; twin guitars lash out monstrous, melodic riffs that interchange, harmonize and play off of each other in a way that pulses as the group\'s lead auxiliary. Alf Bartone fronts a unique and powerful voice that gives their songs an extra injection of steroids, yet he manages to keep away from standard screamo territory. Even drummer Luke Bodenstein proved to be a vital asset with his diverse patterns and intricate fills, dropping serious onslaughts that drive each song home. The band has had a couple different bassists, but Chris Newman certainly threw in a meaty low-end on their later recordings.Preceded by a number of demos, The Team Players Association can be considered Ex Number Five\'s true output of studio material. My only gripe with an otherwise solid rock album is it only includes nine tracks.\'(Not) Go\'was the best of the two songs featured on Razor Freestyle Scooter, yet is sorely missed on the record and would have been an excellent bookend for the band\'s short-lived run.
It\'s not every day you lose someone you spent twenty years in space with. That\'s Dan O\'Bannon I\'m glaring at in this scene from Dark Star. We were never close, even though we did share a very cozy control room on that space ship. Nevertheless, I was always impressed with his talents, which ran deep in a various directions. I remember reading an interview where he described watching an early screening of Dark Star in which the audience wasn\'t laughing. It upset him that they didn\'t realize it was a comedy so he set out to scare the crap out of them instead...and wrote Alien. That worked! I\'m obviously glad that Dark Star came to find cult status over time. Dan\'s name should always be mentioned in the same breath as John Carpenter when Dark Star is mentioned. I have no doubt that when I die Dan will be waiting to torment me with a rubber chicken once again. He was that kind of guy.
A driver\'s license gives you a certain level of freedom, but it also gives you an enormous amount of responsibility. When behind the wheel this responsibility comes in many forms : - Wearing seat belts - Driving sober - Focusing on the road - Driving defensively In Jan. 2009, NSC called for a nationwide ban on all cell phone use while driving. This comes after NSC researchers and statisticians reviewed more than 50 peer-reviewed research reports, many drawing the same conclusion. Drivers who use their cell phones have a significantly increased chance of getting into a car accident. MAKING OUR WORLD SAFER ...

You just can\'t tell anyone the rush you feel behind the handle bars of a Yamaha Nuevo...Anyone who has been to Asia knows that without a moto, you can\'t get around. Motorbikes, motorcycles, mopeds outnumber cars on the roads of Bali, Cambodia, Thailand, and Laos.

We hit Calcutta downtro,\'en, exhauseted emotionally and physically, we were limping to the finish line...The journey from Nepal to Bodhgaya and then on to Calcutta had been arduous to say the least. We were almost stranded in Bodhgaya and could not take a rickshaw as we were told they were too dangerous at night and we would be robbed. The area is very unsafe and full of bandits and we only made our train by paying a local a relatively exhorbitant amount of money to drive us to the train station. When we arrived to Calcutta\'s dingey traveller\'s area we were in bad shape but needed to stick it out to finish buying our instruments. We spent a hot day searching through the various music stores and came away with a very nice set of tablas. CLICK HERE or on the image to download slideshow.

It was a tough 4 days as you can read in the entry below, but we made it, even though we had doubts that we would at several times during the journey. When we arrived at this oasis, we were greeted by the sight of monks from all over the world dressed in white, safron, yellow, and red robes chanting and doing prostrations (bowing up and down many times). One cannot but help to feel the profound energy and importance that emanates from this sight, where thousands of monks have been meditating for thousands of years. Upon arrival we circled the grounds which contain many Bodhi trees, temples, and stupas, found a comfortable spot under the same tree as Bu,\'ha reached enlightenment and tried to do the same... CLICK HERE or on the image to view slideshow. We left Kathmandu 4 days ago thinking it would take 2 to reach Bodhgaya, India. We could not have predicted what lay in store for us though. Our pilgrimage started out with optimistm and energy but ended with frustration and freyed nerves. Bodhgaya is home of the Bohdi tree which Sidartha Guatama, or Bu,\'ha, reached enlightenment under. Until, we began researching our trip, I did not know that you could visit the actual tree, I thought it was just a myth or a story, but there is an actual tree. Unfortunately, to get to Bohdgaya, we had to go through hell. The roughest part of our trip up until this point was going from India to Nepal, but from Nepal into Bihar, India was surpassed it. Never was the difference between Nepal and India so evident. Literally, after crossing the border, the vibe of our trip changed, the tone of the people changed...we were thrown back into fending away desperate people who were intent on selling us something or stealing what we had. I cannot judge these people because they are so poor, I do not know what I would do in their situation... Malcolm has been very ill with Giardia, and we have been stuck on dirty trains, horse drawn carts, auto and bicycle rickshaws who have been anything but honest. The 2 hour bus ride from Muzamphur to Patna was by far the worst of the trip. We had to literally fight people to get a seat, and when we did sit down we were wedged in by people nad luggage. If the bus would have flipped we would have been done. The foul air, thick from chemicals from plastic waste bonfires wafted in throughh the windows and gave us headaches. In Patna, we could not find a guesthouse to sleep in, apparently because we were foreigners. We finally found a place that catered to tourists and we had to pay the most for lodging that we have so far. Upon collapsing on the bed we were excited to order food asw we had not eaten all day. Unfortunatley, the yogurt in the Lassi drink I ordered was off and I began throwing up in the toilet. The hotel staff would not give us our money back and the hot water which should be standard in a hotel of this price did not work. We left the next morning and made the final leg of the journey to Bodhgaya by bus and by rickshaw. Bodhgaya, is located in the state of Bijar, by far the most dangerous, poor, and lawless region of India. You must watch your back at all times and unfortunately, Bu,\'ha\'s prophecy that the area would be forever plagued by famine, poverty, and war has been true. It is ironic that the holiest of all Bu,\'hist sites is in the mi,\'le of such a place. At this point we are feeling that we are enduring India rather than enjoying it. However, we have been looking forward to reaching Bodhgaya and the Bohdi tree and are looking forward to meditating under it and soaking up the ambience.
I have no interest whatsoever in defending the latest round of ridiculous buck-passing going on in the House. The idea, apparently, is that they\'re going to pass the raft of fixes to the health care bill and simply \'deem\' the Senate bill passed. Somehow this is supposed to reduce process-based attacks from the Republicans. The mind boggles. Sometimes you wonder how the Democratic Party hasn\'t self-immolated yet. We\'re talking about an absolute core principle of the party. If you aren\'t interested in trying to get millions of more people some basic health care than what exactly are you doing in the party anyway? And if, even worse, you\'re Dennis Kucinich, how can you sleep at night knowing how much good this bill would do but still opposing it because it doesn\'t achieve the purity of alien-inspired dreams? But now we\'re facing the possibility that living, breathing people who were capable of getting themselves elected to the House of Representatives in the most powerful country the world has ever seen are simultaneously so stupid that they think this legislative rigmarole is going to help them. While I\'ve stated repeatedly that all the fuss about the \'Cornhusker kickback\' and such things is mostly an illusion generated by the process, apparently House Democrats are absolutely terrified of it. So terrified that they\'re not even willing to go on record as having voted for the bill that contains it. Despite the fact that they\'re going to turn around and IMMEDIATELY vote for another bill that removes it. A bill, by the way, that will be immensely popular and create a serious bind for the Republicans. Because if they just do this the old-fashioned way, the initial vote to pass the Senate bill makes health care the law of the land. They pass it and Obama signs it and it\'s LAW. At that point, the Republicans in Congress are going to be faced with a seriously deadly choice. They can continue to go nuts and vote against everything health care related--but that will put them on record as attempting to SUSTAIN the \'Cornhusker kickback\' and the \'Big Apple buyout\' and the \'Sooner snicker-doodles\' or whatever. Or, they can vote for the patch and seriously undermine their\'health care is going to pay for Rahm Emanuel to kill your grandmother in a big field of corn\'message. Since they will have voted for a bipartisan fix to it. But no, the Democrats want to get all fancy now, and adopt a mechanism that is questionably constitutional and stupid on the merits . The whole Democratic establishment has drawn battle lines now . Obama, the House leadership, the Senate leadership, unions, everyone. They\'re all making it clear that this needs to pass and that they\'re willing to completely withdraw electoral support for people who don\'t join in - even to the point of funding primary opponents. And good for them. Even if it wasn\'t politically smart (which it is), there are some moments when you just have to do what is right and let the chips fall where they may. I don\'t often like what Will Saletan has to say, but his recent piece on this is spot-on: Maybe passing the health care bill will bring on a Republican tsunami. Maybe it will create a generation of Democrats who revere Obama the way their great-grandparents revered FDR. Maybe you\'ll be back in Congress next year. Maybe you won\'t. Either way, this is too big a vote to cast on the basis of politics. Every so often, a bill comes along that\'s bigger than anything your predecessor got to touch. You\'re the lucky bastard who had your seat in 2010, when that bill reached the floor. And here you are, worrying about your career, when the purpose of your career is staring you in the face. It\'s time to just pass the damn bill already. If Congress wasn\'t full of egotistical maniacs who wanted to get everything juuuuust right this would have passed three or four months ago. Or in January. Or February. But better late than never. Just pass the damn thing and demonstrate that you\'re not total goobers. Begging to Bleed - Foundation The reason I like this song is that it really reminds me of\'Let My Love Open the Door,\'except with a folksy style that reminds me a lot of the Billy Bragg/Wilco project. If that sounds appealing to you, then you\'ll probably like this one a lot. If not, well, I warned you. The album is called Chimborazo , and it came out last year. Are House Republicans really going to try to run ads accusing the Democrats of voting for unpopular parts of the Senate bill like the ‘Cornhusker Kickback\'? Really? I know political attention spans are often as short as goldfish, but surely the counter-ad \'I voted for a bill to ensure that the Cornhusker kickback was removed, while my opponent voted AGAINST that bill\' would be pretty damning. Unless the Republicans are planning on voting for the patch   and thus completely ruining their \'Obama = health care = teh socialism = ZOMGs\' message? Okay, so they\'re not reuniting. But they ARE playing a show together in July. And (for all the people who have lamented being unable to actually obtain their music after hearing me rave about them), they\'re re-releasing their albums through my new favorite record label, Hardly Art . In a,\'ition, they\'ve got a compilation coming out on July 13, called They\'ll Only Miss You When You Leave: Songs 1996   2003. My only complaint on that front is that it\'s got only a couple tracks from Ugly But Honest (my #1 album of the past decade ). But when there\'s so much great stuff to choose from, you can\'t really get it wrong. Track list for the compilation record: 1. Low Budget Slow Motion Soundtrack Song For the Leaving Scene 2. Die 3. The Color That Your Eyes Changed With the Color of Your Hair 4. One Night Stand 5. You Should Be Hated Here 6. Drunk with the Only Saints I Know 7. Phantom Fireworks 8. So You Wanna Be A Superhero 9. Brooke Daniels\' Tiny Broken Fingers 10. Ignorant Piece of Shit 11. Blessed Arms That Hold You Tight, Freezing Cold and Alone 12. Blue Champagne Glass 13. September Come Take This Heart Away 14. All Apologies and Smiles, Yours Truly, Ugly Valentine 15. Sympathy Bush 16. They\'ll Only Miss You When You Leave Jonathan Chait is weirdly puzzled over the lyrics to\'You\'re So Vain\'by Carly Simon (which is not about David Geffen , despite what you may have heard). Chait says:\'[N]othing about the song makes any sense. She\'s giving an extremely detailed description of a former lover, but insisting that his being able to recognize the description is evidence of vanity.\'But that\'s why it\'s clever! The whole point of the song is that the person is vain, smug, self-satisfied, thinks the world revolves around himself...and is wholly justified in thinking so. At least in respect to the narrator. The song IS about him, after all. It works in the same way that a great\'I\'m SOOOO over you\'song works. If you were really over them, you wouldn\'t have to write a song about it. And if she wasn\'t obsessed with him, then his vanity wouldn\'t be a problem. Right? And then there\'s a whole a,\'itional layer, which is that she has played the vagueness of the subject matter into a multiple-decade-long mystery. So obviously the specific stuff is meant to be true in spirit but not literally correct. The result being: there are quite a few people who might think the song is about them - and by doing so it BECOMES a song about them. Get it? Anyways, it\'s more fun to not know than it ever would be to get an answer. Puppets - Jose Vanders The puzzlingly named Jose Vanders (as in, she\'s a she) is embe,\'ed firmly in the grand tradition of waif-voiced folksy women playing sweet songs about love and life and growing up. Think of a young Regina Spektor with a bit of the Kate Nash snark. I realize that for some people that might not sound like an endorsement - in which case you\'re probably better off just passing through. But for those who like a little bit of sweetness in their lives, give this one a listen. In a,\'ition to being simple, pure, serene...it\'s also a lot of fun. The general theme (\'I\'m a puppet for you\') doesn\'t feel overdone, and the clapping (following the line\'I\'ve got strings tied to my fingers, pull them down, and I\'ll clap for you\') is amusing without treading into being precious.\'Puppets\'is from an EP called Red, Black, Blue, and the Tortoise , which came out a couple years ago. Fit - Windmill (from Pu,\'le City Racing Lights ) Perfect Fit - Laurel Music (from This Night and the Next ) So I\'m thinking about buying a new car. This is a pretty major deal since I\'ve been driving the same Dodge Caravan for about 12 years now. And while I love the old minivan, the recognition of rising gas prices and the initial investment required to buy a car designed for a family leads me to believe I really ought to buy a nice little fuel-efficient car. I think I\'ve settled on the Honda Fit. It gets great reviews, good gas mileage, is among the cheaper options out there, and apparently has the coolest folding back seat in the world which actually produces some reasonably good storage space for a small car. The question I have for you, gentle blog-readers, is this: do you have any experience, positive or negative, with the Fit? Is it a good choice? Should I be considering something else? I\'ve written about Slapstick a few times before - and it seems strange to keep coming back to a band that\'s been defunct for a decade at this point. But still, I just can\'t say no. The excuse this time is my discovery of some tracks from them that had completely slipped under my radar. Way back in the day I picked up their Slapstick CD, which I believed to be a complete collection of their released material. Turns out there\'s some other stuff floating around, including this track, which embodies everything there is to love about the band: I Hate Girls - Slapstick Like a cold gust of Chicago wind reaching us all the way from some dark club in the 90s filled with snotty ska-punk of the very best sort. A dirty guitar riff, horns that rise out and above, lyrics about lusting after a girl at a Jawbreaker show, and that absolutely glorious\'la la, la la la la la\'chorus. What\'s not to like?
As another cross blog venture, my good pals at The Philosophy of Time Travel and LastBestAngryMan have invited me to participate in a number of top 5 lists as this decade draws to a close. We have very different musical tastes in terms of our favorite stuff, but I also think we all are willing to listen to a lot of different stuff so there is some crossover. Lists like this are by their very nature completely subjective, but the point has always been to simply tell everybody they are wrong about everything. 5) Kid A by Radiohead This album represents for me the height of Radiohead\'s greatness - better than everything that came before and much better than everything that has come since. They take their first steps here into really stretching into experimentation but still keep some pop hooks, and the result is just tremendous. Everybody knows at least one or two songs by Radiohead just from osmosis, but what is interesting is that all these years later, you still have a chance of hearing something from The Bends or OK Computer on your radio but very little chance of hearing anything from this album which surely must be their best. 4) Yankee Hotel Foxtrot by Wilco This album is for Wilco what the Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock must have been like for T.S. Eliot: once you produce something this good, how can you live up to it again? Keeping with that analogy, we still haven\'t seen Wilco\'s equivalent of The Waste Land . They are still making great music (and I just saw them in concert this year incidentally), but they\'ve never been able to replicate the heights of fancy and genius they hit with this album early in the decade. That\'s not a knock against the band as few have ever hit heights like this. From the very beginning lyrics:\'I am an American Aquarium drinker\'you know you are going to get something a little bit different - but through it all it remains a coherent, sometimes heartbreaking but ultimately hopeful work that stands as something to be listened to from beginning to end. 3) Good Apollo, I\'m Burning Star IV, Vol 1: From Fear Through the Eyes of Madness by Coheed and Cambria Rock Band was basically the greatest thing to happen to these guys in terms of popularity as the fantastic track\'Welcome Home\'from this particular album is featured in the game, and was also featured in the preview for the movie\'9\'. But more than just that particular single, this is the 3rd album in a series of 4 that comprise an entire sci-fi rock opera by the group, telling a singular tale that, while often clumsy/impenetrable in terms of narrative, serves to tie the whole project together in a single thread. This 3rd volume is in my opinion the strongest with so many great tunes that stand alone, but in particular\'Ten Speed (Of God\'s Blood and Burial)\'and\'Apollo I: The Writing Writer\'rise to such bizarre heights of creativity in subject matter while at the same time keeping coherent metal hooks - it\'s just brilliant stuff all around. All 4 albums are terrific, but this one for me is the best of the project. 2) Takk.. by Sigur Ros Sigur Ros stands alone in their own category of music making right now for me insofar as I firmly believe they are the most important band out there today. You could argue there are other bands that are better but the reason Sigur Ros is so essential is they are in the unique position of being legitimately popular . How this, by pop standards, weird group from Iceland became pop icons is completely lost on me but I\'m totally okay with it because it really shows that all is not lost - people WILL listen to truly great music given the opportunity. If you had told me when Agaetis Byrjun was released that\'Svefn-g-englar\'would feature prominently on an episode of the TV show\'\',v I would\'ve told you that was patently absurd. It was very difficult to choose between this album and () (also called\'Two Sausages Kissing\'in jest) only because () was probably more important for the band\'s development, but I\'ve listened to Takk.. too many times not to make this the album I choose. I remember hearing Glosoli for the first time when I saw the band in concert - they were touring just before the release of Takk.. - and having my mind utterly blown. When I think of the Platonic model of\'hope\', I think of that song. 1) Lateralus by Tool This is bar none my favorite band, and this is my favorite album by that band. I get it that Tool isn\'t for everybody (just people who know what they\'re talking about), but it is tough to find a musician anywhere who won\'t at least admit that these guys are all absolutely ridiculous when it comes to the technical talent on display at every instrument in this band. Perfect Circle is a nice project for Maynard and I enjoy them, but this is where Maynard\'s home is, and this is where he does his best work. It\'s amazing that this album came out in 2001 and nothing has come out that has been better, including Tool\'s own 10,000 Days which, while awesome, didn\'t quite hit the level of Lateralus simply because track for track there are absolutely no weaknesses on Lateralus. Perhaps the way I can most easily sum up the level of this band is to relay this story: after seeing this band in concert with one of my friends who is a musician, he simply turned to me and said\'Well, that was intimidating.\'Indeed. Some context for below - tonight the local minor league team, the Wilmington Blue Rocks , are having\'Cowboy Monkey Rodeo Night\', which involves monkeys dressed as cowboys riding on dogs. This led to the chat below with a good friend: me: tonight is awesome &nbsp;&nbsp;Cowboy Monkey Rodeo night + fireworks &nbsp;&nbsp;Monkeys in cowboy outfits riding dogs Friend: shouldn;t they be called Dogboy Monkies? me: Cowboy Monkey will lasso you good for suggesting this &nbsp;&nbsp;they don\'t round up dogs &nbsp;&nbsp;they ride them Friend: yeah true &nbsp;&nbsp;what do they round up? Squirrels? &nbsp;&nbsp;COWS??? me: what they round up are good times &nbsp;&nbsp;Goodtimeboy Monkeys Friend: now that would be illegal - making monkeys round up squirrels while riding dogs &nbsp;&nbsp;then - you feed the losing team to a shark &nbsp;&nbsp;THAT\'S good times me: I don\'t want to live in a country where you can\'t watch monkeys dressed as cowboys riding dogs herding squirrels tossing them to sharks &nbsp;&nbsp;and you can quote me on that One of the many things that makes baseball the greatest sport in the world is that it represents stability - every March, players start training for April. Every April, thousands of fans show up for Opening Day at their respective ballparks, filled with the hope of possibility - even if their team is predicted to lose 100 games this year, it hasn\'t happened yet: everybody starts 0-0. As the oft maligned former commissioner Bart Giamatti said: It breaks your heart. It is designed to break your heart. The game begins in the spring, when everything else begins again, and it blossoms in the summer, filling the afternoons and evenings, and then as soon as the chill rains come, it stops and leaves you to face the fall alone. In other words, it appeals because there is so little about the game that ever changes. It is as familiar as the spring, as familiar as the sun rising and setting. When Harry Kalas died yesterday, it surprised me that it hurt. It didn\'t seem to me at first like I had any right to really be affected: after all, I didn\'t know Harry personally. I never met the man. I was just a Phillies fan, one that probably took him for granted too often like many others, so used to him calling the games that it didn\'t even cross my mind that someday, he wouldn\'t be around to do it. Harry called every Phillies game of my entire life - his presence was as ubiquitous as the Phillies themselves, as baseball itself. I stare out the window at what is a gloomy day here in Delaware, and I know the spring will come. I know that everyone will eventually move on, myself included, because baseball, like life, goes on. But for right now, for this moment, Harry is gone, and with him the spring and the promise that both it and baseball bring. The promise they represent - that there are windows of opportunity in life where anything seems possible - for now seems to have disappeared. The feeling will pass, as all things do, and no matter how much we might want things to stay the same, no matter how much we might want to turn on the game tomorrow night and hear Harry call it, comforted by the familiarity of it all, it won\'t happen. We learn to adjust. Baseball represents that too, you know: the game may not change, but the people do. It\'s not a bad thing or a good thing, it just is. Right now though, I just want it to feel like spring, the way it did on Sunday when the Phillies won and Harry called the game, and everything was exactly as I thought it should be on an afternoon in April - and now can\'t ever be precisely the same again. I absolutely love movies, but I dislike going to the movie theater . In the past 2 years I\'ve seen maybe a half dozen movies in the theater, and very rarely will I go on a busy movie day (like a Friday night) if I go at all. I like a nice Sunday matinee, but really with TVs and DVD players being what they are, with all of the easy access we have to movies via Netflix, movie channels, TiVo, Netflix on TiVo, etc. it just seems kind of silly sometimes to go to a movie theater when I (personally) can be guaranteed to enjoy the experience at home. Going to the movie theater is not a sure good time, mostly because of the occasional rudeness of other movie-goers. But sometimes you just can\'t avoid the hype and you find yourself unwilling to wait for the DVD release. My bu,\'ies at LastBestAngryMan and The Philosophy of Time Travel agreed we would all post our top 5 most anticipated films of 2009. Here\'s the top 5 movies I\'m most likely to see in the theater in 2009, which by proxy means they are the most anticipated: 5) 9 - This film will mark the real feature film directing debut for Shane Acker , who really cut his teeth doing animation with Weta during the Lord of the Rings films. Here\'s the deal with this one - Acker made a 10 minute or so short film around the concept a few years ago. The movie is embe,\'ed below. The film coming out in theaters this year is the whole story. The visual style is super cool and I\'m always a fan of animation in all its incarnations. Short film\'9\': Feature Film Trailer, featuring a terrific song by Coheed and Cambria : 4) The Lovely Bones - There are two big reasons I\'m looking forward to seeing this. Number one, the book is absolutely terrific and for me exceeded the critical hype. Number two, Peter Jackson is directing, and the material from the book is something I think he could prepare a feast with. No trailer available yet. 3) The Wrestler - This movie is technically out right now in the US but only under limited release. I check every weekend to see if it is out around Delaware but so far no luck. The number one reason I want to see this: I haven\'t seen a Darren Aronofsky movie yet that I haven\'t loved. I also have a soft spot in my heart for the material here because when I was a kid I was a huge fan of pro wrestling. There\'s a lot of Oscar talk swirling around Mickey Rourke\'s performance in this one, if that kind of stuff matters to you. 2) Public Enemies - It\'s a 1930s crime drama starring Christian Bale and Johnny Depp directed by Michael Mann. If you need any more explanation than that I have no idea what to tell you. 1) Watchmen - I\'m worried about this movie. Really, really worried. There is a very good reason that Watchmen is the only graphic novel on Time\'s 100 greatest novels list: it is an absolute masterpiece. It is also really, really complex and has always seemed like it would be a nightmare to faithfully translate to the big screen. We already know that at least one key element (the Tales of the Black Freighter framing device) will not be in the movie. There are more and more reports suggesting that the ending has been changed. The director\'s original 3 hour cut was apparently loathed by the studio and who knows if it will survive tampering. The whole thing is a recipe for a colossal disaster. But I had a lot of the same skepticism with Lord of the Rings , and boy was I completely wrong there. This easily gets #1 because it is probably the only movie I will definitely see this year in the theater, and that\'s because there\'s no way I\'ll be able to avoid it. A great deal of my friends love the graphic novel as much as I do, and I\'ll be unable to avoid discussions of this movie when it is finally out. Hopefully they will be discussions about how we were totally wrong about all our concerns over the movie. You don\'t need to know the ins and outs of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to know that it\'s bad. In fact, it has been so bad for so long that whenever another bombing or act of terrorism is reported, it just seems to roll like water off a duck\'s back for most folks. It says something when a story of cooperation is more unexpected and surprising than a story of people blowing each other up. It says something sad about the way things are there. But it also says something awe inspiring at just how far some people will go to try to change things, even on the tiniest of levels. ------- When you say\'football\', people from different parts of the world will think of different things. Most, of course, will think of what we call in America\'soccer\'. In Australia though, they think of their own variation of\'rugby\'- Australian rules football. In 2002, Australia hosted the first ever Australian Football International Cup . The idea was to promote interest in the sport in other countries by hosting a tournament that Australia itself would not participate in. It\'s the kind of thing I can\'t imagine America bothering to host - we\'d want to win our own tournament, after all. But since Australia has the only professional league for their unique sport, it made sense to sit out this tournament because winning was almost guaranteed. Why not give other teams playing their sport in other countries a chance to compete and measure their talents? The tournament was enough of a success that it was hosted again in 2005, and now it will happen a third time here in 2008. This year 16 teams from around the world will compete for the trophy, the most since the tournament started. When you look at the list of teams competing , one jumps out at you: Peace Team . A strange name for a side participating in a rough and tumble game. ------- In January of 2008, Australian football legend Robert\'Dipper\'Dipierdomenico, along with some other league representatives, presented the rules of the game to a room full of 100 young men. Out of that 100, 40 were selected to participate in a 3 day clinic to learn the basics of the game. The unusual part of the story: these young men were a mix of Israelis and Palestinians, and the clinic was in Jerusalem. Perhaps crazy enough was the idea of getting a team of men completely unfamiliar with the sport ready to compete internationally in just under 8 months. But even crazier was the idea of trying to do it here, with these men. The team faced complications trying to train that would be completely unheard of elsewhere. The coach\'s instructions needed to be translated to both Hebrew and Arabic. The team was shut out of their Israeli training facility for 4 days during a visit by President Bush when all Palestinians were denied access, including Palestinian members of the team. Team members received threats from both sides of the conflict, either enduring the usual hate from one side or being called\'traitor\'by the other. Palestinian team members needed to obtain work permits for every training session, sometimes traveling upwards of 4 hours through various security checkpoints. The pressure was too much for a number of the players. Some of them, facing threats from their own friends and neighbors, left the team. In spite of all of this, a few kept practicing. A few kept playing. In spite of the lack of a proper field (they played on soccer fields) with proper goalposts (they had none), they kept learning. The first time the team had seen real goal posts was when they arrived in Australia a week ago. They play their first match of the tournament today against Great Britain. ------- New Zealand and Ireland will be the favorites going into the tournament. The Peace Team will probably be lucky to win a single match. But win or lose, they will do it together .\'Everyone knows the story in Israel and Palestine, the occupation, the killings, bombings, we came here to show the people, we came for the peace, we need the peace,\'says Palestinian ruckman Fares Switte. In January, it\'s not likely Fares Switte knew what a ruckman was. But then again, in January, the whole notion of a team like this was pretty unlikely too. ------- After the tournament is over, the players on the Peace Team will return to their normal lives. They will return to face the same strife and conflict they faced before they started playing together. They might even return to find themselves reviled in their own homes. But they\'ll return changed in this small way, knowing this simple thing: if we can play together, we can live together. ------- Note: For a tremendous introduction to the various factions and pieces in play in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, I can\'t recommend the game Peacemaker enough. It is easily the most engaging introduction I\'ve ever seen, better even than any book I have read on the topic. And yes, it has a Mac version. It\'s an ever shrinking world. On the one hand it means we tend to fight a little more over resources that we all need. On the other hand, it means we have a better opportunity than ever to learn to live with each other. I\'m a big fan of the Olympics. I\'m talking about an event where we get to see sports that we probably won\'t see for another 4 years, but with a built in rooting interest. We root for our country. We root for the human interest stories. We root for the ideal that we can all, just maybe, get along for a couple weeks. Of course the ideal is not reality. The Olympics are bringing some of China\'s questionable government practices out into the world spotlight. The games are sometimes overshadowed by stories of the conflict in Georgia. In spite of these things, sport goes on. The beauty of sport as a fan is that, for the duration of the match, game, whatever, you aren\'t thinking about those things. It is not a good idea to ignore what goes on in this world. But it\'s not a bad thing to set it aside once in awhile. ----- Imagine you\'ve got a tumor in your belly growing so large that it begins to push all of your internal organs, liver, intestine, kidneys... all to the sides of your body. Imagine that the hospital that is trying to treat you has just been taken over by a group that is likely to kill you if they see you. Imagine that it doesn\'t matter anyway, since the doctors have told you there is nothing they can do to save you. Imagine you are two years old. This boy exists, and he lives in Iraq, the child of a Sunni family whose hospital had been taken over by Shiite militia. On the other side of the world, in Boston, someone hears of this, a wealthy, 85 year old liquor tycoon whose own son died of an incurable form of cancer. The world is shrinking. The elderly fellow from Boston pays for the young boy\'s family to fly to Jordan where there is a very dim hope of treatment with the tumor so far advanced. The doctors in Jordan do not know what will happen, but it is the only hope. It is not a miracle what happens next . A miracle would be something that defies all explanation. I don\'t yet believe that acts of human kindness defy all explanation. ----- The pursuit of athletic excellence is an ideal, just like the pursuit of global peace. They may both be fleeting things sometimes, but that doesn\'t mean they don\'t occasionally exist, even if only in very small batches. For just a few moments, when Michael Phelps breaks another world record, for a fleeting moment he is the pinnacle of athletic excellence. For just a few moments, when a young Iraqi boy walks out of a hospital in Jordan after treatment paid for by a elderly man in Boston, they are world peace. The world is shrinking. And it is not a bad thing. Aaaaand we\'re back. So as of today I am 30 years old. Things couldn\'t be better. I\'ve written before about what I think the advantages to getting older are and I still stand by those things. Bill Watterson once suggested that people who remember childhood as an idyllic time were probably never children, and that\'s a statement I agree with. It\'s not like being a kid was bad (it wasn\'t), but it\'s a pretty amazing (and sometimes scary) thing to have a modicum of control over your life. I also maintain it is awesome to be able to have the authority to scold those younger than you are. Age is the type of completely arbitrary authority that just increases with every passing day. Just this morning I pulled into the parking garage at work and there was a young fellow blasting music out of his car. Just the fact that I could legitimately think to myself:\'That young punk, what\'s he doing playing music at that volume this early in the morning\'and actually have a small part of that thought be automatically accurate (the part about him being\'young\'compared to me, not necessarily the part about being a punk, he\'s probably a real swell kid, I mean after all he is arriving at work at 7:30 AM just like I am, probably during his summer vacation) is the type of thing that I find internally amusing enough to keep me in a good mood. So, where have I been these past several months? Well, I haven\'t been doing anything particularly epic. Since getting married, Jules had been busy studying for the Delaware Bar Exam (a 3 day test which she finished taking last week, results in October) and I\'ve been doing... whatever it is that I do. And frankly that\'s what I LIKE doing. There was a time in the heady days of my youth (you know, like 8 years ago) where I would have been terrified of the notion of working a 35-40 hour a week job, settling in to some kind of routine. Now it\'s really what I enjoy most. Some of my best times are just relaxing at home talking to Jules, reading a book or watching baseball on the tube together. I\'m a much more boring guy than I used to be, but I consider that to be a good thing. So why haven\'t I been updating the blog then? What\'s the excuse? Well, there really isn\'t any. But I\'ve been thinking during all those months I haven\'t been writing about what this blog is exactly. Is it a journal? Is it a blog about games? Shouldn\'t it have a theme of some kind? And I\'ve kind of decided that there are enough blogs out there that spend their time discussing games, and enough blogs out there that are just journals. There are enough blogs out there that complain and mock various things, and really I\'m not as good at any of that stuff as they are. So as of today, I\'m going to try something new with the blog. I\'m going to go for a general theme of optimism. A general theme that says\'life can be pretty cool.\'That may still involve games that I think are fun and self-deprecating personal anecdotes and some of the other random stuff I throw up here... but the gist will be the type of kerfuffle that puts a smile on my face. We\'ll see, maybe it will put a smile on yours. And if you got this far, thanks for not unsubscribing from this thing. I\'m starting to see the following expression used more and more in various publications these days, particularly by journalists: Searching for X on Google produces Y results in Z seconds. If you haven\'t seen this before, let me give you a couple of examples: From Law.com : Online virtual worlds are wildly popular, attracting millions of people every day, and a recent Google search for MMORPG yielded approximately 32 million results. From the Toronto Star : Partner new Blue Jay shortstop David Eckstein and the word\'scrappy\'and a Google search will advise you of some 5,300 possibilities. In just 0.38 seconds, too. From Jose Canseco\'s new steroid book, Vindicated : Put in \'Alex Rodriguez\' and \'infidelity\' and you\'ll get like fifty thousand hits. The gist I guess is that there is supposed to be some correlation between X and Y . People, please stop this madness. Maybe you think it\'s a cute gimmick and a nice alternative to the old stock\'Meriam Webster defines \'infedility\' as...\'type of intro, but all it does is expose you as a complete idiot. For the love of god, there is no correlation between X and Y . It\'s a firk ding blasting search engine, it goes and gets as many results as it can. Allow me to demonstrate via the following examples of my own. If there was any question that more dinosaurs are wearing pink hats now than ever before, just pair\'pink hat\'with\'dinosaur\'in a Google search. You\'ll get 635,000 results in 0.17 seconds. I always thought bananas were funny looking, like they\'re from another planet. You might be surprised to hear that a Google search of\'aliens plant bananas\'yields 526,000 results in 0.29 seconds. Bananas may be the proof we need that we are not alone. Recycling for the planet is one thing, but what about recycling what our own body produces for ourselves? A quick Google search of\'lose weight by drinking raw sewage\'gives you 153,000 results in just 0.32 seconds. It\'s obviously an idea worth considering. To writers everywhere, I am begging you this last time to please stop this insanity, or so help me I will Google\'[your name here] is completely brain dead\', thus proving forever that somebody needs to pull your plug.
ruches - beehives Originally uploaded by parisdelhi Reconciling life in Togo and life in the US hasn\'t been fun. Contrary to what one would think given how the whole world is trying to train Africa out of its supposed backwardness, I have more or less come to the conclusion that the culture, eating habits, amount of physical activity, societal structure and the general way of life of my village in Togo are much healthier than those of the US. In the US we have plenty of money but we no longer know how to live, for the most part we are unhealthy and lost in modern life, and what is worse is that the rest of the world is trying to copy us. In Togo, for the most part people know how to live well. The only thing that is missing is a bit more money. That is where beekeeping becomes useful... One could very well argue that in the end money will manage to strip Africa of its knowledge of how to live well. In that case money is the culprit. pitching in Originally uploaded by parisdelhi To conclude TV or Radio news stories about climate change and the declining livability of the planet, the same message is often repeated: that scientists agree that recycling and more efficient cars and equipment will not suffice to greatly improve the prospects of maintaining a highly livable planet and avoiding the worst consequences of climate change. What is truly needed to improve our chances, scientists conclude, is for humans to fundamentally change their behavior. While listening to international dialog about the human-planet relationship, I hear talk of more efficient power plants and more recycling centers, that help us to comsume more with less or allow us to pollute less or as much while consuming more, I don\'t hear much serious talk about the scientific community approved idea of societal behavior change or cultural change. In very many ways, I find village life with its hard work, basic foods, and rudimentary entertainment, to be much more healthy than life in the modern desire-driven world. I am fully aware that clean water, good sources of nutrition, and health care are necessary, but how much more than that is NECESSARY? And to what extent does having MORE than that actually have a NEGATIVE impact on our mental and physical health, and on the health of our surrounding world? It is my belief that we spend much more money and resources solving problems created by modernity\'s attempt to satisfy desires than we spend solving the problem of fundmental needs. Finding fulfillment in the satisfaction of those fundamental needs and foregoing our 24/7 all you can eat\'desire saticiety,\'is a road that interests me. What does humanity want? Health, happiness, and the fulfillment of fundamental needs or the fulfillment of unending fleeting desires, less happiness, and declining human and environmental health? I\'ll end with a quote from Thomas Merton:\'No man can serve two masters. Your life is shaped by the end you live for. You are made in the image of what you desire.\'Humanity must decide what it wants and then make a conscious effort to pursue what it wants even if that entails modifying very dear cultural behaviors... DSC01635 Originally uploaded by parisdelhi While I was in Togo I had many personal debates taking place and some of them made their way onto this blog. Some debates encouraged external help coming to Africa and others would seem to discourage external aid. I am happy that I had all of those debates because they allowed me to explore international development, Africa, social change, and more, but I want to make clear that there is a place, a lot of places, for well conceived external help that responds to real needs. I will do my best to meet a few of those needs on a small scale where I can be competent. In the photo you see a young veterinary technician in his rural pharmacy. DSC01631 Originally uploaded by parisdelhi Coming back to the US can be damn hard. Once you are in the States, some wonderful feelings are felt but, no doubt, with the lack understanding ears, one can certainly become mildly and temporarily depressed. Finding the cultural continuity that I described in an earlier entry can be very helpful to recent Returned Peace Corps Volunteers (RPCVs), but in the interest of fellow RPCVs I would mention the possibility of collaborating to launch a small project back in your Peace Corps country. As we know, one must have some very effective ways to insure correct use of funds but with strong contacts on the ground and in our world of cell phones and western union, I have found that possible. Designing and providing funds for a small beekeeping project has given me the opportunity to do something meaningful. I planned this project with two fellow community members from my Togolese village and did not launch it to keep my emotions up. I helped plan it because I believed in it. I believe that this project will be effective, and that it will not create dependence, given the way we designed it. Because I believe so strongly in the effectiveness of the project and that I am doing the right thing in implementing it, it has given me a mission when my overseas Peace Corps mission has just officially ended. This project has also made me feel present in my Togolese community and happy to still be a member of that community and an active participant in its welfare. I may no longer be a Peace Corps Volunteer but I am still and will always be an Affem Boussou community member. DSC_0046-2.jpg Originally uploaded by JCTownsley I just heard Cornel West say\'Fetishism of commodities.\'He said\'It is also among the destitute because the destitute have a fetishism of commodities, a fetishism of success [and think] \'all I need is success, and then somehow I am a better person.\'I think it is hard for Togolese to escape the\'fetishism of commodities\'as they peer out into the world through TVs and Radios and I think it is very connected to what the Ugandan Farmer Said in my last entry. He said\'They shared a lot of things together...But now things have changed. Each person is on their own. A few people who have acquired material wealth are very scared of sliding back into poverty. They do not want to look like us.\'It is hard to not be a commodity fetisher in Togo as you learn of the rest of the world. And I believe the young generation will be heavily influenced by commodity fetishism but I also saw a lot of spiritually learned Muslims in Togo refuse commodity fetishism by emphasizing how fleeting and ephemeral earthly life is and how useless that makes attachment to money and things. A nomadic herder, himself a muslim, asked me, as I handed him money for taking me and my friends out in the bush with his cows,\'Do you think the prize is down here [on earth] Kabirou? Forget about the money.\'That came from a man that can live on 20 dollars a month and to whom I was handing 30 dollars. His photo accompanies this entry. I have seen less of that mysticism and refusal of worldly goods in the Christian areas of Togo, but I spent less time there. It is hard for Togolese to escape the\'Fetishism of commodities,\'in the the Commodity Fetisher Gala that is our world. That is sometimes hard to deal with as a Peace Corps volunteer who may have been able to join the Peace Corps in part because you have rejected commodity fetishism. You find that you and the Togolese are going in opposite directions, them toward and you away from commodities... The following two points of view get at a very sociological and anthropological aspect of\'Development\': How have Western fueled development and westward emigration affected home-grown development in Africa? Togo led me to ponder this question more and more as time went by.\'Poverty has always been with us in our communities. It was here in the past, long before the Europeans came, and it affected many - perhaps all of us. But it was a different type of poverty. People were not helpless. They acted together and they never allowed it to squeeze any member of the community. They shared a lot of things together: hunting, grazing animals, harvesting. There was enough for basic survival. But now things have changed. Each person is on their own. A few people who have acquired material wealth are very scared of sliding back into poverty. They do not want to look like us.\'- Ugandan farmer cited in Voices of the Poor, by Deepa Narayan; Oxford University Press: 2000. On a very similar note, In a 2006 article entitled\'OPEN THE BLINDS\', now RPCV Dan Mueller tells us of a fictional African village that was developing at its own pace before the world started trying to develop Africa. It would seem that Mueller is saying that organic grassroots development is made impossible or improbable by the promise of the developed world driving up in a 4 x 4 and magically developing the village with money. That prospect drastically changes the rules of the game of getting ahead and tears apart the fabric of the developing society. Mueller continues, saying that the prospect of emigrating to the\'developed\'rich world and living the good life blinds Africans and leads them to forget the organic development that their ancestors, like ancestors all over the world, were engaged in. Mueller sees this state of affairs as being quite obvious to the observant development worker. Eid al-Adha in village Life back in the US has offered me two satisfying moments of craved Togolese and Muslim cultural continuity. The first moment was meeting two Togolese men who are originally from the area of Togo where I lived. They speak the language of Kotokoli that I learned to an intermediate level while in Togo. Speaking Kotokoli, with all of the cultural importance that is placed on certain subject matters and moments in communication, renders unto the last two and a half years of my life the feeling of richness that memories of those years deserve. Richness that, with no fault to anyone, dissipates like fog in the US context. The second moment of cultural continuity came when I went to Friday prayer at a mosque here in Oregon. There were small differences, none of the Muslim rosaries that were ubiquitous in Togolese mosques, folks were Mi,\'le Eastern and Eastern European instead of African, and the sermon, that spoke to God\'s view on interest or making money off money, made reference to the Western cultural context of being Muslim in the US, to the credit crisis, Plato, and the Catholic church. Not only did I agree with the sermon\'s message, that we must refuse to make money our first priority, but, as speaking Kotokoli did, the sermon and the prayer that followed rendered the memory of life in Togo full and rich. Living in the US, It is easy for my life in Togo to be drained of its meaning and utility like a motor of its oil. Moments of cultural continuity put oil back in my motor. A poster of Barack sold in Togolese markets Originally uploaded by parisdelhi The morning following the election of Barack Obama, I heard two themes in the reactions of Togolese: 1) This election is a lesson in meritocratic democracy and social equality. 2) This election represents the official removal of the glass ceiling that many assumed would always differentiate the place of blacks and the place of whites in the world. The election certainly proved everything that I had said to Togolese about my experience of America and about what I believed that America was. It was very nice to walk around an American in Africa for that reason and for the reason that my country had just accomplished the feat of making an expression of love and humanity be heard unmuffled. I was proud. I was disappointed, however, that many assumed that I would vote for John McCain but I understand that assumption. While giving a class in a Togolese mi,\'le school on the US election process and on the 2008 campaign, I asked the students who they would vote for. They responded that they would vote for Obama. I asked them why and they caught themselves and we laughed as they scurried to find policy reasons for voting Obama. When asked who I would vote for, I joked with the students that\'of course I would vote for John McCain given my race.\'They understood that I was making the point that race or ethnicity should not determine who one votes for and we had another good laugh.
Dean\'s latest favorite toy - the ElliptiGO - is the basis for his attempt at the record books for\'most distance covered on an elliptical bike in 5 days\'. He will be ellipting (?) his way down the coast from San Francisco to Los Angeles, a distance of over 500 miles. You can follow him here . I first saw the ElliptiGO at the Death Ride last year . Pretty cool that you can get the athletic benefit of an elliptical trainer while enjoying the outdoors. Here are some pics, courtesy of Eric C Gould : Leor Pantilat won for the 2nd year in a row (3:41:47), aided by a wrong turn by leader Geoff Roes (who still finished third in 3:51:51 ), and out-kicking Max King (2nd, 3:47:39). Joelle Vaught, who won in 2006, ran alone in first most of the race to win (4:13:53) after key rival Kami Semick dropped from stomach issues and flu-like symptoms. Bev Anderson-Abbs came in 2nd female/1st masters (4:29:40), a very strong performance just a few weeks after running a 50-miler, and Darcy Africa was 3rd&nbsp; (4:37:12).

PERFORMANCE ELEVATED™. www.mountainhardwear.com &nbsp; Yesterday I had the great pleasure of joining 200 runners for the Caumsett State Park 50k in Lloyd Harbor, NY, put on by New York Ultra Running . As the USATF 50k Road Championships, lots of speed demons were out to enjoy one of the first sunny days to come after a long, hard northeast winter. What better way than a 10 lap loop course with fellow ultra warriors? As I warmed up with Team Inov-8 runner Ben Nephew , we agreed that the day had a lot the right ingredients for a breakthrough PR. Although the temp was in the high 30\'s, the sun would warm up the day to ideal low 50\'s by the halfway point. Short of some wind gusts, this was MUCH better than snow/sleet/sub-zero Caumsett 50k\'s of the past. Plus there were a lot of great runners here - 2x defending champ and course record holder (2:56) Michael Wardian , Scott Jaime (pronounced Hi-Me) from Colorado, 50k Masters American Record holder Dan Verrington , 24-hour American Record holder Mark Godale , 24-hour National Team member Phil McCarthy, Montrail runners Annette Bednosky and Jill Perry , the great Scott Jurek, and a half dozen more that could go sub-3:30 on a good day. I felt like a kid meeting my favorite rock stars! &nbsp; (Ben Nephew and I sport the new Team Inov-8 shirts) &nbsp; (Staying warm at the start) My personal goal for the day was to improve on my 50k PR (3:37 at the 2009 Ruth Anderson 50k ). My speed work was going INSANELY well over the last three months, particularly by teaching me that I could be in a lot of pain and still hold my form. To achieve a PR, like any stretch goal, you need three things. First, you need to show up (check). I know that sounds simple, but as we all know, getting the start line healthy and ready can be tough. Second, you need the opportunity, like a day of perfect weather and runners faster than you (check). Third, you need to believe that it is possible to achieve something beyond your best (check, thank you speedwork). Let\'s DO THIS! At 8:30am, Suffolk County Legislator Jon Cooper sent off the 50k runners (30 minutes ahead of the 25k runners) and the front pack quickly spread out. Wardian, Jesse Regnier (in his first race beyond 8 miles), and 2:19 marathoner Malcolm Campbell went out hard, running 5:30 min/miles. Scott Jaime and Malcolm Campbell each ran solo at a sub-6 pace a few steps back, and Dan Verrington, Ben Nephew, Mark Godale and I clocked 6 min./miles in the next chase pack. Dan was doing most of the work in our pack, letting us know right up front that he was shooting for\'3 and low teens since the 45-49 50k American Record is soft at 3:17\'. I guess he would know - it\'s his record! We finished the first lap in 18 minutes. My God, this was fast. &nbsp; (Mark Godale, Ben Nephew, and Dan Verrington chasing Scott Jaime) &nbsp; &nbsp;(Michael Wardian and Jesse Raginer finish up lap #1) We got sight of the Womens race on the out and back section, and front runners Annette Bednosky, Jill Perry, and Yolanda Flamino were sticking close to each other. Last years champ and course record holder, Kami Semick, was not present today so it was anyone\'s race. They were all keeping each other in sight. &nbsp; (Jill Perry leads Annette Bednosky and Yolanda Flamino) Ben Nephew was nice enough to help pace the pack with Dan, but around lap 3 (mile 9) Dan picked up the pace charging the uphill grades and dropped us. Mark Godale fell off the pace, and Ben and I speculated that he probably wasn\'t in peak shape thanks to daughter #3 recently arriving. We both had 3-year-olds and knew how that could crimp a training plan, but #3? Fuggetaboutit. &nbsp; (Scott Jaime gives a thumbs up) On each subsequent lap, we molted layers of hats, gloves, sleeves, wool, etc. until we were down to our tank tops in the 45-degree air. Ben continued to do the lion\'s share of the pacing, running with a short and powerful stride from all his snowshoeing. I was nursing a sore shoulder from a sex-related injury (best if I don\'t provide detail on that one, but let me recommend that you stretch out before ANY strenuous exercise), but otherwise feeling strong. The aid station volunteers at both stops were amazing, and we barely had to slow for whatever we needed. On lap 6 (mile 18), my body demanded a bio break and I made a absurdly efficient 20-second stop at the port-a-potty. Ben wished me well, and from that point on he would be little more than a dot on the horizon. That was okay though - I knew the last third was going to be a three-night stay in the House of Pain, and it felt proper to venture into that valley of darkness alone. &nbsp;(Local ultrarunners not obeying the speed limit) I wasn\'t alone, however, since thanks to the loop format I got to see EVERYONE. The New York Ultra Runners were having a great day and making the most of the early signs of Spring. I exchanged atta-boys with 78-year-old Sam Soccoli from North Babylon, NY, and the famous Roy Pirrung who was defying his 62-year-old age with a sub-5 hour pace. 70-old Patricia Delaney was also making good time, and always had a smile on. They sure breed \'em tough out here! At Lap 8, I hit the marathon mark in 2:48 (almost a PR!) and fought desperately to hold my form. Michael Wardian gave a few words of encouragement as he lapped me, slowing but still on course record pace. At the turnaround, I could see that Dan Verrington had passed Scott Jaime, but Scott was keeping him in sight. Ben was still holding on strong and was about a minute ahead of me now. The Womens race found Yolanda Flamino in front after dropping the hammer on lap 3 and gapping the other women by a good 15 minutes. Annette Bednosky, however, was picking up speed in one of her classic negative split finishes. &nbsp; (Ben Nephew keeps cranking) As I entered Lap 10, my stomach knotted up, my head started spinning, and my muscles began twitching like crazy. My pace had slowed to a 7 minute mile as I walked the two aid stations to try and get more liquids in. The pain. My God, the pain! I could feel my heartbeat in the back of my eyeballs. But as the mile markers reminded me, this was almost over. Annette was kind enough to pick up the pace and run along with me until the last 1/2 mile, and I gave it everything. I crossed the finish in 3:20:48, good enough for 6th overall. &nbsp;(Mark Godale and Dan Verrington talk about the race) I laughed out loud as I crossed the finish line. Did that just happen? Did I just take 17 minutes off my PR? Either the training is going well, or I have been seriously sandbagging for a long time now. As I spoke with the other finishers, it turns out many of them had breakthrough days. Michael Wardian (2:55) had beat his previous record by 40 seconds, with Malcolm Campbell (3:04) getting second with a great performance. Scott Jaime (3:13) had passed Dan Verrington (3:15) to claim third and the Masters win, but Dan set a new 45-49 age group American Record in the process. Ben was quite pleased with his 3:18 best on this course, and Mark Godale charged in the last laps to finish a few minutes behind me. Jesse Raginer clocked a 3:28 in his first 50k - not bad at all! &nbsp;(2010 Womens 50k Road National Champion, Yolanda Flamino) (Scott Jaime gets the Masters payday from RD Amy Goldstein) Yolanda Flamino won the Womens division in 3:34, with Annette Bednosky (3:43) taking second and winning the Masters division in a time well under her goal. Jill Perry (3:47) fought through some tough spots to hold onto third. ( full results ) &nbsp; &nbsp;(Scott Jurek, me, and 2010 50k Road National Champion, Michael Wardian) &nbsp; (Sporting the hardware with 3rd place Womens finisher Jill Perry) I felt like an Olympian with all my medals (a gorgeous finisher medal, a USATF medal for 6th overall and a USATF medal for 2nd in 40-44), and was tickled to get the $50 check for third Master. Paydays are rare in this sport! My thanks to RD Amy Goldstein, her wonderful volunteers and sponsors, Howard Nippert and the crew at USATF, and the nice folks of Long Island for putting on a great race. Thanks to the opportunity, assistance, and support you provided, I had a breakthrough day! &nbsp; (Schwag overload! I\'m in heaven...) Michele Wallace from the San Diego News wrote a fun article about Mike and Kim Rouse, a couple who (somehow) gets along while training for ultras, Ironmans, and even the Ultraman. I love their quotes about each other - it\'s truly a match made in heaven! You can read the whole article here . &nbsp; (Photo courtesy of poet Ollie Lind ) Have you ever noticed that half of the stories in endurance magazines sound like Mad Libs for people in recovery? Sometimes I swear they just plug in the facts:\'[Name] got into running after recovering from [near-fatal disease or accident] just [random number] years ago.\'I was in bed, feeling sorry for myself, [another random number] pounds overweight, and my [body part] looked like [bad food or construction analogy] . I decided the best way to beat [near-fatal disease or accident] was to celebrate the health I had one day at a time. I trained for months and completed [major race] . I\'m not embarrassed about my [body part] since it gives me a chance to educate others about [near-fatal disease or accident] . I\'ve now hooked up with [charity of near-fatal disease or accident] to run more, and hope to inspire others with [near-fatal disease or accident] and be living proof it is possible to overcome.\'Unfortunately it\'s easy to gloss over the message in these formulaic summaries. In truth, there is something very powerful at the heart of these tales. This is Part II of my long run revelations:\'To lead a fulfilled life, embrace death.\'I\'ve had the good fortune of losing some friends and family in the last six months. I know that sounds backwards, since the pain and loss that immediately accompanies such devastation is soul-crushing. But by embracing loss and authentically internalizing the myriad of feelings that surround it, life feels more precious. Life IS more precious. If we are living, we are survivors. We should all embrace life as fully as our formulaic heroes. It\'s such a shame that most of us can easily avoid our own finality in day-to-day routine, distracting media, and pharmacologically-enhanced lives. Comfort is good, and probably necessary for some level of sanity, but it\'s important to regularly remind yourself not to take it all for granted. I often feel this is the reason many of us enter endurance events and push our personal limits - we surround ourselves in pain and adventure so thick that we can\'t escape asking ourselves the very basic questions of what makes us happy, what makes us tick, and what gives life meaning. Through the pain, we grow, and for days afterward, we cherish every breath, every sunset, and every laugh. At the 2009 Western States, I got so deep it got scary . But the serenity that followed lasted for weeks, even months, and was nothing short of life-changing. If 27+ hours on the trail is all it takes to reach that level of enlightenment and peace, it may very well have been the easiest thing I have ever done. Embrace your finality. Treasure the moments you have. See life in its fullest hue. It\'s the best way to honor those who left before you, and makes for MUCH better stories. - SD [You can also read Long Run Revelations, Part I - There Is No Such Thing As Work/Life Balance, Only Life Balance ] I\'ve recently seen a large increase in traffic to this blog from blogger.com, meaning more and more bloggers are following me. Great to have you! Just in case it\'s helpful, I thought I would share a few tips picked up from analyzing traffic over the last few months. We all have different goals for blogging, and it\'s totally fine if you don\'t ever analyze your traffic or try to boost your readership. But I will say once you start looking into it, you will be surprised how many people are connecting to your insights. Here a few quick and simple ways to boost your traffic: 1) Use an analytics service . Wonder how I knew about the increase in traffic from blogger.com? My analytics service helped me track it. If you aren\'t using one, I would suggest you do. Most of these services are free - StatCounter and Google Analytics being two of my favorites - and will start giving you fascinating data immediately after you a,\' a few lines of code to your template or a,\' a widget. Imagine being able to see who sends the most traffic, which search words bring people to your site, and how folks navigate your blog. This week my top referral sites were run100s.com (Stan Jensen\'s encyclopedic site on ultrarunning), wikipedia (largely on Dean Karnazes inquiries), and forum.somethingawful.com (from a forum conversation that linked to toenail removal), and my top search terms were\'caballo blanco\',\'coconut water\', and\'cross country championships\'. It\'s a fascinating time suck. ;-) Once you get some analytics, a few of these other suggestions will make sense. 2) A,\' the LinkWithin widget . If you look at the bottom of my blog entry, you\'ll see a thing that suggests other blog posts you might like. That\'s LinkWithin , and it\'s a very simple free widget to a,\'. On average, it has increased my traffic 18% without having to do a thing. But more importantly, it helps convert a lot of first time visitors into reading 2-3 pages. O,\'s are a few of them will be more regular readers. 3) Bring on the pics ! Behind Google, my #2 contributor of traffic is images.google.com. This is from people looking for pictures of trail running, parks, people, etc., and has continuously been one of the big attractors of new readers to my blog. You can help Google figure out what your pictures are about with some clever image naming, such as\'2009_xterra_trail_running_world_championship_hawaii_max_king_winning.jpg\'. Think about how many image searches might hit that - xterra, max king, hawaii trail running, etc. - especially over time. I\'ve found a direct correlation to the number of pictures in a blog entry, and the number of visitors over time. Basically you can\'t ever have too many and if you name the images correctly, they will pull readers in for years to come. On the flip side, I recently tried out\'Snapshots\', a widget that popped up a pre-link window that did not do much for traffic so I turned it off. I\'ve also a,\'ed\'recent comments\'on the right, but haven\'t seen a noticeable change in traffic. But I find it useful, so I will leave it up a bit longer. Got a great tip? Let me hear it! It\'s how we all get better. Thx, SD Olympians and all-around running superstars Dathan Ritzenheim and Shalane Flanagan dominated the USA Cross Country Championships in Spokane, WA, this weekend. This was Dathan\'s third and Shalane\'s fourth national cross country title. &nbsp;(Dathan Ritzenhein, photo courtesy of Photorun.net ) Joining Dathan (34:34 for 12k) on the national team are Minnesotan Patrick Smyth (34:52), Chico, CA\'s Scott Bauhs (35:01), fellow Eugene, OR runner Ben Bruce (35:16), Admore, PA\'s Bobby Curtis (35:22), and Gresham, OR\'s Ryan Vail (35:25). &nbsp;(Shalane Flanagan, photo courtesy of Photorun.net ) Shalane (25:10 for 8k) led by 51 seconds, with 10k superstar Molly Hu,\'le (26:01), Flagstaff, AZ\'s Amy Hastings (26:09), Olympian Magdelena Lewy Boulet (26:09), Boulder\'s Rene Metivier Baillie (26:26), and Mammoth Lake, CA\'s Sara Hall (26:27) rounding out the team.

Apparent Dip is thrilled and profoundly happy to announce that my endorsement of Barack Obama for president appears to have worked, tipping the balance in crucial states, and leading to an overwhelming victory for Barack Obama.I am unfortunately listening to television pundits try to sound profound right now. John McCain gave a fantastic concession speech, I am glad he did not speak like that during the campaign, I feel the contest would have been much closer.Time to watch his acceptance speech!

An Excerpt from an Unpublished August Journal: Once upon a time I stood on a street corner and peered into the canal, thinking that it was just as good a reason as any for living. Certainly, I formed an analogy between its flowing water and my own blood, reflecting once again upon the minimal difference between that which is within us and that which is without (is there not a fantastic sameness in both form and function when considering trees and the lungs of animals?). The powdered pinkness of the dying sun reflected in the water, the approaching ivory-on-saphire army of midnight swans, poised for majesty and intimidation, the ghostly cleaning boat of yesteryear, surrounded by its cloud of steam and guided only by a few piercing bright lights: these are the images that force one to remain motionless on the bridge, afraid to budge for fear of missing one valuable second. \'Rage, rage, against the dying day...\' For as long as I can remember, I have wished to hold images close to me, as though they were tangible objects. For a time, I believed this to be harmful or foolish, a fetishistic act of consumption useful only for the continual harvest of an insatiable hunger. But now I understand the way in which this reorganization of life informs my happiness; I call it Magical Realism. When I was a teenager I lived solely in a place of magical realism. At some point I have been each and every one of my great heroes, a cause to which I remained dedicated regardless of whether or not another person was present to verify the occurrence. The first few times I allowed others to pass into my private realm were common but necessary, images so familiar they might have been plucked from any coming of age biopic-reading aloud from the Ginsberg anthology, enthusiasm fueled by stolen warm champagne, cross legged on the black cushion, youth tuned into youth (a concentration permitted only by the suspension of worry available in those days), giving finally a small performance of I Shall Be Released... The morning after such exploits, when I climbed the hill near my parent\'s house and sat staring into the rising sun, its ageless pu,\'le of light slowly engulfing every branch and stone, I had effectively transcended time. There was no great stopwatch separating myself from my heroes, for the experience of self-realization and initial discovery is always a virgin entity; its ability to repeat itself yet always be different lies in its being the definition of newness. The only absolute newness is creation. As a creator of music, I sometimes forget what it is like to experience music from an entirely non-critical point of view. So, what does this mean for me, Berlin and the life blood canal that once extended before my eyes? It is arguable that all the wandering souls of the world (people like myself) have inherited Christopher Isherwood\'s haunted, candlelit land of eccentric intellectuals and cabaret shows and morphed it into an aimless place of hedonism and anti-everything logic, but really, it just depends on how you see it. If I can, for just one minute, block out the chattering buzz of the millions of technological advances that demand such an unending life force (phones, the internet, the ever-present flash of digital cameras), then I am left only with the advancing army of swans, the pink water, the beautiful memory of the ex-Soviet bar, competing musical instruments drifting into consciousness from afar... In this moment, Rosie is Sally Bowles and I am Bryan Roberts, and when I get home, she will be there,\'dolled up for Easter.\'Thoughts from the Present: So, many miles from Berlin, I am giving myself over to music again; this is my aim and my wish. Lost in a little village of guitar feedback and drum machines, I ponder the separation between the man and the music, the world and the single voice, the unceasing flow and the magic quality of a single moment. Thrills, spills, mistakes, regrets, reflections, and most importantly, things to be thankful for, paint my vision in a rather kaleidoscopic manner, light refracting through a crystal lattice work. All the cities drift by, among them the seven hills of Lisbon, the unrelenting stone facade of Bushwick, the dark retro bars of St. Pauli, the mountain and warm cheese in Mexico, and of course, the chalky rose canal that carried me through Berlin, across the ocean and directly into this moment-this moment, in which I am forced to remember how much magic has truly transpired. Here I must digest all of this magic, allow it to dissipate among my cells, forming a lightning-fast network of electrical energy. Slowly, it quells my anxiety and gets to work taking my little place of magical realism-the attic in Wimpole Street, the blue bulb of the stage light, the love affair with a guitar-from fantasy to the other side. And so, once again, a handprint is stamped across time. Nico - I\'ll Keep It With Mine MP3 Photograph by Martin Parr, from\'The Last Resort.\'Today I had a good feeling. Having planned to meet my friends from Hamburg, Sonja and Niki, for a rare combination of sustenance and culture, I walked out my front door, turned right, and traced the almost straight line to the Samaritestrasse U-Bahn station. Before I could reach my final destination, Oranienburger strasse, I was required to make two changes, one at Alexanderplatz, and another at Friedrichstrasse. Normally, such a circuitous route would spark in me some form of anxiety (I tend to be unnecessarily short tempered when traversing the urban landscape) but today I didn\'t mind. In fact, the whole process transcended me as though by some divine intervention, and while I was making the first change at Alexanderplatz I experienced the wonderful (see how it has been upgraded from good to wonderful) feeling of which I earlier spoke. The feeling was this: for the first time since moving to Berlin, I was not conscious of where I was or where I was going; my thoughts were elsewhere-perhaps I was mentally reviewing a new piece of music, or possibly just reviewing the vacuous space that was beginning to fill my stomach region-but either way, I certainly was not forcing myself to be continuously critical of my every move. There\'s a certain self-consciousness, a kind of continual embarrassment, that goes along with being a new person in any place. You have sense that, at any given moment, every capable citizen is watching you, secretly laughing at your every misstep. But today I was just a piece of the machine, an ordinary gear in the ever-expansive clock of human interaction. Sometimes it\'s nice to be part of a machine, it just has to be the right one. I arrived early, and spent about thirty minutes in the park, watching the sun\'s angle decline, appreciating the fact that I was using this civic gift just as it was intended to be used: reading, watching, depositing my cigarette ash in the ashtray provided for me by the government, understanding how parks act as little pu,\'les of serenity, placed evenly around a city to balance out the madness. Parks are almost living proof that everyone, even those in charge, is aware that life is more stressful than it needs to be. After lunch, we filed into the Martin Parr exhibition. I don\'t know how much you know about Martin Parr, but before today I knew absolutely nothing. The briefing I had received (from my friend Moritz) was that his work focuses mainly on the grotesque contrasts/contradictions of modern Western society, both at home and in areas of reduced financial prosperity. It is often the work of juxtaposition: statues of the Virgin Mary underneath a McDonald\'s awning, British tourists stuffing their faces at a Belgian holiday resort surrounded by garbage, sun-bleached couples seemingly miserable on a crowded ocean front. Interestingly enough, there were quite a few photographs of Glasgow, which is obviously of great interest to me. Some, I did think, were particularly harrowing, specifically the photo of the men\'s barber shop, the walls of which were entirely covered with images of naked women. However, there were certain photographs that did not fill me with any sense of disgust. I remember, very specifically, a photograph which portrays a Glasgow street, one where most of the buildings have been demolished and thus there remains only one or two tenements, one or more of their sides exposed. In the foreground of the image one can see a Tennents beer sign, indicating the door to a pub. Obviously, the idea is that, amongst such urban desolation, the most popular escape is liquid mental abandon in an aesthetically-impoverished setting, but when I saw this, the first thought that flashed into my mind was, Sometimes life just looks like that. I lived in Glasgow for three and a half years, and although I was a) a foreigner, and thus, in some ways, a tourist, and b) living in a very nice part of Glasgow, I still lived there, and I still frequented quite a few places that didn\'t look entirely unlike this one. Glasgow has a kind of grit and I don\'t think it\'s something to be ashamed of. During my time there, I picked up on an almost beautiful force, a simultaneous wisdom and madness that allows the people there to be drawn so close to each other, a sort of universal refuge under all that grey brick and grey sky. It is my belief that, an image such as the one I have described, is totally ignorant of that positive energy. Two other images really captivated me. The first was of an elderly woman wearing a white cap and orthopedic shoes, eating alone in a McDonalds, hunched over the table. Even as I\'m describing it now, it\'s nearly bringing tears to my eyes. I have knowingly done any number of things to destroy my body (drinking, smoking, whatever...), but this woman, why is she doing this? It\'s one thing to see a younger person eating a processed hamburger but it\'s entirely different when you see an elderly woman carrying out the same act. All I can think is that, either she doesn\'t know any better, or it\'s the only option she can afford, which brings me to my next thought: Why the fuck do fast food companies make this shit available to people?! Yeah, consumers have a choice, but all people, especially those in the business of distributing food products, must be perfectly aware that not all are consumers are equally educated, and thus they knowingly provide the crutch for susceptible eaters. Drugs like heroin and cocaine are also really bad for you, and often a crutch, but they\'re fucking illegal, aren\'t they? I don\'t know why the powers that be, or people in general (who I suppose are the powers that be) are not bothered by this image of lonely old woman hunched over a styrofoam plate. I just keep imagining that it\'s my grandmother, who lived as a widow for the last forty years of her life, sat by herself in a soulless plastic box of a restaurant, thinking to herself, Life is so unfair. It fucking breaks my heart. The second image which caught my eye is one which depicts a slew of tourists at a Brighton beach resort, waiting to get to the front of a fast food queue. It is somewhat of an action/motion shot, causing the majority of depicted individuals to appear blurred. However, in complete focus, at the far right of the shot, stands a boy of somewhere between eleven and thirteen years, his right arm akimbo as he stares thoughtfully out of the frame and into the present. The remarkable thing about this boy is that he has the face and complete composure of a grown man. Not the facial hair and wrinkles, or course, but rather the sense of understanding and inherent wisdom. During my time as a pre-school teacher, I noticed this trait in some of my students. The viewing of this phenomenon always fills me with a mixed sense of wonder, admiration and sadness, for in some ways, to understand too much too young is a hindrance. Does this boy remember the day the photograph was taken? What was he thinking about? The photograph is from 1985. He must be in his mid thirties by now. As he walks the streets of whichever British town or city in which he resides, does he still have that same glaze of guaranteed assurance? Does he think to himself, I\'ve got the answer-I\'ve always had the answer? And on the day the photograph was taken did he surmise that it was grotesque, that he was grotesque, that the whole situation of Western capitalism was, for all intents and purposes, grotesque? Fat. Ugly. Unhealthy. Probably not, he probably just accepted that day as it happened, for that\'s how we live, isn\'t it? An image is capable of highlighting, later on, an essence that was present all the time, but went unnoticed. Its power resides in its retrospective quality. And I suppose that\'s why Carr\'s work, or any artist\'s work is important, even if it sometimes neglects the fullness of the human experience: Be part of the machine, enjoy and accept the things around you, but don\'t forget, once and a while, to stop and criticize. I\'ve just returned from Glasgow, where I\'ve finished up a recording with members of Michael Dracula, Belle and Sebastian, Mother and the A,\'icts, and obviously, myself. I\'m quite pleased with it. Not sure when it will be finished, if ever. The song was recorded at Green Door Studios. In other news, I\'ve relocated to Berlin, I\'m not sure for what, some sort of inspiration no doubt, so if anybody is kicking about and wants to hang out or play music or whatever, please drop me a line. I\'m ready to restart, rewrite, re-everything. No more fear, no more holding back, time for brilsolage. PLUS.... this pink chair in my sublet is BLOODY FANTASTIC. Love, Ramesh Novicat de Soeurs Missionaires de Notre Dame d\'Afrique & four religious drummers - Yesu Ka Mkwebase MP3 Dear Lacey, I was busy writing about something else, the loss of innocence and all this kind of shit, when I was su,\'enly distracted by your memory, or rather the memory of you, and thought that perhaps it would be better if I just wrote you instead. I believe it\'s because I was writing about high school, that miserable place which afforded us little more education than the camaraderie and independence that grew up inside of us, partially the product of choice, partially the product of necessity, that shared closeness that comes with the experience of being a social outsider. More specifically, I was recalling the bit of forest behind the school, the one we were never meant to visit, past the portable classrooms and pick up trucks, and that horrendous chain-link fence, the one which separates truancy from athletic participation. There\'s something really beautiful about that piece of land, that delicate fabric of trails and open fields which reminds you, if only for a second, that perhaps central Texas is not the worst place on Earth, a beauty which is no doubt enhanced by its forbi,\'en quality. I\'m sure it was you who made me go there first, or maybe it was Courtney. I can never be sure. You were always forcing me to do stuff like that, to bend rules, to push boundaries, not so much because you were a junior revolutionary, but more because you had the foresight to understand that these temporary rules enacted to govern the lives of young adolescents are, really and truly, complete and utter shit. Like the time you convinced me to ditch the career fair, and we spent the whole day mucking around South Austin; you bought me a sandwich, and then we rolled our pants up, halved a piece of cake, and climbed carefully but deftly down the root-encrusted bank to the still and forgotten creek behind the sandwich shop. I might not be pushing it if I said that was one of the best days of my life. Yes, that\'s what I remember-little moments of freedom. I think we were quite good at that, our little group. We attended school in a place where it is customary to see Confederate flags, where the term\'faggot\'is thrown around with little to no objection, and where unconditional praise of the athletically gifted is encouraged (all typical traits of the southern experience, but one has to remember that it\'s disturbing that these things should ever become normalized). And so, in our own futile rebellion, we ate our lunches outside under the trees, sported our montage of paisley retro gear, pinstriped vests, and Goodwill t-shirts, celebrated Bob Dylan\'s birthday with chocolate cake at seven in the morning, and generally tuned out the world by filling our ears with music that was long ago forgotten by many-or so I thought at the time. Of course this is a regular occurrence, that feeling of togetherness which is born out of isolation, but I like to think there was something a bit different about our situation -it wasn\'t identifiable as any nationwide youth trend, but it was instead a bond colored by a complete and total obsession with the past, a fundamental belief that things were inherently cooler in the sixties. And they were. The first week of school, I didn\'t even know you, but I knew you enough to think that I was in love with you. And then, with minimal provocation, you agreed to sew onto my bag all the patches which I had collected over the summer-The Grateful Dead, Jim Morrison, The Beatles, Bob Marley... The most obvious characters of retro obsession, which at that point, for me, held no cultural association of mainstream taboo. Yours was the most finite stitching I had ever seen, so evenly spaced, and with all the patches placed at angles that allowed them to exist in perfect harmony. As soon as I held the now-transformed vessel in my hand, I knew that I was definitely in love with you, and always would be. Maybe that\'s the benefit of going to school in the mi,\'le of nowhere: the popular trends take longer to reach you, the only norm is mainstream country music, so you have to find something on your own, something that moves you and gives you shelter from your incongruous environment, the one that, as somebody quite clever once sai,\'dsays nothing to me about my life.\'There is one event that I remember quite vividly, sticks out in my mind, a party held on your mother\'s land, just across the creek from your father\'s, in that magical nowhere dip where the only signs of life were the distant silhouettes of cows, presumably in place for tax purposes. On this particular night, we had managed to craft something of truly Kesey-esque proportions: Everything in my memory is shrouded in the flickering of several campfire lights, brief flashes of beards and naked skin, the competing strums of acoustic guitars, the kids from the neighboring school (namely your boyfriend and his team of beautiful hooligans) with their Kent III shirts, converse and gas station wine situated at the opposite flame, the constant sound of didgeridoos (by this point, the Alaskans had arrived and firmly planted themselves on your land and in your heart), and last but not least the incredible image of Courtney channeling Mountain Girl, wandering from person to person, offering each friend a poem from a jar, which had been folded into a pyramid shape (the poem, not the jar).\'A poem for you...\'That night, as David and I were ascending from the wilderness and back into my car, I remember turning around for one last look at the circle below of fire, bodies, and drone, and remarking to David that it looked exactly like a National Geographic special, a fitting description, for earlier that week, you and I had fought because you assured me that, if given the choice, you would abandon all things familiar and Western, and relocate to a specific Aboriginal tribe where a popular game included forming a large circle with linked arms, consistently altering the resulting shape so as to avoid being touched by the shade of an overhead cloud. In this moment I believed that, maybe, just maybe, you were being sincere. Just as well, then, that you left us for Alaska, left school early to pursue something that, all in all, was far more worthwhile. Sometimes I can\'t escape thinking that perhaps your decision to follow those bearded Alaskans up into the wilderness meant you knew that you were to die young. Although, I think everybody once and a while believes they are to die young, at least I hope that\'s a universal premonition, otherwise I should be concerned. Sometimes I try to imagine all the events I missed while I was sweeping away at the cinema: the day you cut off your, long, famous hair, the endless paths carved through such esoteric towns as Moab, Utah in pursuit of that great, northern paradise, the hours spent studying the teachings of a Western guru, and lastly the days spent in that cabin alone in Alaska, trying to understand, as you said to me, your relationship with God. But there are things I do remember, things I don\'t have to imagine, like the many trips down to the University in search of several spoonfuls of bohemian insight, all of us lying in wait in my heavily shrouded bedroom, unanimously dreading the possibility that any parent might arrive before my father\'s decaying cassette copy of\'Sounds of Silence\'had come to completion. Or an evening spent in my now-donated Mercedes (used, of course); eyes closed as the song I\'d written for you surged from the speakers, through my body, and eventually from my left hand into your right, all but filling the dense yet awkward-less silence. And then, of course, the last time I saw you. You were leaving for Alaska or I was leaving for Europe, I can\'t remember which. That evening I was closing down the theater, clad in maroon vest and nylon necktie. I met you in the parking lot for a hurried goodbye (sometimes that\'s the only thing available). Standing outside in the vast space between the bookstore and the cinema entrance, one of us (I can\'t remember which) sai,\'dI don\'t know when I\'ll see you again,\'and the other replie,\'dIt doesn\'t matter,\'not as an indication of apathy, but instead a reminder that deep-rooted love is something you carry with you, like a talisman, or rather like that essential piece of metal sewn into the wall of my stomach lining.\'Even when I\'m not with you, my love is with you...\'Each year, on the anniversary of your death, I intend to write something and never do, a disservice I always regret. Instead, I\'d like to remind you of something you wrote, something I had forgotten about until I saw your father at David\'s funeral the other day. There is more to say about David, but nothing you don\'t know, and now is not the time or place. He (your father) said to me that it\'s finally time to begin taking apart your room, to free himself of the many possessions left behind in that upstairs purple abode. As a start on the project of purging, I was handed a package containing photographs of you and David (I had forgotten how the two of you looked so much like identical twins), along with a story you\'d written for school when we were fourteen or so, detailing where you might be in ten years. I stored these items somewhere safe (so safe I can\'t remember the exact location) and thus I am unable to quote your original text. But here\'s what I can remember-I can remember the rough penmanship, the sort that can only belong to a girl of fourteen, and I can remember the happiness that it brought me years ago when first I glimpsed it, a happiness which was rekindled when it was re-delivered to me much later. Fortunately I can also remember the general outline of my favorite part. It had something to do with you joining NASA, training to become an astronaut and traveling to the moon several times. After that vision of yours was quenched, you married me, we had three beautiful children, and I like to think that we lived happily ever after. If you\'d only known how, at the time, I carried this story inside of me, intentionally ignorant of its casual intent, and allowed it to foster all kinds of beautiful hopes within my being. But maybe it wasn\'t all disingenuous. As we discussed earlier, love is something that you carry with you always, regardless of its form. So many years later, all I can say is this: I\'m glad this was your dream-because it was mine too. Love, Ramesh It\'s incredible to think of all of us out there in the world who want nothing more than to rest a head against a foreign body, passing each other in the street, continuing on with the same little empty space tucked somewhere deep inside. But it\'s all relative. I don\'t even need to elaborate upon why my concern of loneliness is partially ridiculous. Famine, hunger... these are much worse, and perhaps with my little plea I\'m tempting the Gods of true loneliness. Let\'s hope not. That\'s the thing- sometimes I feel like a spoiled fucking brat because I have a shell-shocked attitude regarding the things that surround me on a daily basis. I don\'t care about record reviews. I don\'t care about the internet. I don\'t care about the relative popularity of other similar bands who, apparently, the internet has told me I should view as competition. I care about writing music. I care about people, and they\'re getting harder and harder to hold close to me, or perhaps even to grasp in the first place. Maybe it\'s because I\'m lonely. Maybe it\'s because I\'m hungover. Maybe it\'s because I came to the most beautiful city in the world and couldn\'t make it work. I wanted to relive that magical morning of my life with the marlboro lights and the window and the stack of NMEs. Sometimes I get really scared because I don\'t care about anything, and that\'s just fucking stupid because in the moments where it\'s all seemed on the brink of loss I\'ve never been more afraid. It\'s those seconds where you realize that you don\'t make your own rules that really shake you up. When I get this way I have to comfort myself with the fact that I have music in my life. Music understands the fact that I run through life too fast and expect everything to happen instantly. I\'m just going to give myself to the stage, go into hiding and write something great, bounce around and kick my feet and scream and strum and scream and strum... Twee as fuck: Here is a\'synchronized\'routine we devised in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Check Matt (Favourite Sons)\'s solo at the end. I\'ve just fully realized that our album actually comes out tomorrow. That\'s really exciting. Today, we\'re filming our first music video, which is a process I had never even thought possible. Watching people film in double time is amazing! The video is for Firecracker, which I\'ve decided is my favorite song on the record, along with Real Live Version (a song written for Judee Sill-it\'s supposed to sound like that) and Blood Red Blood. Or at least those are the songs whose outcome reached their initial intentions the best... This Friday we start our tour, which continues for about five weeks, a daunting prospect but fun nonetheless. It\'s interesting, this process we\'ve been going through recently of having to bring the songs from the record into the live set. It was nice doing a bit of experimenting with sound when making the record, but I suppose the trick is figuring how to give the songs an equal amount of live energy as their counterparts. At least in Austin and New York, we have Tosca on our side and that\'s never a bad thing! Hope to see you soon. Love, Ramesh
As we left the catacombs, we thought Benadrix was struck ill.  He collapsed and his breathing came in short gasps. He quickly recovered and told us he had a vision, he could not remember much, but he said he felt anger and saw red. He also thought that he may have glimpsed a dragon. These visions that guide my new friend interest me, I was tought by my dwarven friends the importance of follwoing my own will, but even they hope for visions from Moradin to guide them. How different is that from the guidance of the Mind Flayers? I will not worry myself with it, for now these strange events surrounding Harken are enough. We went to the Old Cliffside Brewery on our return to town, as we had assume we found Old Keller there along with Orek Gernsan, the ranger who we had met was not present.  Both men seemed suprised to see us walk through the door.  We told them how we had routed the goblins, and what we had found in the catacombs, and more importnatnly to Gernsan what we didn\'t find, his shipments.  Overjoyed and true to his word, Keller paied us the 100 gold promised us the night before.   We spent some time talking to Keller, trying to gather as much information as we could.  So far no villagers have gone missing, and when we told him that the goblins were tied th the Bloodreavers he was not supprised.  It appears Chieg Krand and his Bloodreavers make their home north of Harken, and have been less than desirable neighbors.   We retired to the Inn for the evening.  Aunt Nonie was as supprised to see us return alive as Keller and Gernsan were, she had held our rooms for us, but not her breath.  Before retiering for the evening we agreed once more that we would return to the catacombs in the morning. After a hearty breakfast (for my companions) we hea,\'ed out to the catacombs, there was no end to the teasing of Benadrix and his feat of streangth with the statue and his inablilty to break down a wooden door.  As we approched the catacombs, two goblins were exiting.  When they saw us they broke for the woods.  We went to make chace but from the forrest exploded a huge black dog, and almost as quickly it burst into smoke.  Moments after the dog vanished an elf woman appeared fromt he brush.  She asked if we had seen a man go this way, she seemed very confused.  We tried to explain to her that the only thing we had going this direction was the dog who dissapeared, but taht we too were on the chase, after two goblins.   She contenued to insist a man had gon this way, and kept repeating a name\'Garrek Esh.\' After a few minutes of trying we callemd the elf down, and attempted to get her story one more time.  Her name is Cellence, and she is from Sigil the city of portals.  The man she is perusing, this Garrek, has escaped from some sort of prison she called the Harbinger House.  Most of this was lost to me, I had never heard of any of these places, but Marrek seemed to know a little.  His reaction to hearing she came from Sidgil was one of suprise, his knowlegd of it seemed to mosty come from children\'s stories he was told while growing up.  Knowing the magic nature of Sigil Marrek suggested Cellence should make her way to Thunderspire, a nearby city ruled by wizards.  Cellence asked to accompany us until she found her bearings in our world, aparently taking the portals out of Sidgil is very disorenting. Cellence accompanied us into the catacombs, there was no more signs of goblin activity.  We made our way into the chamber with the pit and locked door.  After a night of rest Gnasc was able to pick the lock on the door.  Inside we found a magic sword, being two handed it was deemed appropreat for Benadrix to carry it.  Perhaps it will serve as a reminder to him next time that his feats of strength should be resurved for locked doors rather than pushing statues into pits.  We removed the debre blocking the other door and followed it into a large underground cavern with a lake in the mi,\'le.   We were supprised by some bats, and it took us a moment to gather our witts.  Like clockwork the four of us fell into battle, Cellence must have been shaken from her trip through the portal because her magic seemed to escape her.  As we were about to dispach the final bat, it dove into the lake.   The surface of the lake began to bubble up and a black dragon rose from its depths.  It wasted no time shrowding itself in darkness and attacking.  While most of us stood still struck with fear, the faithful Gnasc (who\'s scarred body is proof he has seen far worse than a dragon) tried to snap us out of it, only Marrek responded.  The fight with the dragon was tough, it moved around the lake, retreating to the depths at times.  Once during the fight I thought I was finnished but Marrek lept between me and the dragon, scoring a devistating blow to the beast and saving my life.  I did not have time to think about it in the moment, but Cellence must have felt bad during the fight, the neasuea of the portal was still effecting her ability to weild magic.  Marrek delt the killing blow to the dragon, and not a moment too soon, I fear had the fight lasted any longer we all would have perished. In a small cave in the back we found the stolen shipments of Ale from the Clifside Brewery along with a chest containing a gem and a magic dagger.  One of the casks was busted open, fromt he inside.  The remenants of a black dragon\'s egg was inside this cask, along with a scroll written in Draconic.  It read:\'To the vigorous soldier and noble friend Armos Kamroth, I send my most sincere greetings in the name of Tiamat. May you continue in good health and good spirits, most reverend and divinely favored Lord and may my humble gift provide you some aid in your endeavors.\'We returned to the Cliffside Brewery with the remaining casks of Ale and more than a few questions for Orek Gernsan.  After a bit of questiong it was clear he did not know about the dragon, and he suggested we seek Old keller to help us gain an audience with Baron Stockmer.  We found Keller at Aunt Nonie\'s, and he agreed to set a meeting for the morning. We setteled in for the night, only to be awaken by the sounds of fighting outside and the glow of fire through our windows.  Arming ourselves we rushed outside to help where we could.  Two bugbears and a handfull of hobgoblins were in the town square, and set upon us as we exited the inn.   It was a gruling fight, the aches from the battle with the dragons were still fresh, just when we thought we had the square cleaned out more of the goblinkin poured into the square.  Benadrix and I were exausted but stood to face the Sub Commander as our friends dispatched the remaining archers.  Merrek acted quickly again this fight and saved Benadrix from sure death at the point of an arrow, this allowed Benadrix to help me finish the Sub Commander.  Even at the end of the battle the night was not won, much of the town was on fire, and the goblins had taken some of the townsfolk prisoner. We found a letter ordering the torching of the town, on the Sub Commander, and that the chared bodies of the dead were to be brought to Thunderspire.  Marrek claime the Commanders sword, clearly a magical weapon.   When the fires were out, we reited back to the inn where Old Keller was waiting for us.  He thanked us again for saving the town and presented me with his shield from his younger days, it is covered in Dwarven and Draconic runes and he explained that it will protect me as well as my allies.  Exausted we headed back to our rooms, the meeting with Baron Stockmer tomorrow seems like an eternity away. Your friend, 148 Marekk Lagonn stood at a crossroads. The Old Kings Road cut through the Nentir Valley. It was crisscrossed by smaller trade routes and mountain paths. It was at one of these intersections that Marekk stood now. His father\'s sword felt heavy at his waist as he studied the road in front of him. He had left the place of his birth nearly a year ago after making every effort to restore his family\'s name. Had he given up? Should he have tired harder? Was his father looking down on him now and shaking his head in shame as the last of the Lagonn line wandered the world, lost in more ways than one? Marekk sighed and looked to his trusted companion. The Gnoll stood a few yards back studying the dense forest on either side of the road. Gnasc smelled something in the woods that much he was sure of. The trees were no doubt full of animals but this scent was different, strange. He lifted his massive head and straightened his long ears, straining to hear something. Since Marekk had freed him from that slaving camp he had followed the human on his journey. He seemed to have no clear destination in mind but that didn\'t bother Gnasc. The man had risked his life to save him from a life of slavery, and Gnasc owed him something. He wasn\'t sure exactly what, but he was determined to follow Marekk until his debt was paid. A branch broke in the woods to the east and Gnasc\'s head snapped up in that direction. Marrek\'s hand shot to his sword handle as he also reacted to the noise. 148 stood in the trees watching the strangers. He\'d heard them coming and had chosen to hide along side the road and wait for them to pass. But they hadn\'t passed. The human and his Gnoll had just stopped at the crossroads. The man seemed to be trying to decide which direction to go next. It was a simple situation and not an uncommon problem, unless you happen to be a magically animated mechanical construct. 148 had never had never known what it was like to choose a path. He was built to serve and fight for his master and that\'s exactly what he did. Even after being rescued and repaired by dwarves who told him he was now free he still didn\'t fully understand the concept. They had taken him to the Old King\'s road and told him to go off and choose his own life. He had simply followed the road with mechanical precision unsure what it meant to choose. Now he sat in the woods watching this human survey the roads ahead of him and he was fascinated. What was going in on in his head? His massive frame shifted in the wet ground and a twig snapped under his weight. When he looked back to the road the human was staring directly at 148, his hand on his sword and the Gnoll seemed to have vanished. Marekk was surprised to see a Warforged emerge from the tree line. The massive war machine walked slowly from the woods his hands raised in the universal symbol of peace. The irony was not wasted on him. He relaxed his sword arm but left his hand resting on the hilt. Gnasc appeared from the shadows behind him. No matter how many times he saw the Gnoll pull this trick it never ceased to impress him. He was just about to ask the machine what exactly he was doing hiding in the woods when he heard a deep laugh from just up the road. Benadrix walked the Old Kings Road completely content. He had been chosen! Thank Kord he had been chosen and his destiny had been made clear. A paladin might serve his entire life and never receive such a profound vision. Kord had showed him the village of Harken and let him know that his future started there. He\'d meet a group of travelers on the Old Kings road and together they would go to Harken. as he crested a hill he saw a strange group ahead of him. A human, a Warforged and a Gnoll all arranged in what looked like a standoff. He laughed as he approached them, surely these were the companions Kord had shown him! Marekk watched as the Dragonborn approached their group. He walked right between him and the machine without breaking his swift stride. He guessed that the beast was smiling but the rows of razor sharp teeth made him uneasy. The Dragoborn continued on down road. Without even looking back he said in heavily accented common\'What are you all waiting for, Harken is this way!\'The warforged looked at the Human and the Gnoll and then walked off after the Dragonborn. Marekk and Gnasc shared a look. This was simply too strange, they had to find out what was going on. Marekk straightened up, adjusted his armor and walked off after the Dragonborn. He looked up at the sky. The horizon was crowded with heavy black clouds. A storm was coming. After a cold day in the rain we came across Harken Village. Looking to warm up and escape the rain we asked for directions to the local pub. We were directed to The Old Cliffside Brewery, and no sooner had we sat down than we were approached by an old dwarf named Keller. Old Keller told us about how the village was being terrorised by a band of goblins, and asked if we could help. He seemed truly concerned, and when it was clear he was speaking for the whole town when he offered us 25 gold each to help rid the town of these goblin raiders. Benadrix tried to squeeze some more gold out of him but Keller said the best he could do is the 25 gold and free food and lodging while we were in town. Marrek agreed first, and predictably Gnasc was quick to agree too. When I agreed that I would help too I was afraid Benadrix would part ways and our short friendship would be over but he too agreed to help the village, but only after he was given a room and a nights rest. Old Keller took us to the only inn in town, Aunt Nonnie\'s . Keller secured us four rooms, and Aunt Nonnie was clear that it was costing her 5 silver apiece but she was happy to do so if we could rid the town of the goblins. Not needing to sleep I thought about just asking for the silver but I didn\'t want to cause any problems within our fledgling group. Aunt Nonnie seemed empty except for the four of us so we headed back over to the Old Cliffside Brewery to see if we could gather any more information on these raids. When we entered the pub this time Gnasc noticed an elf in the corner who was spending a little more time looking at us than anyone else in the room. He was also equipped much differently than the locals, with a bow and two fine swords my guess is that he is a ranger. We approached him, thinking he may know more about these goblins than others. He was not very interested in talking and in fact tried to turn use away from his table, until Benadrix convinced him otherwise. If he knew anything he did not let on, talking to him was almost as productive as talking to a wall, even after Marrek bought him a drink. After a few fruitless minutes of trying to talk to him, Marrek went to talk to Old Keller and the bartender, Orek Gernsan . It turns out that the Cliffside Brewery has been hit hard by these raiders, about half of the shipments to neighboring towns have been hit. Gernsan asked us to bring back any of these lost shipments that we may find. After a restful night in the inn, Old Keller took us to the entrance of the catacombs that he believed the goblins were hiding out in. Gnasc snuck in first, I am still amazed at how stealthy he is for being even bigger than me, and checked the room. There were three goblins seated around a table. Eager to prove myself to my friends I rushed in, with them right behind me. We had a bit of a rough fight, especially after two more goblins appeared from the shadows. While it may not have been the prettiest fight we were able to defeat our foes and after searching the room we also found a pouch with 40 gold inside. After a short rest, we followed another hallway where we found some more goblins, one who seemed to have just finished up some kind of ritual. Gnasc was not able to sneak in on this group of goblins. The Hexer in the back of the room summoned some rats, who launched themselves with reckless abandon at us. Benadrix and I quickly tried to make our way to the Hexer thinking he would be the biggest threat in the room, but before we could reach him he summoned two large fire beatles , and Gnasc and Marrek were separated from us by them. We fought hard, and did much better than the previous battle. Though he was bloodied we were unable to stop the Hexer from escaping through a door to another room. Taking a moment to gather ourselves we searched the room, and I found a large gem in the bottom of the brazier. The door the Hexer went through opened up to a large room with a vicious looking statue overlooking a large pit in the floor. There was a large Dire Wolf behind an iron grate, with two goblins standing guard near it. One of them too close to a leaver that most certainly would set the Dire Wolf free. The Hexer was across the room, and there was another even more ornately dressed goblin across the pit from us along with a smaller wolf. There were also quite a few goblins in the room as well. Early on in the fight I was magically pulled into the pit by the Warcaster , and shortly after that Marrek was also dropped into the pit. I helped him escape, and when I managed to climb out my friends had cleared much of the room, and to my relief the Dire Wolf was still caged. I was able to finish off the Warcaster , but the Hexer , while still recovering from our last battle still put up a good fight. He was able to pull the lever to free the Dire Wolf just before he died. The Dire Wolf was in a frenzy by the time the gate opened, but it was so bloodthirsty that it did not put up much of a fight. I felt bad for having to kill the Dire Wolf, but it was so worked up having been caged by those goblins we did not have a choice. We discovered a locked door and while Marrek , Gnasc , and I struggled with it, Benadrix busied himself with pushing the statue into the pit. We were unable to open the door, but we did find a crued map of Harken on the Warcaster with the Brewery marked, along with the estate of Baron Stockmer . There was also a note about capturing villagers for slaves. There was a second door blocked by lots of rubble, clearly done by the goblins. While interested in the door, we were exhausted from the fights and thought it best to warn the town of what we found. We were unable to find any of Gernsan\'s shipments, but perhaps they are behind the locked door. I am also interested to find out what has the goblins so scared they would block off the door in the last room. I also need to learn more about Baron Stockmer . Also after spending the first years of my life in something like slavery I will not let any of these villagers be subjected to that, I only hope my new friends feel as strongly about this. Your Friend, 148
On April 11th, a show that may well end up being the next great television drama will debut on HBO. I have written about Treme in the past, but in case you have not paid attention, here is the dealio: Treme, named after the Faubourg Tremé neighborhood in the French Quarter, is set in post-Katrina New Orleans and looks at the situation through the eyes of the jazz musicians. The cast is damn impressive and features Simon vets Mellisa Leo ( Det. Sgt. Kay Howard in Homicide: Life on the Streets), The Wire\'s Clarke Peters (THE WIRE), Wendell Pierce (Also from THE WIRE) and Khandi Alexander (THE CORNER) as well as John Goodman, Steve Zahn and Kim Dickens. Here is the new trailer to get you ready. Trailer With season one barely over, word comes that there will be a change in the cast for season two. Marsha Thomason will be returning as FBI agent Diana Lancing, the character she played in the series pilot. Marsha has previously appeared on LOST and LAS VEGAS. As she comes, Natalie Morales will be leaving. Natalie played agent Lauren Cruz in throughout the season, but often in a minor capacity. Natalie will be staying within the NBC/Uni family as she joins the NBC comedy PARKS AND RECREATION. Season two begins this summer. Good news for fans of Victor Gischler : Director Sean Byrne is on board for the planned film of of the very cool GO-GO GIRLS OF THE APOCALYPSE. Mortimer Tate was a recently divorced insurance salesman when he holed up in a cave on top of a mountain in Tennessee and rode out the end of the world. Go-Go Girls of the Apocalypse begins nine years later, when he emerges into a bizarre landscape filled with hollow reminders of an America that no longer exists. The highways are lined with abandoned automobiles; electricity is generated by indentured servants pedaling stationary bicycles. What little civilization remains revolves around Joey Armage,\'on\'s Sassy A-Go-Go strip clubs, where the beer is cold, the lap dancers are hot, and the bouncers are armed with M16s. Accompanied by his cowboy sidekick Buffalo Bill, the gorgeous stripper Sheila, and the mountain man Ted, Mortimer journeys to the lost city of Atlanta -- and a showdown that might determine the fate of humanity. Byrnes\'feature film debut, THE LOVED ONES, won the Midnight Madness Audience Award at the Toronto Film Festival and generated quite a buzz in the film world. Prior to THE LOVED ONES, he directed a number of shorts and has been compared to a young Sam Rami. That is a hell of a compliment. Check out this interview with Twitch.com . I have always enjoyed Victor\'s work, but GO-GO GIRLS rocked mightily and was one of my favorite books of 2008. It kicks ass and is a lot of fun. If you have not picked it up, do yourself a favor and get a copy right now! HBO has announced that season three of TRUE BLOOD will begin SUNDAY, JUNE 13 at 9:00 p.m. (ET/PT). Mill Creek Entertainment Release date: March 9, 2010 MSRP: $14.98 Runtime: 20 episodes, 720 minutes, 4 discs Silk Stalkings is another Stephen J. Cannell-created series previously released on DVD by Anchor Bay, discontinued, and now re-released by Mill Creek. First aired in 1991 as part of CBS\'s Crimetime After Primetime lineup, the show focused on two partners in the West Palm Beach, Florida PD assigned to sexually-based crimes of passion. As its timeslot and title suggest, the show was more risqu&eacute; than much of network TV at the time, but seems tame compared to today\'s fare. While there was a lot of flash, co-stars Mitzi Kapture and Rob Estes had more substance in their performances than you might expect. Kapture\'s Rita Lee Lance was beautiful, but also driven by a brain aneurysm that plagued her with headaches and threatened to burst anytime. Estes\'s Chris Lorenzo was more casual on the surface, but a dependable partner and friend to Rita. Both actors could pull off the show\'s mix of saucy and serious dialogue. When Crimetime After Primetime was cancelled in 1993, Silk Stalkings moved to USA Network, where it ran until 1999 with new partners rotating in a la Law &amp; Order—a testament to the strength of its premise. I have a soft spot for first seasons and enjoyed revisiting the show as first conceived. The first season also features Ben Vereen as Chris and Rita\'s captain and Danny Gans as medical examiner Roger. This set has no extras and is packaged in inconvenient, flimsy paper-and-cellophane sleeves, but as with all Mill Creek sets, the $14.98 price is the real draw. --Gerald So With just a month to go before shooting, the cast for MILDRED PIERCE is starting to fill out. With more names coming out this last week, I thought this would be a good time to take a look at who is who so far: Kate Winslet: The title character. Mildred Pierce had gorgeous legs, a way with a skillet, and a bone-deep core of toughness. She used those attributes to survive a divorce and poverty and to claw her way out of the lower mi,\'le class. But Mildred also had two weaknesses: a yen for shiftless men, and an unreasoning devotion to a monstrous daughter. (Joan Crawford in the original). Do I really need to talk about Kate? Evan Rachel Wood: Veda, the aforementioned monstrous daughter. Despite Mildred\'s attempts to provide a better life for her, Vera wants more and will do almost anything to get what she feels she deserves. (Ann Blyth). Wood played Rourke\'s daughter in THE WRESTLER and was quite good in THE UPSIDE OF ANGER. Guy Pearce: Monte Beragon, the wealthy playboy that eventually becomes Mildred\'s second husband. Almost immediately, we learn that things don\'t end too well for him. (Zachary Scott). Pearce is best known for L.A. CONFIDENTIAL and MEMENTO and recently appeared in THE HURT LOCKER. Brian F. O\'Byrne: Bert Pierce, Mildred\'s first husbamd, after he loses his job, Mildred leaves in hopes of finding a better life (Bruce Bennett). O\'Bryne can currently be seen as Aaron Stark on FlashForward and was Colin on BROTHERHOOD. James LeGros: Wally Fay, Bert\'s former business partner (Jack Carson). LeGros was recently seen as Dr. Dan Harris in MERCY and also had regular roles in ALLY MCBEAL and SLEEPER CELL. He also played Raylan Givens in Elmore Leonard\'s PRONTO on Showtime. Melissa Leo is Ida Corwin, Mildred\'s friend (Eve Arden). Leo was nominated for an Oscar for her performance in FROZEN RIVER and will be in the upcoming David Simon series TREME on HBO. Morgan Turner: Veda, younger but still a wretched creature. To,\' Haynes co-wrote the screenplay and will be directing. He wrote and directed 2002\'s acclaimed FAR FROM HEAVEN (which got him an Oscar nomination). I want to open this up with the disclosure that I am not a fan of the Stargate franchise. I\'m not saying I don\'t like, I\'m saying I don\'t know it or watch it. I saw the original movie and really enjoyed it. I\'ve seen a few episodes of the two show, Stargate and Stargate Atlantis and it didn\'t really move me one way or the other. Another Sci Fi show to watch to kill time in a pleasant enough way. Ol\' Jeremy asked if I was interested in this and the name Robert Carlyle got my attention. I\'ll watch anything he does, and so far I\'ve enjoyed all his work. So, quick Stargate rundown. Mankind discover gateways to other worlds put here by a group they call the Ancients. Being mankind we start to explore going to other worlds. Now you know all you need to to watch this. A group called Icarus is on a planet with a very powerful gate. To access an as yet unreachable destination they need help cracking a code. They recruit a genius who lives with Mom and plays video games all day. They crack the code just as the location of the group is under attack. Most people shoot to a ship and back to earth, however a smaller group of civilians and military go through the gateway and land a ship called the Destiny. New mission, find a way home. They can communicate with Earth through tech originating with the Ancients that lets them swap bodies, however they are mostly on their own. They need to find food and water and keep the ship running. Carlyle plays a scientist(Dr, Nicholas Rush) who is obsessed with the ship and really cares about nothing else. Elli Wallace is the young genius who is just fascinated by it all, but also the most interesting as he is not influenced by either faction wanting to control the tech. Everett Yong is in charge, but it\'s shaky at best. Minng Na plays a human resources person who is representing an oversight group with their own agendas. other layers include various military and civilan folks who work together to try and get home. Lou Diamond Phillips is a Colnol Telford who was supposed to be in charge of a team ready for this mission instead of the rag tag team actually on the ship. He a,\'s a wonderful dynamic to the cast. Even Richard Dean Anderson from the original series has a role here and it really ties it together nicely. I love the cast with one exception. Ming Na is a crappy actress. I couldn\'t stand her on ER and I don\'t like her here. She over does movements and facial expressions and always looks pissed off. All the other people on the show seem natural in their roles, she seems to over think it and it feels false. I hope they kill her off in a nasty fashion. They even a,\'ed a lesbian element to her character which really does nothing other than try to be hip. Kill her off. Other than that one character I love this show. It has elements of various other sci fi things I\'ve seen and enjoyed but it is also very character driven and well plotted. Whether you are a fan of Stargate or not I think this is a shoe worth checking out. Season 1.0 was a lot of fun and the DVD set was over faster than I would have liked. I\'ll be watching all the rest as soon as they come out. So end result: I love everything about the show except for one actress. I recommend this. Buy Stargate SG-U: 1.0 Season 1.5 comes back on the air April 2nd. When I heard the news that the cast was changing I was mad. I love Vincent D\'Onofrio and Kathryn Erbe on the show and after 8 seasons i want more. I questioned what the Hell they were thinking. I\'ve seen the first two episodes of Season 9 and I have to say the send off was perfect. LOYALTY part one and two were really something special and on the strength of these two episodes I think the show will still be a favorite. Something weird is going on with their Captain (Eric Bogosian) and Goren and Eames are not going to let it it sit. Before long things get crazy with the international implications, FBI and the upper brass in NYPD all tangling things up. I don\'t want to give anything away plot wise, but the title of the shows, LOYALTY is right on. Goldblum is great, I like his new partner played by Saffron Burrows (Boston Legal) a lot as the new Detective from Chicago. Don\'t worry, it looks ike Law and Order Criminal Intent will still be a great show, and I for one, can\'t wait to keep watching. Look for it on TUESDAY March 30th on USA Network
As you can see, the enclosed blog post has been around far awhile. It has been typed and ready to go for more than a month, and was waiting for the rest of the thought to finish it off. I have done little so far this year but run and hide. I am having a hard time emotionally, but am not wasting time just whining about it. True, running from a problem does not lead to solving anything, but on the other hand neither does whining. My basic time fillers have been reading, 15 books since January l; running up the hill to the chapel, usually two to three times a day, four or five days a week; and last but not least, countless hours mopping, waxing and buffing floors. I have not heard from my brother, and at this point it seems fairly clear that he will not be writing to me at all. I have also lost all hope that any of my worldly possessions, tools, clothes, etc. will be available to me when I get out. It would appear to me that all I have to look forward to upon my release is what I take with me from here. As far as human contact goes at this point it is down to Abby and you. I guess this is as low as I can get so I better start the rebuilding phase soon! I have plenty to say, I need to let it all out and see what develops. I am wondering if the blog is really the place to write the true inside prison story. Oh yes, plenty of mano on mano sex, gambling away all my money, beating up on the weaker ones here, etc. Ki,\'ing. Maybe we could go the taxpayer report route. How about how all the overweight staff members continue to belly up to the inmate food bar and stuff themselves at taxpayer expense? Okay just a little bitterness. I just caught a line in the NY Post about Amy Fisher raising money for Haiti by going nude at some Long Island strip club or something. Apparently this mother of three and product of NY State Department of Corrections is embarking on a cross county strip club trip to promote her personal porn web site. I did read her memoir of her time in the system that includes at least two or three rapes from prison guards. One strange thing in my own life is for some reason I continue to receive the NY Times. I am not sure if perhaps my brother has just not figured out yet that it is going on Mom\'s charge card or what. I have not heard from my brother since his one letter, and I think I sent you a copy of my response. I did send a Christmas card to mom, but have received nothing from them. Ironically the NY Times is still coming and I can tell from the mailing labels when the next payment is due. It is every four weeks. I wonder if Bill has figured out that it is being billed to mom\'s credit card or not. I could write and say okay instead of the paper send me the cash, but to be honest while I know it is expensive, it provides a vital link to a world outside that gives me a little hope for the future. Not to mention the little nuggets I get to share with others. For example did you catch the story around Thanksgiving about the drama camp that was performing in the Macy\'s Parade? I know you said you discontinued you daily newspaper delivery, but do you catch it online? The title of the article is around here somewhere on a single piece of paper for me to tell you and I do not know where the note is now. I thought it might be something to look into for your creative non hockey playing son. Hey I found the note. The article was in the 11/20/09 edition.\'Happy Campers Command Stage in Macy\'s Parade.\'The name of the camp is Stagedoor Manor Theatre Camp. Not sure if it would be something of interest, but appearing in the Macy\'s parade is not too shabby a place to be. Time is fleeting, and I must end this typing session. I could try to continue by hand but it would quickly become unreadable. Hopefully I will get some more sleep, and continue this letter to you. Then I could easily take the issues in this letter and make plenty of blog material. The one true hope I have still of being of some use to at the least reinforce my sense of self and my humanity, and maybe still, a small but powerful, community of people that can take some part in my future existence. You are, as always, a powerful anchor in my life. I hope you are not being tossed around too badly out there in the real world. I know you too have pressures and demands on your time, and look forward to any part of that time you can share with me. I have even mentioned the missing night\'s sleep. I have become the sole keeper of the floors for the day area and much of the dorm. Yeah we allegedly have porters, but this is one dorm where porters get away with not doing their jobs. More on this to follow. But for the last four or five months I have been responsible for mopping up the day area after 11:30 PM. Then starting in November that included stripping the floors, and now I have put over eight coats of wax on them. This Sunday evening I decided to not only mop the floors but do some buffing and rewaxing too. Just mopping the floor usually involves at least two or three changes of the water in the buckets. One for the soap, one to rinse. So after doing a super special mop job I start using the high speed buffing machines to both remove some of the scratches and put a shine back on the floor. I am doing this work all by myself, which is actually a good thing, while all the other inmates sleep. I finish up around 6:30 AM Monday morning, just in time to make me a bowl of oatmeal and start laying the first three coats of wax in the dorm area. This takes me till about 12:00 noon, and then I have lunch which was another gift of venison, and up to the chapel I go both at 3:00 and again at 7:00 PM for two hours each time to work on the clerk stuff and computer program I am trying to do in Excel, which is a trip since there are no help files installed. But what I can do is record macros, which are shown in Visual Basic, and try to edit them into workable code. I arrived back at the dorm around 9:00 PM and napped for about 90 minutes, and was back up at 11 PM to mop the floors. I got to bed around 1:00 AM this morning, but was up at 7:00 AM to put more wax on the floors. Today we ended having our inmates move out of the dorm, and as a result a couple guys got to move into single cubes from the double cubes, and then we had a few new guys come in. So this high tech operation prohibited me from waxing today. I need to get about eight coats of wax to have the floor really shine. So instead of trying to catch up on my sleep, I ended up heading up the hill to the Chapel at 9:00, 12:30, and 3:00. I finally arrived back at the dorm at 5:00, and around 6:30 was chowing down with a half pound of pasta with octopus tomato sauce. By the way since I have eliminated most of the comfort/munchie type foods from my diet I am down to 206 since September when I was pushing 225! I tried to disappear for a bit and take a nap but that did not work. So I have pulled out the typewriter and penned this opus to you. As I think I have mentioned to you, Ray has sort of become an adoptive son to me. Heck my oldest son is older than he is. Anyhow, for the last couple of months, we have prepared and eaten at least one meal a day together. Ray is extremely conflicted about receiving financial support from his family, but they are certainly able to provide it. I need to tell you some of the stories Ray has told me, to let you get a clearer picture of his life. One recent night, he sought me out to talk after getting an emotionally conflicted call from his adoptive mom. His Bio mom is apparently a real jerk. One note is of course I have no outside collaboration which a,\'s a layer of mystery to this whole thing. So Ray tells me it is not fair, I have it all together as to how to handle life, and his life is in total chaos. Ray\'s payroll from the mess hall has varied from $14 to $28 every two weeks, so once we decide on the meals for the next two weeks, he would spend most of his money, and I would pick up the rest. In a,\'ition I would still get my three boxes of oatmeal, ten packets in each. I use two at a time, and two jars of peanut butter plus two loaves of wheat bread for my lunch. The meals would be pasta or bean dishes. The point is that now with my funds all but gone, he still has not gotten around to getting in any funds, and while there are a few specific amounts he owes me, it was always assumed that at some point in the near future, he would become the larger contributor. Or not. That is what I deal with: is he for real in seeking out my wisdom and support, or is he a fine tuned con man who has managed to eat well for the last few months at my expanse? It is hard to tell. Yes, I could choose to not share my resources with others, but that is not who I am. I laugh when I tell others that did not realize when I moved into my cube that it was also the condiment bar for the dorm. One inmate for instance, who is leaving in six weeks, gets monthly packages from home, full $55 buys from commissary, yet he ask me for ketchup to dress up his food bowl. Another inmate that works in the kitchen and has access to all sorts of condiments also asks me for ketchup etc. to dress up the burgers and things he takes back from the mess hall. Another inmate just tonight said he needs my help. he apparently did something dumb at work in the mess hall and ended up getting a ticket. One other golden tidbit Ray dropped at dinner tonight was that Darnell and another inmate that lives in our dorm were caught fucking around in a back area of the mess hall. The officer that caught them is the one that Ray said did not want me working there. As a result the one inmate lost his job, but it looks like no penalty against Darnell. For the record, Darnell is 240 pounds of solid muscle. When I asked Ray if he meant fucking around in the sexual sense as opposed to a more physical horseplay, but also prohibited behavior, he said the sexual. So go figure that one out. In other words, the fucking around was at least consensual, but at worst, Darnell was the aggressor. Mind you, the truth is such a hard thing to find out around here. I do not know who or what is the truth. Although Mark, heretofore the unmentioned inmate, did lose his job in the mess hall, the really strange part is that Mark is about 80 days from the door. Go figure. So I am not sure if I have mentioned Darnell Biggins to you before. He is the inmate clerk in the mess hall, and in the past has made my life miserable, and made it tough for me to find time to work on the computer once they had taken my personal machine from me. Today I see him up at the chapel and I happen to mention the $2.00 and change missing from my pay. He says that should not be. I further mention that it appears they have switched my job number, which governs the normal hours I get paid, and the rate. He claims he did not know that it was switched. It has been going on for over six weeks, and I know he personally fills out the preprinted time sheets with all the hours for each of the 100 plus inmates listed. Since I used to be in a group of six or so inmates listed on their own page, and am now on the regular list with about 65 other inmates, it would be tough to miss. He is either stupid, or lying to me. I happened to mention to Ray (Carlton) that I talked to Biggins, and that Biggins said the reason I was still not working was that two staff people did not want me around. One is an officer, the other, one of the civilian cooks. Ray mentions no, it is another one of the officers down there that does not want me there. Ironically, all of the people mentioned have been there for a while and while I might not be their best friend, I was working with them in the past. The point is that I do not know how much of what Darnell -- oops, so used to staff people calling inmates by their last name -- is saying is possibly the truth, nor what Ray says is the whole story either. It still amazes me not only that any staff person is willing to look the great gift of my services in the mouth, and how little power John Black, the food service manager has over what goes on in the area he is responsible for. Are you able to follow any of this, or do you even care? I am not sure how much of this I really want you to write back about, but if you want better (more) detail just ask. I would rather you not mention specific questions just in case your letter does get read on the way in. My life of late has been little more than a downward spiral. As I was taught way back when,\'Cheer up I says things could be worse.\'Sure enough I cheered up and they got worse! You last letter started off with a complaint of lack of letters on my side. I sent two letters in a few days time, and then silence. Okay I know from your Christmas card, you were fighting some bronchitis (why did you wait to go to doctor!) and it was the busy Christmas season so I thought I might hear from you by now. Alas, the old wait for tomorrow trick has now seen twelve days pass. So I am writing now. I am wondering if I put too many requests in my last letters and you are pissed off? I thought I had told you if you ever feel the requests are too much, skip them. There was the question posed by the person about having me write more about the inside perspective of prison. I think I have also sent you a copy of the letter I finally sent back to my brother. So I thought there should have been something there to write back to me about. If not, then hopefully something in this missal will tickle your fancy. I hope so; certainly my life has not had many tickles in it. About the only ray of sunshine in my life has been Abby, and she surprised me with a bunch of books that arrived here at the end of last month! Boy do I remember the frequent, numerous and much awaited book drops you used to make. I no sooner get back from the package room and three or four inmates are already at my bunk wanting to see what titles I got in. One reason I am writing now, 8.15 PM on Tuesday, is I received my bi-weekly commissary sheet today upon my return from the chapel. For the first time in many years I only have $55.20 in my account. My pay for my no-show job has been adjusted downward to $13.30 per week. My last three commissary buys were for $76.57, $73.85 and $64.37. So with only $13.30 coming in, things are looking really depressing. I am looking at my handwritten letter. Either there is another letter or perhaps I misdated that one. No, in all likelihood my funk has led to delusional thinking that I am writing more often to you than I am. Boy that is a surprise. I just received a letter from Abby, and she ended up spending a few days in two different hospitals to be diagnosed as having severe stomach problems apparently related to the loss of proper nerve functioning related to lifelong battle with diabetes. The medicine they are giving her is only a stopgap measure, as you are not supposed to take it for more than three months. She went to a local hospital over the weekend only to end up being transferred to a major medical center within the area. I do not know if you care but she lives in a town apparently in the mi,\'le of nowhere, and the nearest hospital can only handle more mundane ills so she was transferred by ambulance to the larger facility. I still have not heard from my brother, or even my brother acting as the letter writer for my mother. It appears at this point that I am never again going to be able to have a two way communication with Mom. From the\'cheer up things could be worse\'department, well sure enough I cheered up and they got worse. I received my monthly statement today and it turns out for some unknown reason my weekly $15.20 pay from my mess hall job had now been reduced to $13.30 a week. On the one hand I should be grateful I have been kept on the payroll without doing any work, but on the other hand, if I am supposed to be paid x amount, then pay me that. I have to get my ass in gear and answer with more detail the issues I raised on my earlier letter. Ray and I had a pound or so of venison sausage today in a tomato sauce with a pound of pasta, 1/2 each. There was some extra sauce which is about to have two cans of beans a,\'ed to it and with a sleeve of saltines become a late supper. It is my second known encounter with deer meat and I have to admit it is pretty good. Of course since it has been years since I have had anything that resembles red meat, this is certainly a treat. Our regular officer has been off the past two days, (Wednesday-Thursday) and will be back tomorrow so I will probably be doing a whole bunch of floor scrubbing and waxing. Also the 11 PM to 7 AM regular guy is back in a few hours after his two days off so I will probably be up till 3 or 4 am doing stuff in the day area too. I did get a letter off tonight to Jerry in California, so I will see if that pans out to another person to reach out to. Oh wait a MINUTE there was another letter which included my response to my brother! My typing without proofing leaves something to be desired I know. But I figured a few typos are better than no letter at all. I just do not have the patience at this point to proof and retype a letter I am struggling a bit. It seems I am a positive supportive presence in Ray\'s life and Abby makes a comment about how I write to her more than her son John and she wants me to write more, that once in a while I need a place to go to recharge my batteries. That place/person just does not exist right now. On the one hand I want to yell at the powers to be that hey you let me do all that great programming for you for six plus months, you are still using it, I got little benefit for the value you received, and yet you now treat me like a black sheep of the family. Please let me do what I am good at. Let me build up my own self esteem since everything else around here is based on the premise that we can tear it all apart. So I hope you had a good holiday, I guess you had a few off, and now it is time to think about back to work. So now that you have gotten two letters this week, I am going to see if I can get some more out to you on Sunday evening.
No real analysis here, but I\'d like to draw your attention to this recent article by Kenneth Chang in the New York Times about recent work that might shed light on the very early earth. I am highlighting the article both because it deals with geochronology (U-Pb zircon geochronology to be exact), and because it is a rare article dealing explicitly with geology; not modern climate change or some geoscience themed hazard, but straight up geology. The article also has some good quotes from some of the grand high mucky mucks of geology including Mark Harrison, John Valley, and Norm Sleep. I\'ve seen a talk version of some of this data before, and when I get into my office tomorrow I\'ll check out the Nature paper as well and try to comment, although in all honesty I seriously doubt I\'d come up with much more insightful than Professors Harrison, Valley, Sleep, and Mojzsis.In consideration of self promotion, if you\'d like some background on geochronology to help with the NY Times article, check out this earlier post of mine, or any of the background geology posts I have listed on my sidebar.
Nonprofit organizations—and their staff/boards—which are part of the institutional Catholic Church should clearly support the teachings of the Church, just as employees/board members of any nonprofit have to be supportive of the mission of the nonprofit they serve. This story from the Washington Post reports on the issue. An excerpt. \'Shortly after imposing limits on spousal health benefits for employees, Catholic Charities of Washington has begun requiring new employees to promise they will not\'violate the principles or tenets\'of the church. \'That language was a,\'ed March 3 to a hiring letter that new employees are required to sign, according to spokesman Erik Salmi. He said the move did not reflect a policy change because employees have been told during training that the organization is Catholic in more than name. \'Catholic Charities, one of the region\'s largest nonprofit organizations, has been trying to develop a way to continue its multimillion-dollar social service partnerships with the District while not recognizing the city\'s same-sex marriage law, which the D.C.

That being said, this example reported by the Washington Post , might not be appropriate, but until all of the circumstances are reported it can\'t be determined. An excerpt. \'Several Republican senators are questioning expenses at the Boys & Girls Clubs of America, a national nonprofit organization that receives millions of dollars in federal funding. \'Sens. Charles E. Grassley (Iowa), Tom Coburn (Okla.), Jon Kyl (Ariz.) and John Cornyn (Tex.) asked in a letter to the group, released Friday, whether money is being spent on executive pay, travel and lobbying rather than on programs for needy children. \'The umbrella organization, which receives nearly 40 percent of its revenue from the federal government, stands to gain hundreds of millions of dollars more from a bill pending in the Senate. The organization posted a loss of more than $13 million, according to its 2008 tax return, the most recent one available.\'We find it hard to reconcile this loss given the amount spent on executive salaries, perks and lobbying expenses,\'the letter said.\'We are especially concerned because it is our understanding that some independent clubs have closed or are on the cusp of closing because of a lack of funding.\'Roxanne Spillett, president and chief executive of the tax-exempt organization, based in Atlanta, earned nearly $1 million in compensation in 2008. That includes a base salary of nearly $361,000, a $150,000 incentive and nearly $478,000 in benefits, expenses and contributions to a deferred retirement plan, a spokesman for the organization said in a written statement Friday. \'Leaders of large nonprofits should earn competitive salaries, said Ken Berger, president and chief executive of Charity Navigator, a watchdog group. \'The average compensation for executives at groups with more than $100 million dollars in annual revenue is $460,000, including deferred compensation, according to Charity Navigator.\' A marvelous book I\'ve been reading, Giving Well, Doing Good: Readings for Thoughtful Philanthropists , has many excellent thoughts to ponder, and one comes in the discussion of the different levels within the reasons for giving; and the third level relates to the best reason. An excerpt. \'The third level—which might be described as the most mature form of giving—is a way of participating in the life of others, or an expression of gratitude. Here the key element is the other, the recipient; not the self, the giver. The giver wishes to be, and becomes a genuine participant who shares in an achievement by facilitating it. This giving also has the reward of a beneficent return, although the benefits are primarily for others than oneself.\' (p. 129) This is a wonderful story, from the Stanford Social Innovation Review , about one person\'s vision-- it all so often starts with just one person --and her nonprofit\'s work to help immigrants to America become productive. An excerpt. \'In 2000, while working for a national refugee resettlement organization in New York City, Jane Leu decided that the federally funded system of matching immigrants to careers was a failure. \'We didn\'t have an incentive to focus on [the] quality\' of the placements, she remembers of her six years of putting highly educated, English-speaking foreigners in low-skill jobs. \'It was just about quantity.\' \'So with no funding, a borrowed laptop computer, and her kitchen table as a makeshift office, Leu started the nonprofit Upwardly Global, whose goal is to help highly skilled immigrants reclaim their careers in the United States. \'The beginning was rocky. With no funds and no employees, Leu was limited to one-on-one sessions with job seekers, reaching out to foundations for grants, and making employers aware of a hi,\'en talent pool: 1.3 million bilingual workers with degrees and professional experience in every possible white-collar profession. \'Successes trickled in. By 2002, the organization received its first grant and hired its first paid employee. In 2003, Leu\'s work was recognized by the Draper Richards Foundation when she became its first fellow, earning a $300,000 grant. \'Today, Upwardly Global employs 29 people to serve some 600 job seekers a year. With offices in San Francisco, New York, and Chicago, the organization also relies on its wide network of volunteers. Since 2006, it has helped place 400 people with 300 employers such as Google, Genentech, Wells Fargo, the Gap, Safeway, and the Fresh Air Fund. Although Upwardly Global remains a small nonprofit with an annual operating budget of less than $2 million, it is widely credited for highlighting decades of \'brain waste,\' says Jeanne Batalova, an analyst at the Migration Policy Institute. It is also the first organization that reintegrates professional immigrants into the American workforce.\' Most people are not aware of the large role that art—and the nonprofit cultural organizations that support them—play in the local economy, as they have in Midtown and North Sacramento. A recent study in Boston, reported by the Boston Globe , reveals just how productive that role can be. An excerpt. \'Each year, 30,000 people visit the Danforth Museum of Art. Hundreds of youths participate in its free school programs, thousands of all ages enroll in art classes, and still more view exhibitions. \'With this kind of score card, the Danforth finds it easy to convince the community of its value as a cultural asset. \'But an economic engine? \'A newly released study suggests that the Danforth and five other Framingham cultural institutions generate nearly double their budgets in local spending annually, creating scores of jobs along the way. \'For people who believe in the arts, they get it when we tell them art is good because we know it\'s goo,\'d said Danforth\'s executive director, Katherine French. \'But that\'s preaching to the converted. When we go to funders or business leaders or town officials, we need to be able to point to an argument that isn\'t a matter of opinion.\' \'So, the Danforth and five other Framingham cultural organizations — Amazing Things Arts Center, Framingham History Center, Framingham Public Library, Garden in the Woods, and Performing Arts Center of MetroWest — united for an economic impact study paid for by the Sudbury Foundation. It was no academic exercise. \'All six organizations are in the midst of, or are gearing up for, fund-raising campaigns to improve their facilities and ultimately make Framingham a tourist destination. They say proof of the jobs and business they create cinches their argument for financial support — especially during tough economic times.\' The nonprofit world has long played an essential part in the nation\'s politics. One of its earliest chroniclers, Count Alexis De Tocqueville, who came to America in the early 1800\'s and met with many of the founders, wrote one of the most perceptive books ever written about America. Here is but a small part of what he said about voluntary associations—nonprofits. \'Americans of all ages, all conditions, all minds constantly unite. Not only do they have commercial and industrial associations in which all take part, but they also have a thousand other kinds: religious, moral, grave, futile, very general and very particular, immense and very small; Americans use associations to give fetes, to found seminaries, to build inns, to raise churches, to distribute books, to send missionaries to the antipodes; in this manner they create hospitals, prisons, schools. Finally, if it is a question of bringing to light a truth or developing a sentiment with the support of a great example, they associate. Everywhere that, at the head of a new undertaking, you see the government in France and a great lord in England, count on it that you will perceive an association in the United States. \'I have since traveled through England, from which the Americans took some of their laws and many of their usages, and it appeared to me that there they were very far from making as constant and as skilled a use of association. \'It often happens that the English execute very great things in isolation, whereas there is scarcely an undertaking so small that Americans do not unite for it. It is evident that the former consider association as a powerful means of action; but the latter seem to see in it the sole means they have of acting. \'Thus the most democratic country on earth is found to be, above all, the one where men in our day have most perfected the art of pursuing the object of their common desires in common and have applied this new science to the most objects. Does this result from an accident or could it be that there in fact exists a necessary relation between associations and equality?\' (Alexis de Tocqueville, Democracy in America , 2000 translation by H. C. Mansfield and D. Winthrop. pp. 489-490) Today, the work nonprofits do in the political world continues, as this report from OMB Watch notes. An excerpt. \'Redistricting reform efforts have emerged as a key issue that could significantly impact our democracy in 2010 and beyond. While it does not appear that there will be nationwide redistricting reform, efforts are moving forward in several states. Nonprofits have taken a lead role in advocating for a process that is independent, nonpartisan, and fair while also ensuring that their constituencies\' interests are represented. \'Americans for Redistricting Reform (ARR) is a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization that bills itself as\'committed to raising public awareness of redistricting abuses and promoting solutions that benefit voters and strengthen our democracy.\'Its website allows visitors to learn about redistricting reform efforts in jurisdictions across the country. The site also contains fact sheets, court cases, research studies, and state and federal legislation on redistricting reform efforts. \'ARR was launched by the Campaign Legal Center and includes major nonprofit organizations as advisory committee members, including the Brennan Center for Justice, the Campaign Legal Center, the Committee for Economic Development, Common Cause, Fair Vote, the League of Women Voters, the Reform Institute, the Republican Main Street Partnership, and U.S. PIRG.\' It has many names, evaluation-outcomes-mission fulfillment, but whatever label is used, the point is that programs that ask for the public\'s money—whether directly from the public in donations or indirectly from the public through government grants—to do something worthwhile, should be held accountable to have actually accomplished what it is they claim to have done. VPP News has an excellent piece on this. An excerpt. \'In my last column, \'‘Social Outcomes\': Missing the Forest for the Trees?,\' I wrote about my deep, nagging fear that many efforts to assess outcomes are woefully off track. I pointed to several wonderful beams of shining light in the field, from Youth Villages to the Cleveland Clinic. But my dominant message was that many efforts in our sector are causing more harm than good. That column hit a nerve, triggering a volume and intensity of responses far greater than I had expected. \'After struggling though literally 20 drafts, I wasn\'t sure whether the piece was even coherent. Yet, it seemingly made some sense to a good number of thought leaders and practitioners I greatly respect—along with many others I don\'t know who apparently care deeply about this issue as well. \'Of course, not everyone agreed with my analysis. In fact, I got hard pushback on some points, and a few commentators wondered why it had taken me so long to own up to my own limitations in my approach over the years to the topic of outcomes. \'The majority, however, agreed with the thesis that we\'ve lost sight of the ends we\'re trying to advance. In the wise words of David Hunter, Managing Partner of Hunter Consulting and former Director of Assessment for the Edna McConnell Clark Foundation: \'It seems to me that the mess you describe indeed is enormous and very destructive—because few people involved in this work have thought deeply about managing towards outcomes and [they] have put the cart before the horse—focusing on HOW to measure rather than on WHY measure and WHAT to measure.\' \'Sins of Commission, Sins of Omission The feedback confirmed for me that nonprofit executives, staff, and boards; donors; and assessment experts are deeply frustrated with our sector\'s work around outcomes. • I heard a lot of anger at funders who don\'t walk (or fund) their talk. • I heard exasperation with nonprofits that are unwilling to embrace even basic methods of determining whether they\'re doing what they say they do. • I heard disappointment that outcomes assessment has become an exercise focused on cold numbers—the equivalent of Robert McNamara\'s simplistic and terribly misleading Vietnam body counts—rather than an effort to help nonprofit leaders achieve lasting impact for those they serve. \'We must be intentional about surfacing these roiling frustrations that are rarely getting voiced. If we don\'t, we\'re going to continue to perpetrate sins of commission and omission that prevent us from making even the slightest dent in the failing status quo that defines education, healthcare, and social services in America.\' One of the truly great examples of nonprofit work in education is the story of Catholic schools in America and as they enter a trying period in their illuminating history, having help charting the waters is appreciated. The Philanthropy Roundtable—itself a remarkable story of American philanthropy—has produced a marvelous resource, the 146 page publication Saving America\'s Urban Catholic Schools: A Guide for Donors , which they have made available as a free pdf download.
It was a great experience and I have to thank Andreas Mitisek and the Long Beach Opera for allowing me to photograph behind the scenes of one of their recent rehearsals. Now, that being said, the person I owe the biggest thanks to is my favorite flautist, Teri Christian (aka FlutePrayer, who writes the blog, FlutePrayer ). I met Teri and her husband, Bob, through blogging and I\'ve gotten to enjoy a couple of the performances (Opera and Municipal Band) they\'ve been involved with down in Long Beach (Yay, Long Beach). I\'ve been trying to work it out to to shoot one of the Long Beach Opera performances for quite a while. Teri has been the one working on getting me the okay to come in and snap away. I really hope I wasn\'t too much of a distraction. That was my biggest concern while shooting (well, that and also that I might suck at being a still photographer). No worries. Things seemed to work out fine. The orchestra and the all the performers had their game faces on and I did my best to ninja my way through the rehearsal. (Whoooo-WHA-KAI! Click, Click, Click! KI-YAAA!) God bless the Christians. (Heh-heh, doesn\'t that sound kind of redundant?) Our story was all about the coming boom in 3D entertainment technology.&nbsp; I was working with Dave Malkoff (who should really consider spelling his name M-a-l-k-o-v because that would be totally retro mad scientist sci-fi). &nbsp; We started in Burbank, shot an interview and b-roll for the piece, then drove over to the Burbank entertainment center to look for a good liveshot spot. We couldn\'t find a spot. Well, actually we found plenty of spots.&nbsp; Just none that would give us anything visually related to the story we were working.&nbsp; So, since we weren\'t going to be on TV until the later shows, we figured we should have plenty of time to dash over to LA Live. A good plan in theory. After battling crazy Friday evening traffic, we finally made it to a good spot for a liveshot.&nbsp; We set up just to the North side of the Regal Theaters. Right next to the psychic\'s office.&nbsp; Office?&nbsp; Hmm, what would you call it? Anyway, we managed to cut a piece that touted the coming wave of home 3D entertainment.&nbsp; No liveshot after all.&nbsp; We needed to be back to the station before the end of my shift and I needed to do that without hitting the station with a meal penalty. So, it wasn\'t the most action packed exciting night at work for me.&nbsp; Still, there\'s this one thing that I wanted to mention.&nbsp; I wanted to say just how cool it is to see parts of LA that most people don\'t even know about. Take Mr. Sippee for example. You might never have the opportunity (or logical reason) to try fried chicken sold at a gas station.&nbsp; Heck, right minds would tend to avoid something like that. Not me.&nbsp; But, then again, I did qualify that (yeah, right minds). Quick history: I first found Mr. Sippee during the 1984 Olympics (held in Los Angeles, if you remember).&nbsp; I was just out of school and working for ABC Sports.&nbsp; I don\'t remember why I stopped here, but ever since then, every few years, I manage to grab some chicken and their broasted potatoes. It\'s not exactly good, but it does take me back to a simpler time in my younger days. I can remember when I used eat junk like that and enjoy it.&nbsp; I\'m glad I\'ve grown up a little since then.&nbsp; I\'m older and smarter and. . . (sigh) Okay, let me have one leg and thigh combo with potatoes, to go. Blogged with the Flock Browser It\'s not an excuse for not posting (Come on, Blogging is never having to say, I\'m sorry!), but truthfully, it\'s been a difficult couple of weeks for me. You know, sometimes the postings are slow because I don\'t have much to say.&nbsp; Sometimes they\'re slow because nothing much interesting is happening. Sometimes they\'re slow because I\'m dealing with things that don\'t leave me a lot of space to compose my thoughts in any form fit to share. That being said, today I\'m trying to catch up on some the assignments I\'ve had the last couple of weeks. Last Monday night, I found myself in a SAT truck covering a candlelight&nbsp; vigil for Amber Dubois. There were thousands of people crowded into the courtyard of Escondido High School.&nbsp; The vigil had started about 6:30pm.&nbsp; I was about twenty minutes too late to catch the beginning by the time I arrived. It\'s a long drive from North Hollywood during the afternoon rush hour, but I had a pretty good idea of the route.&nbsp; I\'d passed through Escondido a week prior when I\'d been assigned to cover the search for Chelsea King. Lots of time travelling there and back to think about things. Anyway, it was another couple of hours before things slowed enough for me to pull my DSLR out to snap a few still shots. By then vigil was over and most of the people had gone.&nbsp; So, right then it wasn\'t exactly me alone with my thoughts, but it was far fewer than had been there just an hour or so earlier. There was a sadness that hung over the area. I believe we are the sum total of the things we experience.&nbsp; Doing what I do as a news photographer I get to witness more grief than most people. Sometimes it\'s easier than others to keep that sadness from becoming my own.&nbsp; It\'s a struggle.&nbsp; Sometimes I win. Sometimes I don\'t. Blogged with the Flock Browser I wish this wasn\'t a part of my day. I\'m running SNG for the Orange County bureau at the Amber Dubois memorial. Monsters do exist in our world. Stories like this happen and I know it\'s true. Posted via email from beFrank\'s posterous I\'m not working the Oscars this weekend, so maybe I\'ll take some time to actually go to the movies.&nbsp; Either I haven\'t been motivated to see much this year or there really hasn\'t been much I\'ve wanted to see. I kind of think it was that second thing.&nbsp; Also, I\'ve been pretty busy with work (don\'t get me started on the family stuff). Way back last Monday, I got sent down to San Diego to follow the night search activities in the Chelsea King disappearance.&nbsp; She was still missing at the time.&nbsp; An initial arrest had been made, but her body hadn\'t been found yet. It was pretty grim.&nbsp; Sure, all the news people talked and socialized a bit in the area where we were all parked.&nbsp; Still, it just seemed like a dark and depressive evening. We were pretty close to the same area where David Westerfield and the parents of Danielle Van Dam lived.&nbsp; Danielle Van Dam was a nine year old girl that Westerfield was convicted of abducting and murdering. Reporter Greg Mills and I had a simple story to put together for the ten and eleven o\'clock newscasts.&nbsp; There wasn\'t much to see from the media area that had been set up.&nbsp; There also weren\'t a lot of people around to question. Most of the people we had access to were friends and family of the missing girl and for the most part they weren\'t willing to be interviewed on camera. That makes our job a lot more difficult. One friend of the family told us off-camera that they were still holding out hope that Chelsea would be found alive. I learned the next day that Chelsea\'s body had been recovered from a shallow grave near the area of the search. That was my Monday. It\'s been a week of ups and downs. I\'m still standing, but very happy that today is Friday.&nbsp; I see an ice cold beer in my future. Blogged with the Flock Browser Just a quick update. I\'m in Hollywood hoping for a celebrity or two. Covering arrivals at a\'green\'carpet event. Posted via email from beFrank\'s posterous While passing through Temecula on the way to a story that will not likely end well, we saw this at a gas station. It made me smile. I\'m thankful for that. I\'m guessing there won\'t be many more of those tonight. -- Sent from my BlackBerry Posted via email from beFrank\'s posterous It\'s been a busy week.&nbsp; I&nbsp; could be posting a bit more, but most of the things I\'d be inclined to write about aren\'t really news or photography related. Just so you know where I\'ve been and what I\'ve been working on, I\'ll try to post a few pictures and do some small bit of writing to put things in context. These shots were taken out at Huntington Beach because the city decided to remove a bunch of the fire pits that line the beach. I was working with Suzie Suh that night and I\'ll be honest.&nbsp; I didn\'t think we were going to find anybody out using the fire pits.&nbsp; The weather forecast was calling for rain, plus it\'s winter.&nbsp; Who in their right mind heads down to the beach in the rain in the cold of winter? No people?&nbsp; That would have made the story a bit more difficult to cover. As you can see from the previous pictures, there were people out making fires. The rain didn\'t hit as hard as I thought it might, but I did get caught by a light sprinkle. The rain chased away most of the bon fire bugs.&nbsp; We were left with drunken young people who might not have been old enough to be out drinking. At least they stayed close to their fire and pretty much ignored us. I\'m kind of glad we were out doing this story now and that it wasn\'t a warm summer night.&nbsp; I\'m pretty sure we would have gotten more attention if that were the case. It was too cold and wet to screw with the media. Blogged with the Flock Browser
Light Bob blends effortlessly into his surroundings, Bossu Wood, Quatre Bras 1815.\'I fight for the one true King...King Jesus!\'There\'s a few things that really capture my imagination about the English Civil War. I love the look of the Buff coated troopers of both sides with their lobster pot helmets and breastplates. Also the massive, almost out of proportion pistols of the time really appeal to me. This grim faced veteran of Cromwell\'s \'iron sides\' knows why he fights this war and has trusted his faith to God to see It through. Wellington\'s Imfamous army. I think for the other Command bases I will just mix up a bit of Green stuff rather than the tricky Poly Filler. The results will be the same and a lot easier to achieve. For the Command base I tried something a little different. Knowing how Poly filler can crack and flake when dry, I gave It a wash of PVA glue to fix It. It was quite time consuming but for Command bases I don\'t mind pushing the boat out a little. Gloss varnish was mixed with Scorched brown and a little black to make the wet looking mud. I made small hoof and footprints in the Poly Filler with a brush and dry brushed with shades of brown. Here is the first of my three command bases. To make It a bit more enjoyable for myself I painted them one at a time rather than en Mass. This allows me to see the results a lot quicker and Is more satisfying. I tried a few things out and settled for the quickest and easiest way, with so many bases to flock It had to be something effective but fast to do. This involved flocking the base as normal but as the PVA was still wet, I pushed a brush loaded with brown paint into it to make footprints. Pu,\'les were created by exposing the flat base underneath, when this is painted dark brown and gloss varnished, It will give the effect of a mu,\'y pu,\'le. Very quick and very easy.

Hi internets. Just writing to introduce you to the newest\'moderator\'for the Camera Toss Group on flickr. Jens Ludwig aka QuakkauQ , hailing from Germany, has been a long time member and you\'ve seen his excellent images all over this blog. Now he\'s joined David Hull aka mtnrockdhh to help keep the photo pool on topic and help ease new members into the idea of Camera Tossing. The photo in this post was created by Jens and shared with the group yesterday. Very fitting for an introduction post I thought. Jens also maintains his own site/domain about camera tossing, www.cameratossing.de , where he posts some of his photos and experiments, news, yet ANOTHER Camera Tossing, HOWTO , and hosts an invited \'friend\'s gallery\' for other camera tossers he knows well. Jens is also the instigator of a collaborative project we are introducing to the community. I\'ll post more on that topic very soon. ;-) --- Camera Toss (The Blog) Feed Source http://cameratoss.blogspot.com Created and maintained by: Ryan Gallagher I guess one of the behaviors of the new genre of subscriber/reader driven content and publishing in the magazine industry is the inevitability of covering the same topic more than once. ;-) JPG Magazine , which did a story (including interviews) on Camera Tossing in it\'s formative youth ( Issue 6 ), has pushed another Camera Toss article amusingly titled Get Fresh With Us:\'Toss Your Camera\'in Issue 16 . Apparently JPG thinks seconds are fresher than firsts? This one however takes the form of a very brief photo challenge posed to it\'s readers/photographers online, and a selection of voted/edited picks of the result. Basically it\'s the magazine version of my\'Pool Picks\'postings except with JPG contributers being the\'pool\', and without really providing any instructive context, history, or origins for the readers and contributors. Ironically there was a user contributed howto article on the subject linked from the challenge pages, but all that content was left unpublished in the printed article. In it\'s original posted form, their challenge didn\'t even get the concept/definition of a Camera Toss correct. I mean really folks, it\'s not that complicated. A couple of senior members in our community took it upon themselves to get them to at least honor the original concept and change the challenge criteria. Viewing the incoming submissions it became clear that many of their contributors were also missing the point , so a handful of our 5,000+ community members took it upon themselves to submit high quality camera tosses in an effort to notch up the presentation of the concept. Even still, the final published selection included some that were obviously not a thrown camera . But, almost all who submitted from our community made the published version. Congrats to them and way to show solidarity, something this labor union member/advocate certainly appreciates! ;-) (Left: by David Hull , Right: by Christian Kinzler , Lower: by Marce Garal ) Please don\'t read this post as a criticism of the photos/photographers actually published. Most were indeed camera tosses and many quite interesting to look at. I just feel the methodology for coming up with the content in the first place left a little bit to be desired in the way of substance and professionalism. Many JPG articles were great back in the days before they restructured , and some of them continue to be quite good, but I came away from this feeling like they just needed some space filler? Which, in itself is fine, but if you wish to showcase a technique, you should either give some great instructions or display some top quality work (ideally both?). Why else would you publish it, unless, perhaps your only aim is to make your own contributors (a.k.a. paying subscribers) feel good about themselves? So three cheers to Derek and Heather for honoring our little niche of the photography universe with their original article, instructions, and interviews! (View online here ) This second time around? Not so much. As for the current editorial staff of JPG Magazine. If you wish to produce\'fresh\'content. Figure out a way to get your article/theme contributors to do their homework. A little tried and true journalism wouldn\'t hurt either. I\'m sure you would have had an amazing spread if you popped into our forums and solicited the community to contribute (exactly what was done for the Issue 6 article ). How\'s that for\'getting fresh with you\'? ;-) Maybe by fresh you didn\'t mean\'snarky\'. Oh well. ;-) Links Related to this Posting: Photo Challenge: Camera Toss (and all submissions) Photo Challenge: Camera Toss (published contact-sheet) JPG Magazine Issue 16 Unpublished JPG user contributed HOWTO JPG Magazine Issue 6 Article (instructions, interviews, commentary) Camera Toss Group on Flickr --- Camera Toss (The Blog) Feed Source http://cameratoss.blogspot.com Created and maintained by: Ryan Gallagher And now for a long... long...

Yet another signal of support from our fearless leader in Sacramento. Governor Schwarzenegger shares his support for Lights Out San Francisco. He calls it an\'illuminating\'event! We just learned that our very own, Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi issued a statement in support of Lights Out. Thanks very much for the support... -------------------------------- Pelosi Statement on Lights Out San Francisco Washington, D.C.   Speaker Nancy Pelosi issued the following statement regarding Lights Out San Francisco, a city-wide conservation event in which organizers are inviting the entire San Francisco community to install one compact fluorescent light bulb (CFL) and turn off all non-essential lighting from 8 p.m. to 9 p.m.:\'Climate change presents a challenge to the survival of our planet. While there is an urgent need for decisive action to a,\'ress climate change and greenhouse gas reduction nationally and globally, we must act locally as well.\'Solutions to the climate crisis must be as local as our neighborhoods and as global as the planet. By taking part in Lights Out San Francisco, each resident will be taking a positive step towards reducing green house gases emissions on a local level.\'Thank you to the visionary organizers of Lights Out San Francisco and to the many businesses, residents and visitors who will participate in turning out the lights in San Francisco and helping to reduce the energy consumption in our city.\'This just in. Our good friends at Craigslist posted a link from their homepages in San Francisco and LA. Thanks guys...this will definitely help raise awareness of our event and save energy. A big thanks to Raymond, Ryan and their friends at Holy Name School! They helped us pass out CFLs and information about LOSF at their elementary school. You guys have been a great help!
I missed you. Did you miss me? First things first: I\'m not dead. Although I have to admit I get a sick little thrill when I imagine the idea of my being referred to as such. Clearly there is something wrong with me; I generally rely on the\'Comments\'section to begin to figure out what that something is. I would love to tell you that I was on some ashram for a year and a half, fixing my life and learning the true meaning of Christmas, etc., but I wasn\'t. I did get my J.D., finally. Two law firms, a lot of snooze-bars, tardiness, absenteeism, subpar legal work and a generous severance package later, here I am--gainfully employed again. For now. Tomorrow, in fact, is the day that we\'re all expecting to get laid off on account of the financial crisis. Of course it will only be about 10% of the Firm\'s associates, but I can\'t imagine I won\'t be among them. How do I know? Lawyers at firms are notorious for their reticence about criticizing an attorney\'s work product. They\'re generally not a confrontational lot. But I\'ve gotten several talkings-to in my very brief tenure here:\'We\'re troubled by this.\'Is everything ok?\'You really need to pay more attention to detail.\'Please review, on a non-billable basis, what I ultimately sent to the client and compare it to the draft you sent me.\'These are all bona fide clues. But what really does it that the secretaries on my floor can\'t even look me in the eye. They are the ones with the worst poker faces (get it, ha ha). They see me showing up at 10am most mornings and leaving at 1:30 with my laptop bag, feigning some sort of work-related hurry. The ones with a maternal instinct probably worry a little bit; the other ones probably think I am a little such-and-such. Of course, I am a little such-and-such is the thing, but I still resent their knowing it. On the bright side, I\'ve got some dollars in the bank. But I really can think of only one thing to do with those dollars, and I can assure you it\'s not to set up responsible payment plans with my increasingly vocal roster of creditors. I will talk more about money in the next one I post, which will be sometime before 2011, I promise. A year after I started this very self-aware project, and what do you suppose has changed? I don\'t gamble or want to gamble nearly as much as I used to. Big deal. If you ever thought this blog was about gambling, you sort of missed the point, I think. Although I\'m grateful to all the poker players and what have you who found me in the past year. But it\'s not about those things. Even if I thought that it was about them when I started writing. So what then? It\'s about the void. It\'s about self-destructive compulsions. People pick at scabs even though they know they shouldn\'t. Or fail to wash their hands after urinating. We all know we should. Some of us don\'t. Why? Is it just laziness? I think it\'s not just laziness. To wit: I\'ve faked washing them for the benefit of others within earshot, which requires just as much effort as just lathering up, rinsing, and drying for real. I offer to you, the 15 people who still check in from time to time, the sum of my wisdom: some people don\'t wash their hands because they want desperately to test the notion that\'bad\'actions don\'t always have consequences, and neither do\'good\'actions, for that matter. In other words, a test of the basic tenets of what I\'ll call moral physics-- namely, that good people are rewarded and bad people are punished. Some of us would be condemned by such a literal correspondence between actions and outcomes. And so we quietly resist: by not brushing after meals and still expecting to not get a cavity; by not doing our homework and still hoping to pass our classes; by playing a game we\'re doomed to lose and still praying to win. There is a kind of bravery in it, don\'t you suppose? I just made an awful realization about myself. Awful enough to warrant my return to the internets. I\'d been clean for a while, you know. Just twenty minutes ago, I was lying on my couch with the sun in my eyes, too inept with the mechanics of vertical blinds to keep it out. I was mulling my options about what to do with the remainder of a Sunday afternoon. The television was tempting, but again, this time of day was bad -- too sunny, too inept. The glare would prove unbearable. I scrolled through my cell phone\'s a,\'ress book. Someone to call? I didn\'t really want to make plans with anyone, mind you. I wouldn\'t want anyone to see me like this -- unshaven and disheveled. I just wanted someone to text message with. Preferably a pretty girl. Something to distract me, if only momentarily. Distract me from what, you ask? The Realization. That is, the realization that I don\'t enjoy doing anything. I have no hobbies. Nothing that doesn\'t involve gambling (or at least uncertainty) interests me. Since I am not supposed to gamble anymore, I\'m a complete waste of space. Ever the resilient one, I\'ve found a cheaper and less satisfying alternative -- writing bizarre messages on craigslist.org and match.com, pleas for help, inflammatory poems, anything that might incite someone to write back. Sometimes on match.com, after reading the tenth amazingly vapid \'portrait\' in a row, I just start sending emails bitterly mocking them. That this sort of behavior fills the void that I used to fill by playing cards is noteworthy, I think. I am not putting anything at risk -- no money, obviously, but not even my ego. It\'s entirely anonymous. So I was never a risk junkie after all. I am a feedback junkie. I crave the moment when I realize that I have something to read from a stranger. Preferably a pretty girl. It\'s got nothing to do with making a connection with someone. It\'s got everything to do with snapping me out of the boredom of sheer radio silence. It\'s a reminder that I am not dead yet. It gives me a way to keep score, to measure success and self-worth. Especially when it\'s from a pretty girl. Don\'t most people crochet, or play golf, or go to museums to have fun? I wish those were fun for me. If I can\'t get my dose of uncertainty, rejection, acceptance, excitement, self-esteem from gambling, then I\'m going to get it from person-shopping on the internet. Sadly, the ones who write back are usually overweight amd live in the suburbs with their parents. And that just makes me more depressed. God, I pity them so much. Before we got rolling toward K.C., Natalie tapped the dashboard.\'We need to fill this bad-boy up! Serious fillage .\'Even at this relatively early juncture, I had become entirely accustomed to her idiosyncratic grammar and syntax. She spotted a gas station adjacent to the southbound entrance to the interstate. After some fumbling with the credit card, the pump and the nozzle, we were ready. It was nearly dusk. She did the driving, while I navigated.\'South for a while. Mostly southwest,\'I announced, once we\'d safely merged into the flow of traffic.\'So just down and over, right?\'Down and over? Right, down and over.\'Beginning a road trip of considerable distance with a relative stranger at this dangerous time of day gave me pause. The headlights hadn\'t completely taken full effect and it was hard for me to see. I figured it was hard for Natalie to see. Then she confirmed my suspicions.\'Whoa. It\'s hard to freakin\' see. Twilight and glare or whatever.\'Uh huh.\'In order to distract us from these annoynaces -- twilight? glare? whatever? -- Natalie directed her attention to the car radio, to find some tunes. Tuneage . All eyes turned to the radio. It was one that had come standard with the car, this powder blue monstrosity, this 1983 Oldsmobile Toronado in which we would soon die our fiery deaths. Its pre-sets were shiny metallic buttons, spring-loaded so when you press a button, the one that was originally depressed comes popping out of its socket with a vehemence you can feel and hear. Snap-click. Anyone with half a brain when encountering such a contraption would try to hold down two of the buttons at once, just to see what might happen.\'That\'s how things get broken.\'Uh huh.\'If I were to remove this gaudy button, there\'d be nothing but a small plate with tiny copper hooks on either end -- one end held the plate to the aforementioned gaudy exterior buttons; the other end attached, ostensibly, to the radio\'s internal wiring. The shiny metal on the pre-set buttons was, as far as I could tell, there primarily to provide the passenger with some sense of psychological remove between the button itself (merely a symbol, really) and the mechanism, raw and cold, that lay underneath it.\'And you may find yourself behind the wheel of a large automobile. And you may find yourself in another part of the world.\'We sang along. I am thrilled to be back in a position to write more blog entries. I was involved in a pretty big misunderstanding in Kansas City, Missouri. Before the Kansas City fiasco will make any sense, though, you will have to know who Natalie is. Last week, Natalie cut my hair at the local mi,\'le-brow hair salon chain, and we got to chatting the way stylists and clients will do, and I realized about five minutes into the conversation two things: (1) most of what was coming out of my mouth was utterly false; and (2) Natalie was interested. I told her that I was on a medical leave from my job in Houston, at NASA.\'What do you do for NASA?\'I\'m an astronaut.\'She pulled the scissors away.\'Psha! Shut up!\'I shut up.\'Seriously?\'Well, no, But it\'s not as ridiculous as it sounds. I do work for them, for NASA, on a contract basis. Mostly p.r. consulting, which is a year-round thing but gets especially hectic whenever there\'s a launch or a landing or anything. At more off-peak times, I call my friends at the newspapers, magazines, and the wire services and feed them \'feel-good\' stories about the space program. Seriously.\'That\'s awesome.\'What I tell people is that it\'s basically 40 hours a week trying to make the general public like rocket scientists.\'I don\'t know, rocket scientists seem pretty likable to me as it is.\'Well, obviously I\'m good at what I do, then.\'Whenever I get bored and restless, whenever the prospect of going to bed at 9:30 terrifies me, I decide that I should either gamble or go to a bar. Each offers such marvelous unknowns and opportunities. This is well-covered territory. So the other night I went to a local pub and had a few drinks. Alone. Watched the crowd. Fi,\'led with my cell phone. Pretended that someone was calling me, so as to allay my self-consciousness about being alone in a bar. I wanted to leave. I uttered some fake parting words to a friend who didn\'t exist to a cell phone that was off. I paid $6 for my beer. Then I got the bright idea to take a cab to the only strip club I know about in this whole city. I knew it was a terrible idea, and an awful waste of my rather limited resources, but o, the possibilities! Now, the interesting part: I hopped in a cab and told the driver the approximate intersection. I commented on the bouquet of roses that he had, bizarrely, attached to the dashboard. He didn\'t hear me. I repeate,\'dNorth and Kingsbury.\'V.I.P.\'s? You going to V.I.P.\'s?\'My reflex on this evening, as it was on many evenings previous, was to lie.\'Oh, no. I\'m not going there. That is a fun place though. Just here at the corner, that\'s fine.\'And so he dropped me off and began to execute his U-turn and get back to a main thoroughfare. I began to cross the street and make my toward the neon, the techno, the cheap-looking silhouettes. I took two steps and realized that if I continued toward the club in plain view of the cabbie, I\'d be confirming his (well founded) suspicion that I am a sleaze-bag who had just lied to him. So I changed course. I yawned. Nonchalance is key. I pretended to get another phone call again, and I walked briskly. Purposefully. Away from the club. Once the brakelights of the cab had gone safely over the hill about a quarter of a mile away, I figured the coast was clear. So I made a 180-degree turn and retraced my steps toward the club. I don\'t feel like telling you any gambling stories today. The sun is shining, the unreasonably loud construction outside of my apartment has ceased, and I feel good. I am eating healthier foods and taking better care of myself. I don\'t know why. Part of it is simple. I\'m so tired of gambling. I can finally see a way to where the pursuit of action won\'t be irresistible. I really can. Mostly because I\'m just flat exhausted. But that\'s where I have to stop. Because if I continue this thread, it\'s only trouble for me. Trouble because I start to realize that I have nothing with which to replace the monkey on my back, except maybe for a new monkey. (Alcohol? Drugs? Hookers? Greasy foods? I don\'t know, what else are people a,\'icted to?) I\'ll make it as plain as I can: I have thus far been successful in making the idea of gambling utterly undesirable to me. That alone seems like a worthy achievement. But concomitant with that success is my realization that nothing else in life is all that desirable to me, either. It\'s as if -- in my haste to eradicate the gambling disease from my heart, my soul, my nervous system, whatever -- I\'ve gone ahead and deadened everything -- including my ability to fathom that I live in a world from which I might derive enjoyment. So you tell me which is worse. Last Monday, I received something suspicious in the mail. It was a rumpled manila envelope to which electrical tape was nonsensically applied. There was no return a,\'ress, but instead a cryptic\'respondez si vous plait\'in the upper-left corner. I hadn\'t been expecting any packages from psychopaths, so I thought twice about opening it. Anthrax? A letter bomb, maybe? I couldn\'t be certain.\'Maybe someone out there thinks I\'m worth more dead than alive,\'I wondered aloud, eyeing the lumpy, brown parcel. It was a flattering notion, in a way. It was a very film noir -ish line to deliver, and I think I nailed it on the first take. Never mind for the moment that the proposition itself was utterly false. Even if it were theoretically true that my value as a dead person exceeds my value alive, I reasoned that either value was probably less than that of the postage. Simultaneously emboldened and deflated by this realization, I tore the package open and braced myself for the worst. Enclosed was a homemade t-shirt, emblazoned with a fairly crass pun using the name of the boarding school that I attended. Also, a bus ticket from here to a New England Town, where the school is located and where the senders of this parcel still reside. They wanted me to go out there for the coming weekend. An informal reunion of former roommates, friends, and whatnot. They thought they\'d have to entice me with gifts. They were right. Some are beginning their medical residencies. Others are working at financial services firms. They have nylon laptop bags with their firms\' logos on them. They wear golf shirts. Most are engaged or already married. I don\'t have to explain to you why this is awkward. Most of them know my situation. In fact, one of them came up with the idea of the reunion because he saw this blog, put two and two together, and wanted to check in. He was good enough to keep the discovery of the blog to himself, or so he assures me. It\'s not awkward merely because these people have more money than me, or because they\'ve done more with their lives than me thus far, although neither is ever comfortable. It\'s the little things. It\'s that their clothes just seem to sit right on their bodies more than mine do. They wear baseball caps that just look right on their heads. My head seems like it\'s a weird shape compared to theirs. None of them wears eyeglasses. I do. Their hair is straight and looks sort of conventional. Respectable. Never too unruly, even if it gets windy outside. Mine always looks a little off. Their teeth are white. They are in better shape than me. They are good at their jobs. Was my growth irrevocably stunted somehow? Why do these little things come so easily to them? How come, for instance, they\'re not even interested in eating the fortune cookies at the Chinese restaurant? I always feel like such a child when I\'m the only one who eats mine as we deliberate about the size of the tip. I don\'t own a pair of sunglasses, but if I did it wouldn\'t occur to me to hang them nonchalantly off the collar of my Polo shirt. But these guys make it work. I don\'t even have a driver\'s license. I guess I just never learned how.
NOTE: THIS PRINT HAS BEEN SOLD.I\'ve been ordering prints for a gallery showing this past week and I accidentally ordered one of the prints without matting (it\'s professionally framed and mounted to styrene, just not matted).  Whoops!  If you want the above framed 10\'x15\'print of the Aurora Borealis over a barn in Nebraska and are the first person to email me, you can have it for $60 with free shipping to anywhere in the United States.  The usual price for this is $140 for just the print alone ($190 for framed), so it\'s a huge discount.  Again, if you\'re interested, email digicana@gmail.com -- there\'s only one, so first come, first serve! BTW, the shadows of the trees on the barn are a bit of a funny story -- they weren\'t visible to the naked eye when taking the picture and only showed up later in the photo.  They are caused by the distant light of Lincoln, Nebraska reflecting off of a cloud over the city; the lit up cloud was bright enough to cast a shadow in the long exposure.NOTE: THIS PRINT HAS BEEN SOLD. Here\'s an old favorite from near Comstock, Nebraska.  This storm put down a quarter mile wide tornado about 20 or 30 minutes before this was shot -- here it is moving off into the distance.  Sometimes the\'golden hour\'light of a setting sun into a storm can create incredibly beautiful vistas that seem straight out of an apocalypse.
Civil Court\'s Jurisdiction - Companies Bill, 2009? - Corporate Law Articles - Chartered Accountants India,Taxpayers, CAs India, CA india ,ICAI, Company Secretary ,CS, Cost Accountants, MBA, Finance Professionals by Durga Rao We all aware that there is no express provision barring the Civil Courts to entertain certain company disputes under the Companies Act, 1956. We have been seeing the cases where the Civil Court entertains Company disputes if there is no specific remedial measure before the Company Law Board or the Company Court . The issue of Civil Court\'s Jurisdiction to entertain certain company matters is also supported by the Constitutional Courts on the ground that there is no specific bar under the existing Companies Act, 1956 barring the Civil Courts in entertaining Company matters and on the ground that the Companies Act, 1956 do no provide all remedial measures to all the shareholders before the Company Law Board or the Company Court. It is true that adjudicating a company dispute requires specialization and the Civil Court may not effectively adjudicate a Company dispute. We are all aware of the inevitable complications under Company Law. Laudably, an effort has been made to bar the Civil Court \'s jurisdiction to entertain company matters in the Companies Bill, 2009 or in the proposed new Companies Act replacing Companies Act, 1956. Section 391 of the Companies Bill, 2009 dealing with the Civil Court \'s Jurisdiction is extracted below: \'391. No Civil Court shall have jurisdiction to entertain any suit or proceeding in respect of any matter which the Tribunal or the Appellate Tribunal is empowered to determine by or under this Act or any other law for the time being in force and no injunction shall be granted by any court or other authority in respect of any action taken or to be taken in pursuance of any power conferred by or under this Act or any other law for the time being in force by the Tribunal or the Appellate Tribunal\'. The object of section 391 in the proposed Companies Act is to exclude the Civil Courts in entertaining company disputes and to avoid the jurisdictional ambiguity. Under the existing Companies Act, 1956, shareholders who are qualified to approach the Company Law Board under section 397/398 may choose to approach the Civil Court rather the Company Law Board. In CDS Financial Services (Mauritius) Limited Vs. BPL Communications Limited and others, (2004) 121 Comp Cases 375 , it was held that \'when there is no express provision excluding the jurisdiction of the Civil Courts, such exclusion can be implied only in cases where a right itself is created and the machinery of enforcement of such right is also provided by the statute. If the right is traceable to the general law of contracts or it is a common law right, it can be enforced through the Civil Court, even though the forum under the statute also will have jurisdiction to enforce that right. Sections 397, 398 and 408 of the Companies Act, 1956, do not confer exclusive jurisdiction on the company court to grant reliefs against oppression and mismanagement. The scope of these sections is to provide a convenient remedy for minority shareholders under certain conditions and the provisions therein are not intended to exclude all other remedies\'. Now, with the express bar under section 391 of the proposed act, if a remedy is available before the National Company Law Tribunal etc. then, no Civil Court can entertain a suit. But we need to a,\'ress an issue as to what is the situation if a particular relief is not available to the shareholders before the National Company Law Tribunal or under the new Companies Act? Under such circumstances, despite section 391 in the proposed Companies Act, it may be very difficult to bar the Civil Courts in entertaining Company Disputes or it may be difficult to lay down a proposition that no shareholder can approach the Civil Court against the managerial personnel, the management or the Company. It is true that the Civil Court may not be effective like the proposed National Company Law Tribunal, but, when a remedy is not provided before the Tribunal, the shareholders will obviously be approaching the Civil Courts and it may even be supported by the Constitutional Courts in future. It is true that the Civil Courts jurisdiction is effectively barred under certain enactments like Securitization Law and it is not usual to see a Civil Court to entertain a dispute under Securitization Act upon which the Debt Recovery Tribunal shall have jurisdiction. It is possible under the Securitization Law in view of the limited scope of the subject matter. Under Securitization Law, it is only about the determination of debt or the legality of the action taken by the Bank under the Act. Only the Bank, the borrowers, the guarantors and in some cases a third party, is interested in a securitization case, but, that is not the case with a Company litigation. The Company Law Board, Company Court or the National Company Law Tribunal as the case may be should consider many issues before passing an order in a Company dispute. In my opinion, it is very difficult to bar the Civil Court \'s jurisdiction as intended with section 391 of the proposed Company\'s bill or the new act. In order to achieve the objective of barring the Civil Court\'s Jurisdiction effectively, we need a detailed provision barring the Civil Court\'s Jurisdiction and there should be a provision similar to section 151 of C.P.C in the proposed Companies Act giving liberty to the shareholders or the members to approach the Tribunal for the relief which is not specifically provided under the Act. If there is such an arrangement under the proposed Act, the National Company Law Tribunal shall decide the maintainability of the applications or the petitions and can pass appropriate orders. I am sure that it is very difficult to bar the Civil Court \'s Jurisdiction as intended with section 391 of the proposed bill or the proposed new Companies Act. There tend to be lot of litigation on the issue of Civil Court\'s Jurisdiction even after the new Companies Act coming into force replacing Companies Act, 1956. Note: I have expressed my opinion on the issue and I am aware of the complications in Company Law. by &nbsp; Durga Rao &nbsp;on CACLub India PIL says cannot have mosque in Hindu area, HC says intolerance has to go A resident of a Hindu-dominated locality in Navi Mumbai has challenged the construction of a mosque; the Bombay High Court has told her such intolerance has to go. The petition, filed by Sumitra Kadu of Sector 50E, Nerul, alleges that CIDCO given a Muslim trust a 1042.27-sq-metre, reserved plot. Her advocate, G N Salunke, told the court Wednesday that not one Muslim family lives in a radius of 1 km from the site and only 331 Muslim families live beyond that radius. \'If the mosque is allowed there is every possibility of encroachment on the public open premises in the locality by Muslim encroachers which may badly affect the development of the city,\' says the petition, heard by a division bench of Justice F I Rebello and Justice J H Bhatia. \'So minorities cannot have their own place of worship? This intolerance has to go. Either we should live together or pack our bags and go,\' the bench said. Kadu contends she is a project-affected person and 12.5 per cent of the area was reserved for their rehabilitation which has not been completed yet. Her lawyer said the police commissioner has repeatedly stated there is likely to be a law-and-order problem if construction of the mosque is allowed, yet CIDCO has handed over the plot to the trustees of the mosque. \'Public in the locality is very much annoyed and aggressive and there is every possibility to riot and in law-and-order point of view the allotment is required to be cancelle,\'d the PIL states. It says the trustees are neither project-affected persons nor residents of Sector 50E. The construction of the mosque, it says, will affect the construction of a college the land was reserved for. The plot is also a mangroves bed but permission has not been sought to hack it, the PIL a,\'s. The court directed CIDCO to file an affidavit and submit a map of the area in two weeks.

Ltd. Vs. Harmeet Singh Paintal and Anr., pronounced on 15.02.2010 has laid down guidelines to determine vicarious liability of directors of Company. The SC has significantly narrowed down the liability of directors. It was held that only those to be held responsible who were in charge of the conduct of business at that relevant time. The Apex Court held that from the provisions of Section 141 NI Act, it is clear that that the persons who are sought to be made vicariously liable for a criminal offence under Section 141 should be, at the time the offence was committed, was in-charge of, and was responsible to the company for the conduct of the business of the company. Every person connected with the company shall not fall within the ambit of the provision. Only those persons who were in-charge of and responsible for the conduct of the business of the company at the time of commission of an offence will be liable for criminal action. It follows from the fact that if a Director of a Company who was not in- charge of and was not responsible for the conduct of the business of the company at the relevant time, will not be liable for a criminal offence under the provisions. The liability arises from being in-charge of and responsible for the conduct of the business of the company at the relevant time when the offence was committed and not on the basis of merely holding a designation or office in a company. The Apex Court further observed that Section 141 is a penal provision creating vicarious liability, and which, as per settled law, must be strictly construed. It is therefore, not sufficient to make a bald cursory statement in a complaint that the Accused Director is in charge of and responsible to the company for the conduct of the business of the company without anything more as to the role of the Director. But the complaint should spell out as to how and in what manner the accused director was in-charge of or was responsible to the accused company for the conduct of its business. This is in consonance with strict interpretation of penal statutes, especially, where such statutes create vicarious liability. A company may have a number of Directors and to make any or all the Directors as accused in a complaint merely on the basis of a statement that they are in-charge of and responsible for the conduct of the business of the company without anything more is not a sufficient or adequate fulfillment of the requirements under Section 141. The Apex reiterated its own catena of decisions, in which it has held that for making Directors liable for the offences committed by the company under Section 141 of the Act, there must be specific averments against the Directors, showing as to how and in what manner the Directors were responsible for the conduct of the business of the company. The Supreme Court after reiterating its own judicial pronouncements in various decisions laid down the following principles: (i) The primary responsibility is on the complainant to make specific averments as are required under the law in the complaint so as to make the accused vicariously liable. For fastening the criminal liability, there is no presumption that every Director knows about the transaction. (ii) Section 141 does not make all the Directors liable for the offence. The criminal liability can be fastened only on those who, at the time of the commission of the offence, were in charge of and were responsible for the conduct of the business of the company. (iii) Vicarious liability can be inferred against a company registered or incorporated under the Companies Act, 1956 only if the requisite statements, which are required to be averred in the complaint/petition, are made so as to make accused therein vicariously liable for offence committed by company along with averments in the petition containing that accused were in-charge of and responsible for the business of the company and by virtue of their position they are liable to be proceeded with. (iv) Vicarious liability on the part of a person must be pleaded and proved and not inferred. (v) If accused is Managing Director or Joint Managing Director then it is not necessary to make specific averment in the complaint and by virtue of their position they are liable to be proceeded with. (vi) If accused is a Director or an Officer of a company who signed the cheques on behalf of the company then also it is not necessary to make specific averment in complaint. (vii) The person sought to be made liable should be in- charge of and responsible for the conduct of the business of the company at the relevant time. This has to be averred as a fact as there is no deemed liability of a Director in such cases. Source : Recent judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of National Small Industries Corp. Ltd. Vs. Harmeet Singh Paintal and Anr . Right To Bail In India When you are arrested, you are taken into custody. This means that you are not free to leave the scene. Without being arrested, you can be detained, however, or held for questioning for a short time if a police officer or other person believes you may be involved in a crime. For example, an officer may detain you if you are carrying a large box near a burglary site. You can also be detained by storekeepers if they suspect you have stolen something. Whether you are arrested or detained, you do not have to answer any questions except to give your name and a,\'ress and show some identification if requested. The object of arrest and detention of the accessed person is primarily to secure his appearance at the trial and to ensure that in case he is found guilty he is available to receive the sentence. If his presence at the trial could be reasonable ensured otherwise than by his arrest and detention, it would be unjust and unfair to deprive the accused of his liberty during the pendency of the criminal proceedings against him. The provisions regarding the issue of summons or those relating to the arrest of the accessed person under a warrant or without a warrant or those relating to the release of the accessed at his trial but without unreasonable and unjustifiably interfering with his liberty. Thus this article is related with the provisions related with the release of a person on a bail. In words of Krishna Iyer J. .. the subject of bail:-\'..... belongs to the blurred area of criminal justice system and largely hinges on the hunch of the bench, otherwise called judicial discretion. The Code is cryptic on this topic and the Court prefers to be tacit, be the order custodial or not. And yet, the issue is one of liberty, justice, public safety and burden of public treasury all of which insist that a developed jurisprudence of bail is integral to a socially sensitised judicial process.\'Thus release on bail is crucial to the accused as the consequences of pre-trial detention are given. If release on bail is denied to the accessed it would mean that though he is presumed to be innocent till the guilt is proved beyond the reasonable doubt he would be subjected to the psychological and physical deprivation of jail life. The jail accessed loses his job and is prevented from contributing effectively to the preparation of his defense. Therefore where there are no risks involved in the release of the arrested person it would be cruel and unjust, to deny him bail. The law bails\'has to dovetail two conflicting demands namely, on one hand, the requirements of the society for being shielded from the hazards of being exposed to the misadventures of a person alleged to have committed a crime; and on the other, the fundamental canon of criminal jurisprudence. The presumption of innocence of an accused till he is found guilty\'. In order to sub serve the above said objective, the Legislature in its wisdom has given precise directions for granting or granting bail. Why Bail? Before actually determining the place of bail within human rights framework as conferred by the Constitution, it is important to examine the object and meaning of bail, such that an analysis of these fundamental objects and change therein may reveal a change. The object detention of an accused person is primarily to secure her/his appearance at the time of trial and is available to receive sentence, in case found guilty. If his/her presence at the trial could be reasonably ensured other than by his arrest or detention, it would be unjust and unfair to deprive the accused of his liberty during pendency of criminal proceedings. Thus it is important to note the relevant provisions enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights:- Article 9- No one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest, detention or exile. Article 10- Everyone is entitled in full equality to a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal, in the determination of his rights and obligations and of any criminal charge against him. Article 11(1)- Everyone charged with a penal offence has the right to be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law in a public trial at which he has had all the guarantees necessary for his defense. There are thus several reasons which have been enumerated as to why bail ought to be allowed to prevent pre-trial detention MEANING OF BAIL Bail, in law, means procurement of release from prison of a person awaiting trial or an appeal, by the deposit of security to ensure his submission at the required time to legal authority.\'Bail has been defined in the law lexicon as security for the appearance of the accused person on giving which he is released pending trial or investigation.\'According to Black\'s Law Dictionary, what is contemplated by bail is to\'procure the release of a person from legal custody, by undertaking that he/she shall appear at the time and place designated and submit him/herself to the jurisdiction and judgment of the court.\'. MEANING OF BAIL IN INDIA According to Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 (Cr.P.C. hereinafter), does not define bail, although the terms bailable offense and non-bailable offense have been defined in section 2(a) Cr.P.C. as follows:\'Bailable offense means an offense which is shown as bailable in the First Schedule or which is made bailable by any other law for the time being enforce, and non-bailable offense means any other offense\'. That schedule refers to all the offenses under the Indian Penal Code and puts them into bailable and on bailable categories. The analysis of the relevant provisions of the schedule would show that the basis of this categorization rests on diverse consideration. However, it can be generally stated that all serious offenses, i.e. offenses punishable with imprisonment for three years or more have seen considered as non bailable offenses. Further, Sections 436 to 450 set out the provisions for the grant of bail and bonds in criminal cases. The amount of security that is to be paid by the accused to secure his release has not been mentioned in the Cr.P.C. Thus, it is the discretion of the court to put a monetary cap on the bond. Indian Courts however ,have greater discretion to grant or deny bail in the case of persons under criminal arrest, e.g., it is usually refused when the accused is charged with homicide. It must be further noted that a person accused of a bailable offenses is arrested or detained without warrant he has a right to be released on bail. But if the offense is non-bailable that does not mean that the person accused of such offense shall not be released on bail: but here in such case bail is not a matter of right, but only a privilege to be granted at the discretion of the court. Provisions under the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 The Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, makes provisions for release of accused persons on bail. Section 436 of the Code provides for release on bail in cases of bailable offenses. Section 436 provides that when person not accused of a non-bailable offense is arrested or detained he can be detained as right to claim to be released on bail. The section covers all cases of person s accused of bailable of fences cases of persons though not accused of any offense but against whom security proceedings have been initiated under Chapter VIII of the Code and other cases of arrest and detention which are not in respect of any bailable offense. This section entitles a person other than the accused of a non-bailable offense to be released on bail, it may be recalled that S. 50(2) makes it obligatory for a police officer arresting such a person without a warrant to inform him his right to be released on bail. Section 436 (1) of the Code signifies that release on bail is a matter of right, or in other words, the officer-in-charge of a police station or any court does not have any discretion whatsoever to deny bail in such cases. The word\'appear in this sub- clause is wide enough to include voluntary appearance of the person accused of an offense even where no summons or warrant has been issued against him. There is nothing in S. 436 to exclude voluntary appearance or to suggest that the appearance of the accused must be in the obedience of a process issued by the court. The surrender and the physical presence of the accused with the submission to the jurisdiction and order of the court is judicial custody, and the accused may be granted bail and released from such custody. The right to be released on bail under S. 436(1) cannot be nullified indirectly by fixing too high amount of bond or bail-bond to be furnish by the person seeking bail. Section 440(1) provides the amount of every bond executed under this chapter shall be fixed with due regard to the circumstances of the case, and shall not be excessive. Further S. 440(2) empowers the High Court or the Court of Sessions may direct that the bail required by a police officer or Magistrate be reduced. Sub-section (2) of S. 436 makes a provision to effect that a person who absconds or has broken the condition of his bail bond when released on bail is a bailable case on a previous occasion, shall not as of right to be entitled to bail when brought before the court on any subsequent date even though the offense may be bailable. In Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India [1978] 2 SCR 621 The amount of the bond should be determined having regard to these relevant factors and should not be fixed mechanically according to a schedule keyed to the nature of the charge. Otherwise, it would be difficult for the accused to secure his release even by executing a personal bond, it would be very harsh and oppressive if he is required to satisfy the court-and what is said in regard to the court must apply equally in relation to the police while granting bail-that he is solvent enough to pay the amount of the bond if he fails to appear at the trial and in consequence the bond is forfeited. The inquiry into the solvency of the accused can become a source of great harassment to him and often resulting denial of bail and deprivation of liberty and should not, therefore, be insisted upon as a condition of acceptance of the personal bond. It also stated that there is a need to provide by an amendment of the penal law that if an accused willfully fails to appear incompliance with the promise contained in his personal bond, he shall be liable to penal action. J. Per Bhagwati &amp; Koshal, JJ. further observed that it is now high time that the State Government realized its responsibility to the people in the matter of administration of justice and set up more courts for the trial of cases. In Moti Ram &amp; Others. v. State of M.P [1978] 4 SCC 47 Urgent need for a clear and explicit provision in the Code of Criminal Procedure enabling the release, inappropriate cases, of an under trial prisoner on his bond without sureties and without any monetary obligation. Criminal courts today, are extremely unsatisfactory and needs drastic change. In the first place it is virtually impossible to translate risk of non- appearance by the accused into precise monetary terms and even its basic premise that risk of financial loss is necessary to prevent the accused from fleeing is of doubtful validity. There are several considerations which deter an accused from running away from justice and risk of financial loss is only one of them and that too not a major one. In this case the court also pointed out the enlightened Bail Projects in the United States such as Manhattan Bail Project and D. C. Bail Project shows that even without monetary bail it has been possible to secure the presence of the accused at the trial in quite a large number of cases. The Court laid down following guidelines, that determine whether the accused has his roots in the community which would deter him from fleeing, the Court should take into account the following factors concerning the accused: 1. The length of his residence in the community, 2 His employment status, history and his financial condition, 3. His family ties and relationships, 4 His reputation, character and monetary condition, 5.His prior criminal record including any record or prior release on recognizance or on bail, 6. The identity of responsible members of the community who would vouch for his reliability. The nature of the offense charged and the apparent probability of conviction and the likely sentence in so far as these factors are relevant to the risk of non appearance, and If the court is satisfied on a consideration of the relevant factors that the accused has his ties in the community and there is no substantial risk of non-appearance, the accused may, as far as possible, be released on his personal bond. Of course, if facts are brought to the notice of the court which go to show that having regard to the condition and background of the accused his previous record and the nature and circumstances of the offense, there may be a substantial risk of his non-appearance at the trial, as for example, where the accused is a notorious bad character or confirmed criminal or the offense is serious (these examples are only by way of illustration), the court may not release the accused on his personal bond and may insist on bail with sureties. But in the majority of cases, considerations like family ties and relationship, roots in the community, employment status etc. may prevail with the court in releasing the accused on his personal bond and particularly in cases where the offense is not grave and the accused is poor or belongs to a weaker section of the community, release on personal bond could, as far as possible, be preferred. But even while releasing the accused on personal bond it is necessary to caution the court that the amount of the bond which it. Section 436A . Maximum period for which an under trial prisoner can be detained - The new provision Section 436Awas introduced in order to solve the problems of undertrials\' who were languishing in jails as they will now be given an opportunity to be set free instead of endlessly waiting for their trial to take place. This move has been made due to a faulty criminal justice system and provides a makeshift method of providing justice and relief to undertrial prisoners. This seems to suggest that the Legislature and the Government have accepted the existence of the faulty system and their inability to do anything about it. For this purpose section 436 A was inserted. According to S. 436-A, a person who has undergone detention for a period extending upto half of the maximum period of imprisonment imposed for a particular offense, shall be released on her/his personal bond with or without sureties. The procedure provided is that the Court has to hear the Public Prosecutor and give its decision with reasons in writing. The Court may release the applicant, or if not satisfied may order for the continued detention of the applicant. However, no prisoner can be detained for a period longer than the maximum period of imprisonment provided. The exception to the section is that it is not applicable to offenders who have been sentenced to death. Moving onto the (de)merits of the provisions itself, S. 436-A gives discretion to the Court to set the prisoner free or to make him/her continue imprisonment. There is no mention of any applications having to be filed under the section. The first part of the section states that any prisoner who has served more than half the term of his/her imprisonment \'shall\' be released. However, the proviso puts a restriction on the mandatory provision by giving discretionary powers to the courts. This raises questions regarding the implementation of the provision. There is every chance that a prisoner may be sent back to jail to serve a period longer than the half term of his/her sentence. Till the Judges give their written reasons for the same, one will not know on what grounds a continuation of the term can be ordered as the section does not provide any guidelines. Will the undertrial prisoner continue to serve term till the maximum period of the Granting of Bail with conditions Section 437 of the Code provides for release on bail in cases of non-bailable offenses. In such cases, bail is not a matter of right. Court has sufficient discretion to deny or to grant bail. First Schedule to the Code provides the list of bailable and non-bailable offenses. Further cases often arise under S. 437, where though the court regards the case as fit for the grant of bail, it regards imposition of certain conditions as necessary in the circumstances. To meet this need sub-section (3) of S. 437 provides: When a person accused or suspected of the commission of an offense punishable with imprisonment which may extend to seven years or more or of an offense under Chapter VI, Chapter XVI or Chapter XVII of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860) or abatement of, or conspiracy or attempt to commit, any such offense, is released on bail under sub-section (1), the Court may impose any condition which the Court considers necessary: - (a)In order to ensure that such person shall attend in accordance with the conditions of the bond executed under this Chapter, or (b)In order to ensure that such person shall not commit an offence similar to the offence of which he is accused o

Well, it\'s commonly&nbsp; known as the Gherkin and I\'ve blogged about it before here . The building is in fact the home of Swiss Re , who are the Worlds second largest re-insurer. Founded in 1863, Swiss Re operates through offices in more than 25 countries. 30 St Mary Axe , also known as the Gherkin and the Swiss Re Building , is a skyscraper in London\'s, completed in December 2003 and opened on 28 April 2004. It is 180 metres (591 ft) tall, with 40 floors. Its construction symbolised the start of a new high-rise construction boom in London. The building was designed by Lord Foster, his then business partner Ken Shuttleworth and Arup engineers, and was constructed by Skanska of Sweden in 2001 2004. The gherkin name dates back to at least 1999, referring to that plan\'s highly unorthodox layout and appearance. Due to the current building\'s somewhat phallic appearance, other inventive names have also been used for the building, including the Erotic gherkin, the Towering Innuendo, and the Crystal Phallus (also a pun on Crystal Palace). &nbsp; Read more of the Wikipedia article here .

She\'s arguably the hottest star in the music world right now, thanks to her amazing dance beats and wilder than life stage persona, and now, Lady Gaga brings crustaceans to the limelight... Much cooler than the last crustacean-inspired headwear. Spotted at The Daily Mail . Over the last few months, there has been much weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth about strategy and tactics over how to communicate with non-scientists, and how to regain public trust over issues like climate change . A good example of this was a recent email exchange between Matt Nisbet and Randy Olson . Nisbet: When scientists... take action by responding with tit-for-tat attacks on climate skeptics, it... feeds a downward spiral of \'war\' and conflict rhetoric that appears as just more ideological rancor to the wider public. Olson: There comes a point where the public DOES want to see the science community stand up for themselves. People arguing that scientists are losing to denialists in areas like climate science because they have taken a poor approach to communication are perhaps mischaracterizing the problem. The problem of what approach scientists use to communicate with non-scientists is a real problem, but it is minuscule in these cases. Scientists have to, you know, do science in a,\'ition to communication with non-scientists. Denialists, as far as I can tell, can devote 100% of their time to communication. If scientists want to win, we need to find a way to support a dedicated crew of people whose job is to do nothing else but do public relations. Why don\'t national academies and organizations for the advancement of science have full-time, professional communicators? The only organization that I can think of that is even close to the sort of \'think tank\' person who seems to be so routinely called for media interviews is the National Center for Science Education . They do a heroic job, but there\'s only sixteen people listed on staff, including some whose job is in no way related to science. Allocation of resources is a major problem, and time is a 100% non-renewable resource. People who can devote time to that will, in the short term, win. The good news may be that because scientists are responsible for generating new knowledge, that can help in the long term. Ultimately, denialists cannot create anything new. Image from here .

A 60 cycle noise eliminator, the HumBug . To understand how marvelous this little box is, I have to explain a little about electrophysiology. Everything you\'re using to read this blog post runs off a powerline. So do lights and other electrical appliances. Those electric powerlines generate noise, or a \' hum ,\' that cycles 60 times a second in North American, and 50 times a second in Australia and, I think, the U.K. This \'60 cycle\' is picked up by recording electrodes, like those used to record neural activity. Since biologists are interested in the biology and not power mains, the 60 cycle just gets in the way of seeing the actual biological signal. So eletrophysiologists have to spend huge amounts of time trying to eliminate that 60 cycle noise by grounding, using Faraday cages, tinfoil, alligator clamps, and offerings to minor deities. Worse, it\'s incredibly unpredictable. A set-up that is perfect one day may have horrible 60 cycle the next day. Thus, anything that helps combat 60 cycle is a beautiful thing. And that is what this clever little device does. I had no idea it existed until I went to the annual Neuroscience meeting the year I was hired, and discovering it alone made the trip worthwhile. I had never met Carin Bondar until I followed her on Twitter . Only after that did I learn that we have several colleagues in common, so there is absolutely no \'old boy\'s club\' networking behind her decision to put me in Nerd Corner this week. Nerd Corner? It\'s like a regular corner, only, you know, nerdier. Actually, Carin thought I might be interesting enough to interview. I sure fooled her. Carin has a great website , with lots of other interviews, career resources, and more. Tell her Zen sent ya! P.S.   She\'s not related to Canadian astronaut Roberta Bondar . Continuing this week with some of my favourite things in the lab... Like my first selection, this is something that is basic but absolutely fundamental. A good stereo dissecting microscope, with a mount for a camera. Edward Tufte often argues that much of science is the story of increasing resolving power. The classic example was the telescope, which was celebrated in the last year\'s 400 th anniversary celebration of Galileo using the device for such great effect. Microscopes came slightly later, but also revolutionized thinking about the world. When I bought this microscope, I bought a camera lucida for drawing pictures, something I\'d use through much of doctoral and post-doctoral work. A good drawing could provide more information more efficiently than using 35 mm film then. I have rarely used it, since digital photography had made it faster and more efficient to take a lot of photographs and work with those. Last month, I complained about the common misconception that tenure was \'a job for life.\' Florida State University has just provided an example of why it\'s a misconception. Twenty-five examples, in fact. My sympathy to those losing their positions. The prospect of losing a job is always terrifying.
Whilst in search of the elusive snowdrops for tomorrow\'s challenge, I came across these crocuses in a churchyard.  Although not looking their best now, they still look very colourful, and the bee is certainly enjoying his visit.I have photographed some snowdrops now, so hopefully I can create a picture that will win me back the golden shield once again.

On 5 September history was made by 7 Ministers of Health from low-income countries together with serious politicians from West Europe and representatives from aid organisations that had learnt their lessons . The group launched the International Health Partnership. http://www.dfid.gov.uk/news/files/ihp/default.asp If aid from rich countries should effectively improve health of the poor, they said, the aid must be: 1. coordinated, 2. foucsed on improving health systems as a whole instead of one disease at a time, 3. and part of good national plans. These statements are evidance based, much needed but\'un-sexy\'. So let me translate the 3 statements into blunt words: 1. It is mad that Ministries of Health in low-income countries each week must meet a growing number of aid delegations. 2. It is cruel to tell millions of poor mothers;\'your child is dying from pneumonia for which our clinic have no drugs because Bush, Blair and rich activits did not know that pneumonia and diarrhea kill as many as do malaria, TB and HIV. 3. It is stupid to fund seprate clinics for each disease when there is not even staff and money e nough for one clinic in each village. So, 5 September 2007, is a happy day for global health. Fragmented health aid based on what is\'sexy\'in the media of the rish will be replaced by health aid focusing on what is needed in the clinic of the poor. Why is Sweden not yet part of the International Health Partnership? The Swedish Minister for Development Aid recently wisely focused Swedish bilateral aid too fewer countries. So hopefully she will soon join the Partnership of the wise. In these issues it seems more important if politicians are wise than if they come from left or right, so we can hope that Sweden will join. This vlog uses a flash presentation that Gapminder did with Trendalyzer graphics. It shows the development of Sweden during the last 300 years. It is my first attempt to use chroma key video with animated statistics as done daily with weather forcasts in TV. Following my talk in Swedish radio news on how to avaoid child deaths in pneumonia I get requests on where to donate. What is needed is steady funding over many year so that poor families get access to diagnosis and antibiotics. I judge that UNICEF is most competent to provide long-term support for child survival. The reason is good track record, that the present Director Ann Veneman understands how health service system in low income countries need long term support and that UNICEF base their policy on best available research. To save children now donate to http://www.unicef.se/stod_oss/ge_en_gava_har/ if not in Sweden look up UNICEF in your country. To support research for better care for infections of the poor donate to World Infections Fund http://www.vif.se/mallar/donatewwallit.aspx?SidID=10186 . Keep donating regularly to a good cause, and learn about progress and challanges. The underfunded needs are the continious majora challanges for poor families; pneumonia, malaria and diarrhea, education and the daily bread, i.e. agriculture in rula areas and job in urban areas. Water and sanitation also get less attention than emergency relief and HIV; the two worthy causes that presently receives almost sufficient funding. Cotton farmers in Texas earn their wealth from Soviet-like government subsidies. The annual 4 billion US dollar tax subsides to 25 000 US cotton farmers are of concern for global health! The reason being that this obstacle to free trade kill so many children. 1. Subsidies hamper economic growth in cotton producing west African countries. This keeps millions of hardworking farmers in poverty and hinder them to care well for their children. http://www.oxfam.org.uk/what_we_do/issues/trade/bp30_cotton.htm 2. If only parts of the 4 tax billions were re-directed tovAnn Venneman at UNICEF, she can avoid 600,000 child deaths from pneumonia by using 0.6 billion USD to provide care and antibiotics. http://www.unicef.org/childsurvival/index_35937.html 3. The soviet cotton economy of Texas is a major obstacle for successful agreements on free world trade. And a fair global trade system will save thelives of so many children\'s . http://www.wto.org/english/news_e/sppl_e/sppl57_e.htm The world is waiting for a US president with the guts to implement a cotton Perestroika in Texas! On January 27 at the World Economic Forum in Davos I asked Bill Gates for help. Help to speed up provision of courses on Global Health at universities around the world. I gave him a copy of our Textbook on Global Health (see below). He rightly noted that it was the first of its kind and that fact based overviews of the global health situations are badly needed. On February 7 I got this note from our publisher Studentlitteratur:\'Här kommer lite glada nyheter om Global Health. Dessutom har Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation köpt 200 ex som deras personal ska läsa!\'Gates Foundation had bought 200 copies, one each for the staff! Is it possible to write a book on the health of all 6.5 billion persons living on the globe? Well we did it and now it is on sale from Monday 27/11 2006. We are six authors, but it was Ann Lindstrand who got it together and Birgitta Rubensson that brought it to print. Hundreds of students read and commented various versions. http://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=nb_ss_b/203-2244500-9311121?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&amp;field-keywords=rosling We wrote it for those that in a short text want to learn: -how the health of the world\'s population has changed over time; -how the main determinants of health varied with time and place; -how health can be measured; about the causes of the main diseases in the world; -what health care that exist around the world. Our book is a summary of the works by greater scholars on global health. The pros with our book are the overviews; the cons are the simplifications and errors that are a consequence of our broad ambitions. Yesterday UNAIDS declared:\'the global AIDS epidemic continuous to grow... an estimated 40 millions are living with HIV... the number with HIV has increased from 37 millions in 2004. www.unaids.org But on the AIDS day in 2004 the message from UNAIDS was that\'over 41 million people are living with HIV/AIDS\'http://www.un.org/events/aids/2004/ Are UNAIDS lying? No, it is led by honest and good scientists, so how come? If you dig further into the data you find that the uncertainty range of UNAIDS estimates are wide: - somewhere between 32 to 44 millions lived with HIV in 2004 and today somewhere between 34 to 47 millions. So the true number may be slowly falling. A reasonable conclusion is that the number of HIV infected in the world remains the same over the last years. But telling that may put funding for much needed HIV/AIDS control at risk, so its better to conclude that the epidemic continuous to grow. UNAIDS may be excused for drawing the scary conclusion that the epidemic is still increasing, because they simultaneously communicate that there are solid evidence that the epidemic is decreasing in more and more countries. The exclusive focus on treatment may have delayed the decrease. Best available assessment indicate that money is best used on scaling up prevention http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/311/5766/1474 But international support to prevention tends to focus on the moral of the donor rather than the effectiveness of the action. The present US administration likes to fund\'less sex\'and Sweden likes to fund\'more condoms\'. Evidence from Zimbabwe tells that both works. Later sex debut and fewer partners may even be more important than more condom use http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/311/5761/664
I just read this very interesting point/counterpoint piece over on the website of the American Academy of Family Physicians. As you may or may not know, I am a proud Family Medicine Physician. And, yes, I am (still) a dues paying member of the AAFP. I owe a lot to the Academy including introduction to organizational medicine as well as leadership training as a medical student, family medicine resident, and now. The post I read was in their letter to the editor section and it was called\'AAFP Is \'Pawn\' In Health Care Reform; Academy Says \'Not So\' . The first letter is from former AAFP president Michael Fleming, MD. I first met Dr. Fleming when I was a medical student and I have always respected his opinion - especially on policy issues. Here\'s what he says: As someone who has been involved with advocacy for many years, I\'m writing to express my brutal disappointment in the AAFP\'s positioning and effectiveness in the recent health care debate. Although family physicians are in critical need of advocacy for their issues -- payment reform, a repeal and permanent fix for the sustainable growth rate, liability reform, recognition of the value of family medicine, graduate medical education reform, etc. -- the AAFP seems to have become more enamored of photo opportunities at the White House than the needs of members. In my opinion, the AAFP has been used by most of Washington as a pawn in a $2 trillion chess game -- and the pawn can never win. The AAFP could have taken the high road of quality care for patients and fair payment for the most valuable health care providers. Instead, the organization has gone\'all in\'for one highly partisan bill that will have absolutely no effect on the issues I listed above. The organization and its leaders need to take a close look at themselves and be reminded of the reason the AAFP actually exists: to meet the needs of its dues-paying members. The counterpoint to this letter is from current AAFP President Lori Heim, MD. This is also someone I have known for a long time and whose opinion I have always respected. The AAFP Board, to their credit, whether you agree with them or not, has been clear in their position. Here\'s what she said: I appreciate Dr. Fleming\'s point of view. But when it comes to health care reform, we have to remain true to the path the AAFP Congress of Delegates approved. We must hold on to the AAFP\'s long-standing principles of health care for all, a system founded on appropriately paid primary medical care, and a replenished pipeline of family physicians. Although not the end game, the health care legislation currently in Congress takes important steps in that direction. It expands coverage to more than 30 million Americans. With its 10 percent Medicare bonus for primary care physicians and pilot testing of the patient-centered primary care medical home, it embarks on reshaping our health delivery system based on primary medical care. And it invests in primary care training by expanding scholarships and student loan forgiveness programs for medical students entering primary care. Certainly, the legislation misses the mark in some areas. But the AAFP\'s work in shaping health care reform has put family medicine in good stead for future legislation that will a,\'ress, for example, the flawed sustainable growth rate formula and potential reform to the medical liability system. Far from being a pawn, the AAFP has been able to shape the legislation, which shows the first recognition of the value of primary care. Nothing is perfect. But we must make a start. The best start we\'ve had in 16 years is the legislation now before Congress. Now, before you predict some kind of wishy-washy\'on the fence\'opinion post from me, this may surprise you. It\'s no secret that I am disenchanted with organized medicine these days - whether it be AAFP or the AMA - or whatever. I wrote about it in October 2009 . I think a lot of physician organizations are having debates like this one. What do I think? Well, in my book, tort reform (ie - liability reform) and having a fix to the flawed sustainable growth rate are important to me and, I think, important to a lot of dues paying members of physician organizations - not to mention the potential negative impact the proposed legislation would have to physician small business owners (those who have not been swallowed up yet by corporate health care systems - or those physicians who already work for government agencies). Whatever finally happens, if anything happens with this legislation, I believe that these national physician membership organizations will have used a lot of political capital that will be very difficult to get back. In my opinion, it has already been kind of showing itself in a decreasing number of practicing physicians joining professional organizations, and even some leaving these professional membership organizations. In other instances, state chapters are distancing themselves from their national organizations. For example, the Ohio State Medical Association (which is the state chapter of the American Medical Association), has all but come out against the current AMA position on the known health care reform drafts. When it is all said and done, will it have been worth it for these national organizations? Well see....

Well, I\'m attending my first HIMMS conference (which stands for the Healthcare Information and Management Systems ) annual meeting. These are the 37 best posts that the medical blogosphere has to offer this week. In my editors picks, I wanted to highlight what I think are well-written stories. There is also a short excerpt from each of my picks this week. Also, I invite you to check out coverage of this week\'s HIMSS conference which include Better Health\'s live streaming interviews today and tomorrow (see the video feed and chat room at the bottom of this post). I will also be hosting a HIMSS wrap-up show with Dr. Val Jones on Wednesday, March 3rd at 8pm Eastern Time for The Doctor Anonymous Show 150 which is my live, interactive internet radio show. Now, on to Grand Rounds! Dr. A\'s Picks Of The Week Captain Atopic , a medical student in Australia, sees so much emotion in people\'s eyes . Sitting in the corner of the meeting room, an off-call consultant\'s eyelids fall. The night registrar talks animatedly and the day team joke. The consultant\'s patients have been discussed and his coffee hasn\'t kicked in. The bounce of his chin rouses him. The round passes through a medical ward; eyes look up, eyes dart around. The octogenerian\'s glassed, cloudy eyes search for focus, and find wanting. The narc\'d lady next door sleeps soundly, eyes rolling in an opiate fog. Bruce Campbell , a physician from the United States, learns that physicians and nurses have a lot to share even when we believe we do not. The patient arrived at the rural clinic near Guazapa, El Salvador, in his mother\'s arms with a mouth gag tied in place and his hands wrapped in bandages. As his mother put him gently onto the examination table, his muscles twitched hard, tearing the paper bed cover and forcing the gag out of his mouth. \'Be calm,\' his mother whispered to him in Spanish. He remained contorted but visibly quieted as our pediatrician, Dr. Mike, held him. Kerri Sparling , diabetes blogger extraordinaire, shares another side of future mommyhood. I love BSparl. I love her little feet and her pouty lips and that feeling I get when she rolls around inside of me. I love knowing that my daughter is just a few weeks away from becoming a part of our Sparling family, and I know that every moment of this pregnancy is completely worth every iota of effort and worry. That being said.... I\'m starting to lose my mind a bit. That being said ... I\'m starting to lose my mind a little bit. Bongi , a physician from South Africa, learned early in medical school that consultants only stick to their field . we walked into the tea room where the consultants were hard at work drinking tea and introduced ourselves. the designated tutorial giver groaned audibly. he then glanced over at his colleagues and rolled his eyes. they chuckled. funnily enough i think they thought they were being subtle. after all we were mere medical students and therefore couldn\'t easily pick up on the finer points of non-verbal communication like specialist psychiatrists could. i was immediately annoyed, but i chose to hide it.

I just got off of a midnight flight home from a hectic weekend. When I opened my suitcase to unpack it, there was the little note saying that TSA had opened my luggage to inspect it. There was also a bite-size 3 Musketeers bar. IMMD. via itmademyday.com If they did that every time, nobody would mind.

Giving a talk at the University of Utah on everything from scaling, clustering, mysql, mysql internals, noSQL (Cassandra) to how to manage all this stuff. If you are there at University I\'m bringing some Swag! Also I will upload the slides and put them here. Brian Aker , a brilliant helpful duder, who I learn a lot from. Gives a great talk about what is NoSQL explained in a way for database guys. I warn you, there are some points in this video where you can\'t hear Brian due to the audience\'participation\'but you should get the content. INNODB has some irritating gotchas that makes disk space management hard. In 2002ish INNODB, a,\'ed innodb_file_per_table to get around allot of these issues, but it does not fix everything. If you are running innodb_file_per_table, you will notice in your database directory db.opt - database characteristics file. tablename.frm - the table structure. tablename.ibd - the actual innodb table space file Imagine that you have a table with 10 million rows and you delete say 5 million rows in multiple chunks around 400K chunks, because deletes are slow. Next, you notice that the table space file did not shrink. So what do you do? OPTIMIZE tablename, tada all the wasted space is reclaimed, but here is the PROBLEM the ibdata file grew! ibdata stores all of the UNDO LOGS thus GROWS due to the deletes and space is never reclaimed. Ok, lets try coping the tablespace file to another directory and re-import the tablespace file after wiping the data dictionary (ibdata). For instance /etc/init.d/mysql stop cd /var/lib/mysql/DB cp - /tmp/hold rm /var/lib/mysql/ib- cp /tmp/hold/- /var/lib/mysql/DB /etc/init.d/mysql start // create the ibdata file ALTER TABLE tablename IMPORT TABLESPACE ERROR 1146 (42S02): Table \'DB.tablename\' does not exist Really, there is nothing that you can do to force innodb to purge the undo logs in the ibdata file without a full dump of the data to text and then reimport the data. So here are the steps to shrink all table spaces and the ibdata file mysqldump --all-databases (or use mk-parallel-dump) stop mysql rm -f /var/lib/mysql/ib- /var/lib/mysql/DB/- start mysql mysqlimport (or use mk-parallel-restore) Takes a bunch of time but there is no other recourse. If you know of another way please share :) I\'ll be giving a web presentation Jan. 19th 2010. If you would like to check it out please do! Scaling to 200K Transactions per Second with Open Source - MySQL, Java, curl, PHP I thought it went well. I will post the link to the slides here :) Scaling to 200K Transactions per Second with Open Source - MySQL, Java, curl, PHP In a procedural language without the use of threads (or Inter Process Communication via forks), to execute I/O requests they are done one after another. Synchronous Queries produce at best a Big-O of N such that N is an element of I/O communication (queries) and N equals the number of queries needed to achieve the requested dataset. With IPC or threads we can speed up common O(N) problems to reduce the N with parallelism, its still functionally a O(N) yet from a single instance point of view N is much less because threads (IPC) takes that Serial computing component and executes the code in parallel. To better explain what I am talking about lets look at some PHP code: foreach($friends as $friend){ $data[] = getMySQLData(\'SELECT - FROM AccountData WHERE userid = $friend); } The Primary key for the AccountData table is userid. Assuming that you have 5000 friends, the query has to be executed 5000 times. We can reduce the O(N) and change it to a O(nlogn) (Binary Tree - doesn\'t take into account other factors) by switching the query to $data = getMYSQLData(\'SELECT - FROM AccountData WHERE userid IN ( .)\'); We just sped up the retrieval of the data significantly, yet we just introduced a bottle neck on the datalayer. Our architecture requires that the data is located in a single location. What if AccountData\'s data is spread across many servers federated by userid? This means that userid belongs to a server, so the server contains a shard of the AccountData\'s Data. Now we are back to a O(N) where each query needs to be executed on the corresponding shard. The logical next step is to group queries per shard and run across them all. For instance $multiShardIDs = $genericShard->getMultipleShardIDs($objIds); foreach ($multiShardIDs as $shardID => $shardUserIDs) { if (stripos($orgQuery,\'WHERE\') !== false){ $query = $orgQuery.\'AND {$column} IN (\'.implode(\',\', $shardUserIDs).\')\'; } else{ $query = $orgQuery.\'WHERE {$column} IN (\'.implode(\',\', $shardUserIDs).\')\'; } $shard_to_sql[$shardID] = $query; .... more stuff .... Yet this is still a O(N) its just that N is smaller. Each query is still executed serially. Let\'s look at some stats of synchronous queries of SELECT 1; This query is executed across 35 shards and the timings are from PHP point of view. Field End Value Start Value Delta ru_oublock 0 0 0 ru_inblock 0 0 0 ru_msgsnd 0 0 0 ru_msgrcv 0 0 0 ru_maxrss 0 0 0 ru_ixrss 0 0 0 ru_idrss 0 0 0 ru_minflt 9872 9865 7 ru_majflt 0 0 0 ru_nsignals 0 0 0 ru_nvcsw 11344 11114 230 ru_nivcsw 977 968 9 ru_nswap 0 0 0 ru_utime.tv_usec 865054 849053 16001 ru_utime.tv_sec 16 16 0 ru_stime.tv_usec 556097 552097 4000 ru_stime.tv_sec 1 1 0 Total Execution Time 0.18323707580566 As you can see, to execute this from PHP it took 100 ms, 100s pages reclaimed and 200s voluntary context switches to query 35 servers. Now let\'s look at Asynchronous execution of SELECT 1; // the query generation is from PHP yet the execution is performed on a server that executes the query in parallel Field End Value Start Value Delta ru_oublock 0 0 0 ru_inblock 0 0 0 ru_msgsnd 0 0 0 ru_msgrcv 0 0 0 ru_maxrss 0 0 0 ru_ixrss 0 0 0 ru_idrss 0 0 0 ru_minflt 9131 9121 10 ru_majflt 0 0 0 ru_nsignals 0 0 0 ru_nvcsw 3891 3889 2 ru_nivcsw 290 290 0 ru_nswap 0 0 0 ru_utime.tv_usec 596287 596287 0 ru_utime.tv_sec 4 4 0 ru_stime.tv_usec 460028 460028 0 ru_stime.tv_sec 0 0 0 Total Execution Time 0.019363880157471 As you can see from the table above executing the query asynchronously produced results with less context switching, less pages reclaimed and almost 10 times execution improvement over the synchronous query counterpart. How is the asynchronous query executed? Lets take a look at the figure below. So A user comes through the firewall / load balancer with a HTTP Request to the www pool that runs PHP. PHP now makes a CURL request to the Async Shard Servers (through a LB same LB different PORT). The HTTP Request to the Async Shard Server contains the SQL we wish to execute. The Async Shard Servers has a thread per shard and executes the request in parallel. The results are merged and sent to the calling CURL process via JSON. The returned JSON is then converted into a PHP object. This is a typical three-tier environment. When having to query multiple servers using an Asynchronous Tier is dramatically faster; in fact its as fast as the slowest server. This is the main sticking point of why asynchronous queries are faster then synchronous queries (in this context) since the total execution time for serial queries is the SUM of all the query execution. The current version of the server is used for Friend Query execution across the datalayer. Its been solid for a few months now, and I\'m currently getting permission to release it as an Open Source Product. The features this server contains: Lightweight CPU bounded Scales Linearly A Timer Thread to keep the database config up to date in memory and fetching the config from PHP so if PHP changes connections to the shards so does Java Uses Java-6 Executor Service Merges the result set prior to sending it to the calling process Communicates via JSON Uses MySQL Connector/J Supports a high concurrency Optimized thread usage If I have run into a mySQL bug, I look to see if that bug is fixed by searching the mySQL bug database. If I\'ve notice a performance bottleneck, I look to see if the performance bottleneck has been fixed by searching the same database. I will NOT upgrade to the latest and greatest version of mySQL (5.4) I stay within my branch (5.0). These are my three general motivations that drive my upgrade decisions. Anytime I upgrade I also make a list of things that might affect my environment for the stuff I use. Here are my steps: Check the change log Ignore all the NDB changes... I don\'t use it and that\'s the majority of fixes. This is also, why I do not use it. List the changes that will affect the production environment Deploy the version that I picked on a few servers running my original config Do data corruption tests (make sure my checksum scripts return the same data) Verify that the problem I\'m trying to fix is fixed Deploy to more boxes Let the new server bake for a period of no less than a week Deploy everyplace So now, I\'m upgrading from 5.0.56 to 5.0.86. What I\'m trying to fix is mysql memory overhead at high levels of ram. For instance, I have a slew of 48GB boxes. I set the bufferpool to 40GB; the OS uses 1 GB of memory (roughly) leaving an overhead of 7GB for the system cache and various spikes of sort buffers. Over a period, I see that mySQL will consume and hold onto 47GB of memory for an unknown reason even with some tight my.cnf settings. (I\'m certain they are tight since I know what each buffer does). Therefore, testing some later versions of mySQL we found that these later versions do not grow past the settings defined yet performs the same. Next, since I decided that upgrading is a good solution, now it\'s time to list all the changes that fixes things. 5.0.58 - INNODB performance fix 5.0.60 - various problems that I should be affected by but havn\'t noticed so it\'s fair to assume that said problems were introduced after my build. 5.0.62 - nothing major noticed the sp releases that\'s why I wait. 5.0.64 - nothing major 5.0.66 - security fixes and fixes to fix the bugs introduced from this build. 5.0.67 - two INNODB performance fixes and crash bug fixes. 5.0.68 - changes show status and fixes an innodb crash bug. 5.0.70 - fix another INNODB crash bug and security fixes 5.0.72 - more general bug fixes 5.0.74 - more stuff I don\'t care about 5.0.75 - stuff given to Enterprise users now in community 5.8.76 - more bug fixes that I do not need 5.0.78 - more bug fixes I do not care about (run MS Access on windows not mySQL) 5.0.80 - problem with error messages for concurrency limits that caused an assert failure 5.0.82 - Fixes to fix fixes for this build. 5.0.83 more minor fixes that I don\'t seem to have a problem from 5.0.84 - more bug fixes for INNODB and latches 5.0.85 - looks like windows fixes 5.0.86 - fixes that I\'m not having problems with Therefore, overall, upgrading should give me a boost in performance. My own internal testing sees some tighter memory usage, even though this is not fixed explicitly, the product has matured overall so I can account for the reduction in memory to that. What is Nagios? Nagios IMHO is the best Open Source monitoring system out there. It supports hosts checks, a level to determine on a host level if a box is considered\'up\'. It supports service check, a level to determine if a particular service such as mySQL is up. It has features to log all events to a flat file or to a DB. It can notify you when a service is in a warning state, error state or unknown state. For the purpose of this article, I am going to talk about handling events such as a clearing up swap. First, let us look at some configuration of Nagios. We are going to define a command, then service acting on that command. Let us assume that the nagios install is in /usr/local/nagios. Therefore, in /usr/local/nagios/ a few configuration files are key: - /usr/local/nagios/etc/objects/commands.cfg - the command file where the checks are defined - /usr/local/nagios/etc/hosts/-/hosts.cfg - the services file where the checks are defined for execution based on other directives in this file. A command: # \'check_local_swap\' command definition define command{ command_name check_local_swap command_line $USER1$/check_swap -w $ARG1$ -c $ARG2$ } This says that check_local_swap executes check_swap with a warning threshold of $ARG1 and a critical threshold or $ARG2 Next when defining a service for a host define service{ use generic-service; Name of service template to use host_name dbfacebook34b ; hostname service_description SYS:Swap ; what shows up in alerts is_volatile 0 check_period 24x7 ; threshold when to check (all the time) max_check_attempts 4 ; threshold to check before marking state event_handler handle-swap ; handle an event (another command) normal_check_interval 5 ; in seconds retry_check_interval 1 ; only try once before reporting the state contact_groups itops ; contact group to send notifications to notification_options w,u,c,r ; need to look this up for all defs notification_interval 600 ; retry sending notifs every 8 mins notification_period 24x7 ; keep sending them check_command check_nrpe!check_local_swap!80%!55% ; execute the event handler and warn like hell } Lots of goodies as you can see. Let us look at the event handler define command{ command_name handle-swap command_line /home/scripts/handle_swap.pl } This means execute this script whenever any event for swap occurs (I decided to make this simple and not put a threshold on this). What does handle_swap.pl do - well it\'s a perl script that looks at free memory and if only a few 100K of swap is in use, swapoff -a; swapon -a; In this case, it is a bit safe to do this. Why do this? Why not just turn of swap. I have talked in depth about this subject-but for a minor recap. Linux needs swap else, kswapd will freak out. Swap in DB\'s is bad so I clean it up automatically since O_DIRECT on my SAN is not an option. Why not just run a cron job? Nagios keeps a log, I like to review what is happening from a central location, and nagios is freaking COOL. For the first time ever I took a two-week vacation. How can a person who has 100s of database servers, 100s of web servers, and a system that supports 100K tps across 20 TB of data is able to take a vacation? Easy, I have a great team that is very competent in managing the platform by following our cookbook routines and guidelines for new application interaction with the databases. Where did I go? I went to NYC-stayed in Tribeca and only ate Pizza, Hotdogs, White Castle and Hala Food from vendors that are nearly on every street corner. I also lost 6 pounds! After three months of half-ass dieting to prepare for my Pizza diet, who would have known that just going for it was the key to success! How did I do it? Well, first I walked to Little Italy, bought 2-4 slices, ate them, and then walked around the city. That is it. As a Database Dude, I do not do much walking except for when I am too tired to run on the treadmill for 20 mins. I was averaging around 10 miles a day for a 12-hour period walking around NYC taking pictures, enjoying the sites, eating, drinking, and then repeat. I even walked from Canal Street all the way to the Staten Island Ferry just because. Man it was great. After NYC, I went to Puerto Rico for the second time. My family and I had a freaking awesome time. We went to the only US National Park that is a Rain Forest. Went to Vieques to the Bio Luminous Bay, where the single cell organisms light up when kinetic energy is applied to them. Went to Culebra, to Flamenco Beach   which is off the hook: much better than any other beach I have been to. Drove around the entire Main Puerto Rican Island stopping off in Rincon and eating every 3-4 hours. I am fully rested and feel like a 20 year old again. So, expect a lot more posts. I think the order will be: Migrate 20 TB of data into a new Format without downtime. How to make Friend Queries work with a database. Throughput increase from Asynchronous Queries.
Okay, please stop laughing. There have been cases of upstarts beating well-established rivals. Before Microsoft Word came along, many of us were using WordPerfect and WordStar. Before Google came along, we used AltaVista and Yahoo. Before Internet Explorer came along, we used Netscape, and now we\'re watching IE lose ground to Firefox. Trust me, crazy things happen in the technology space. So, it wouldn\'t be unthinkable for the Zune to give the iPod touch a run for your money.

We all seem to divide our lives up into different sections.  Some go by relationships, some by children, some by jobs, debt, or even cars.  Today, I think the world is asking me to step into a new section of life and I\'m not sure I want to listen to that call.  I\'m 25, 1/4 dead, old man river, years beyond my maturity, or whatever else you want to call it.  However, I prefer to look at it a bit simplier.  I now have a right to make people listen to me.  I\'m a true adult, no more funny talk, I\'m all business now.
so now that i got you going about that hot teacher that you had the hots for, what if i kicked up the hotness factor of the story by mentioning to you, what if along with that first hot teacher was also a second hot teacher at the school! double the pleasure, double the fun! aren\'t you wishing you were back in high school now? how about we take these two teachers and put them together in an empty classroom? ooof, i can barely look straight now, forget about typing!
We get back to the ship and find that Dad is feeling somewhat better, and he joins us for dinner. Our next stop will be Cozumel, and Felix, our waiter, recommended stopping off at Carlos\'n Charlie\'s, the local party bar. He told us that generally, by 3:00 PM or so, the girls start losing their tops, and the party continues on. He told us that the free tequila flows most of the day. Well, that was enough for us! We scatter, and meet again at Dizzy\'s for a little more jazz, and a final nightcap. Little did we know that the shit was once again going to hit the fan in the morning...

The Mis-Education of the Negro\', by Carter G. Woodson. This is going to be a great book and will make for a great topic of discussion in our next meeting. In my opinion this is a must read for all African Americans. It will bring insight into a lot of issues that plight us as a people. And what you will find even more interesting is that this book was published in 1933 but still incredibly relevant to the problems we face today almost 80 years later.

We bought our Lexus RX 300 here many years ago and then traded it in for the Lexus RX 330 which I now drive.  Each and every time I have gone back to the dealership for service, they have been amazing.  They are fast.  They are efficient.  They drive me to my office at no cost and then reimburse the cost of a cab when I come back.  At the dealership they have a cafe with reading chairs, flat screens etc. And to top it all off, they give free car washes to their customers.
My wife and I were thrilled that a few friends recommended we try out Coast. Easily accessible from 90/94, there was no corkage fee for the bottle of wine we brought in and the sushi was excellent. Highly recommend the Sunshine and Volcano rolls in a,\'ition to the Hamachi/Jalapeno. Also a huge fan of their spicy miso soup and spinach appetizers. We\'re going to make this at least a biweekly outing.
Sebastian has Down Syndrome and requires more attention than most babies. Among other things, he has to be fed every 1 1/2 to 2 hours, even through the night. Mindy knew his parents could use a break. So she volunteered to hold him for a while. She sang him to sleep. Mindy would be the first to tell you it\'s a God thing. Yep! I think it\'s just beautiful! And so does little Sebastian!
Am I the only one who finds Atwood\'s writing the equivalent of a Sunday roast? Eagerly awaited and elegantly presented, you know that no matter which bit of the chicken you choose, you will always be satisfied. And any puns involving her novel \'The Edible Woman\' are verboten. The roast potatoes will be crunchy, the greens will be soft and the Yorkshire pu,\'ings will be well cooked. Margaret is to me the epitome of a family gathering. I crave her writing style in the same way I crave my wife\'s roast dinners.
Experience tells me we need to take this, hopefully temporary, yard art to an appropriate specialist. In this case, that would be an auto-electric shop. Experience has also taught me the damn thing needs to be running for them to do a diagnosis on it. I\'ve been down that particular primrose path before. Without their equipment, they have to examine the entire electrical system, a very expensive process, and hope like hell they get lucky. If they don\'t get lucky, Repair by Replacement goes into operation   another very expensive process. Two expensive processes do not equal an affordable bill.
Yet, after speaking of God\'s intimate knowledge- he asks him to search him. He asks him to see things we normally want to hide from the Almighty- anxious thoughts, offensive ways. Yet, the psalmist knows what we all know- we cannot hide from God. So if we can\'t hide from Him, then we should ask His help to overcome our faults and weaknesses.
At nearly 19 feet long and dripping with what seems like 500 pounds of chrome, the Cadillac Escalade ESV Platinum is the biggest, glitziest, most conspicuously consumptive vehicle in General Motors\' lineup. The stretched ESV variant is almost 20 inches longer than the regular Escalade, with the range-topping Platinum package (available on both lengths) a,\'ing a new CTS-inspired grille and front fascia, along with super-bright LED headlights and unique 22-inch wheels.
I am not the typical RPG gamer. I have never been a fan of the games where you pick your actions from a menu. This is a real-time RPG. It is wide open from the begining, although one might want to watch where they venture. High-level nasties, and locked doors may block your way. If you are a mage, dispatching the ba,\'ies will come easier. If you are a theif, you can take care of those pesky locks with ease. But, your class is not limited.
I used to watch Dr. Who on PBS with my dad in the eighties.  I am not into sci-fi at all.  My dad is a Trekkie and into the Who series deeply.  Out of all his interests, I shared in Dr. Who simply because it was a series I could follow because it centered around time travel.  Time involves most of what we do so it was practical in a sense.  We have wondered about the validity of the past, the future and how we apply the present.   Dr. Who\'s cast involved real people who were relatable.  In the area I live now, I was quite disappointed to find the local PBS doesnt air Dr. Who.
I paid 100 bucks for this shirt. However, I\'m now able to wear this thing to formal functions, instead of a suit and a tie. Can you believe it? I can wear this to the symphony. I can wear this to we,\'ings-I did today. I have to say that I have procrastinated in making what has become an obligatory purchase.
We are still waiting to hear more details about the ATM crooks. One thing that has the town abuzz is that the news reported on Wednesday that they had confessions from four more guys, three of whom are 18. For some reason, the news has since blacked out and none of the three names have been made public.
Alex Chilton died today from a heart attack. For those of you who don\'t know who he was, he was one of the primary members of Big Star, a band I fell in love with only fairly recently. He wrote some of the most modern-sounding music from the early 70\'s, unfortunately, Big Star wasn\'t as large a commercial success as they deserved to be, releasing only three albums before a long break from recording as a band. It didn\'t help that their recording company didn\'t give them a fair break either.
The big star of today\'s Apple event in San Francisco had to be the latest version of the iPod Nano.

Alright. In order to finally complete my application, I tried another photo on istockphoto.com. This time it\'s from the food and beverage category. Which is a wanted category of photographs as described in their tutorial or Photo Training Manual. If that pic doesn\'t fly, I guess I need new camera equipment. As you probably guessed by now, my approach to istockphoto is this.\'Dude, you take thousands and thousands of photos every year, there must be some stock-worthy stuff in there.
The is a reviewer favorite, and the iPhone 3GS (the S stands for speed) receives accolades as well, although reviewers aren\'t quite as enthusiastic. Available and 32 GB  versions, the 3GS boasts an upgraded 600 MHz processor (up from 412 MHz) and 256 MB of RAM, double that of the iPhone 3G\'s 128 MB. Testing by editors at MobileTechReview.com, PCMag.com and others shows that the 3GS is indeed noticeably faster in loading contacts, email, websites, games and various apps. Other than circuitry upgrades, most of the improvements to the iPhone 3GS are software-based, and many reviewers point out that current iPhone 3G owners can simply download the iPhone 3.0 software for free. Nearly every reviewer recommends buying the new iPhone only if you have the original iPhone or haven\'t yet taken the iPhone plunge.
The Lounge (left) gives your iPhone 3GS or 3G a place to recline, whether on your desktop or on a dashboard, so you can easily view the screen. Its main use is with GPS applications, but it\'s also handy when you want to watch a video. It lists for $49.99.
So, because of my last post, My wife finished both Gary Unmarried and the first season of Frasier with me last night. Enjoyed Gary Unmarried immensely. Frasier is very on again/off again for me. Some are hilarious, some are funny, and some are a waste of 22 minutes. The season ender for me was in the final category. It was nothing like the rest of the show, and for me was a failed experiment.
The 2010 Winter Olympics games are about to begin in Vancouver, Canada, and while it isn\'t the first Olympics since the App Store launched (it was a month old for the 2008 Summer Games), it will be the first to receive massive support from the iPhone community. From tracking the winners, to virtual recreations of the events to apps crafted just for the athletes, the App Store has plenty to offer, and these are some of the best:
I am hoping against hope that President Obama (I can\'t remember when I have to capitalize\'president\') can be successful, and not just because I\'m a Democrat. I am kind of tired to hear the same old opinions that the stimulus plan is too much spending, while at the same time not providing enough tax relief for the upper income brackets. Can\'t anyone acknowledge that supply-side economics didn\'t work?
Oh I may have a few co-workers with me and I know that I will always have plenty to do while at my destination necessitating my businessness (oh yeah, I just made that up), but when all is said and done, the bed just isn\'t as warm without my wife next to me and my child relatively close.
Arrested Development is undoubtedly the best sitcom of the 21st Century, and it never even got a chance to win the hearts of America. This show had a wonderful blend of topical humor and dry wit. In its three seasons - from the pilot, which was extended and became the first episode, to the epilogue in the third season - Arrested Development delivered continuous laughs.
precious the movie is a part 3 of a series that is dedicated to the Faces of Domestic Violence. In part 1 of this series I began telling my friends Sara\'s story that ivolved  emotional and verbal abuse that began with Eli\'s mother who yelled and Screamed at Eli and his Dad. Eventually this domestic abuse began its vicious cycle and transitioned from Eli be abused by his mom to Eli abuing Sara, his wife.
As days go, it doesn\'t seem like a bad day. The sun is casting a golden glow on the branches of the cedar and spruce trees in the front yard. Other than a couple of drifts created by shovel and blower, the snow has retreated to a few spots that will be shaded by trees for another few weeks. The temperature is balmy enough to make T-shirts a viable alternative to coats. Like I said, as days go, it doesn\'t seem bad.
FROM MTV.COM:\'Twilight\'stars Robert Pattinson and Peter Facinelli have told MTV News that their ideal director for\'Breaking Dawn,\'the still-announced adaptation of the final volume in the vampire series, would be two-time Oscar-nominated director Gus Van Sant. An Entertainment Weekly report on Tuesday suggested that Van Sant (\'Milk\') is in fact one of three high-profile directors who have been approached to helm the film, along with Sofia Coppola (\'Lost in Translation\') and Bill Condon (\'Dreamgirls\').
The way Morgan searched for the right BMW was spiritual. Finding a 2002 for two thousand two (hundred. It has connection to his mother\'s memory so when we drove to pick it up in Monterey we also visited an artist friend of hers from High School (Neutrer.) At the reunion Julia reminded everyone (of how prolific Jayne was) by the impressive style of dark outlines of playful imagry and we sat at the same table as Josh Reynolds so we could share Trident stories . . in Chicago!
The next optimization technique, I will be demonstrating is a predicate pushing problem.  Unbeknownst to most developers, SQL Server 2005 does have a problem with predicate pushing in views.  A lot of these issues have been resolved in SQL Server 2008, but should be known.  I will be demonstrating a very simple example, using a ranking function.  Ranking functions are relatively new to SQL Server and were introduced in 2005.  I am sure there are other scenarios that cause predicate pushing problems, but I will only be a,\'ressing the ranking problem, in this post.s
Most of Sunbelt Software\'s business lies in supplying malware protection to its 25,000 Enterprise customers. Sunbelt also licenses its engine and sandbox analysis software to other vendors. But the people at Sunbelt are just as passionate about their consumer product, VIPRE Antivirus 4.0 ($29.95 direct). VIPRE did well in testing, and it offers some bonus features more often found in suites than in standalone antivirus utilities.
This stuff is great; I found it through a friend and well never take aspirin again. Not only is hyland a great company, the products that they offer are budget conscious and effective. It is not necessarily a great head ache cure but it does sooth my daily aches, when necessary.
In Homo Sapiens sapiens, that\'s certainly the case: men try to hoard women, preventing other men from getting access to them, and the morality of\'rape\'is more about keeping women secure and intact from other males than about respecting women\'s wishes or decisions. I\'ve been annoyed, in the\'evolutionary\'discussions of rape I\'ve seen so far, by their careful avoidance of the fact that in the real world, rape is not considered such a bad thing after all, that women are presumed be wanting it secretly, and that men are constantly trying to construct scenarios in which a woman forfeits her right to say No.
As one of the freshest and most interesting videogame franchises today, BioShock is 100% definitely going to get ruined by 2K. BioShock is loved for its amazing setting that will soon be stripped of all mystique and thought-provoking story and continually ret-conned into sterility. Who can forget their first moment they ran into a Big Da,\'y, a videogame character who will be marketed until you can\'t remember why you liked him in the first place?Soon BioShock will too join the ranks of innovative franchises such as Splinter Cell and Guitar Hero which are now unbearable to even look at. Here\'s now:
I was born in sathanur and bought in villupuram & chennai , I lived there for nearly quaterhalf my life before emigrating to the UK in 2010. Much of that time was spent at R.V.M.H.S School and SRM Valliamai Engg College; Originally an Electrical Engineer, I\'ve spent most of my adult life working in that strange places where meets technology, for a number of very large firms. I\'m passionate about the things that interest me. My family, My Lovely temple (Triuvanamalai) , community & My Friends( Subesh,Raghul) . A retarded hippie at heart, I listen primarily to music made in the rock,melodies,carnatic(whatever sound nice to me).. I\'m passionate about my profession(s), both planned and accidental. More and more my interests have moved towards education, therefore in uk for my higher education M.Sc ( electronics and information technology)....
To find classic car insurance quotes you should use the internet. This helps to speed things up quite a bit. In other words, you don\'t have to sit back and wait for an agent or broker to call you back. Instead, you are in charge and taking the initiative. How does that sound to you?
Way back in the 1990s I was at Supercuts one day and the tweeker girl doing my buzz cut became fascinated with my Irish heritage and how that related to my sparse-but-there body hair. Are you Irish? she asked. I\'m not from Ireland, I replied, but my ancestors were.
Not sure where to start on this one, It moved me and brought me to tears. This young girl, Precious Jones, It starts off with her a 16 year old girl. She has no education, and is very overweight. Wannabe father molesting her, Her mother is a worthless abusive figure in her life that resents her for the father molesting her, and her bearing children of his. Precious is abused and discarded thru her life at home, brought me to tears the things her mother said to her. I can see why Monique won the Oscar, ( she played the mother) It had to been a hard role to act.
I spent a lot of time last week cogitating about the topic for my next blog. The ideas that crossed my mind ranged from the mirthful experiences in my college (in continuation of my first blog) to the heavy ones like ‘Hindutva\'. I also thought of writing about my blissful life in school but later decided against it. As I sat down to write about anything which inaugurates my thought process, a much uncomplicated idea came to my mind about the most cherubic and audacious (arguably) person on this heavenly planet. Yes, I am going to write few things about my angelic Mother (though in a slap-stick way!!). Well I am not going to discourse the love that is shared in the mother-child relationship (for that you can always listen to the famous song from Taare Zameen Par). What I am going to talk about here are rules that every mother sets in her house to keep a check on people living under her domain (well in my case, this kingdom consists of me, my brother and dad too!!).   If you are a girl and are reading this, chances are you would not agree. But read on and I am sure you would be convinced.
Then I went out a bought a new truck that had XM built in. At first I missed being able to see the name of the artist and the song at the same time, and I missed not being able to set it to tune to certain songs or artists that I liked to hear more than others...but I got over it!
Lenovo has built a reputation for constructing quality laptop keyboards, as evidenced by those found in its ThinkPad and IdeaPad lines. But a good keyboard has somehow eluded its 10-inch netbook line until now. In a,\'ition to getting new Intel parts, the Lenovo IdeaPad S10-3 ($370 direct) has received a full-size keyboard and the kind of typing experience that has garnered praise for netbooks like the Editors\' Choice Toshiba mini NB305-N410 ($400.00 Direct, ) and the HP Mini 5102 ($400 Direct, ). Unfortunately, while the Toshiba NB305 and HP 5102, which have a roomy touchpad and soft mouse buttons to compliment the keyboards, the S10-3\'s one-piece touchpad does the opposite.
Recently, I was frustrated while trying to package a Java keystore file from my Maven project to a project archive (tar or zip) using assembly.xml. Somehow, when I used the command: keytool -keystore cacerts -list on the certificate keystore inside the tar/zip archive, it would just say that the keystore is invalid. After some search, I found that there is a little setting in the pom.xml which instructs maven not to do any filtering tasks on the files you specify when you execute a maven command.
1. No ice  If your ice maker has stopped making ice then you need to check these things.          1. The lever that controls the ice maker has been pushed up which turns it off. If you have a red lever, pull it down to the wire and if you just have a wire then just pull down the wire to start your ice maker up.          2. Make sure the freezer temperature is below 10 degrees F If the freezer is too warm ice production will be poor because the ice maker will not cycle properly.          3. The ice maker fill tube may have ice formed in it, blocking it. Use a hair dryer to melt the ice. Watch out for the plastic parts, so that you do not melt the plastic. Also check the water inlet valve and the shut off valve, to make sure it is not plugged with debris. The openings in those valves are very small.          4. Check the gears in the ice makers to see if they are broken or stripped. Also look to see if the ice rake is broken. All parts in the ice maker are replaceable individually, If you find broken parts replace them.
Whenever I feel the urge to play the older games, I always whip out Super Mario Bros.3 for the regular Nintendo. It is always fun. These games are the originals. I love playing any Super Mario game no matter for what console.
Yesterday Chief Ican went out to visit Mrs. Westup. He wanted to see the miracle appliances for himself. Amila was happy to see him and to be given the chance to show off the wonderful things that had come into her life. He had her retell him how she got up and found everything there . She hadn\'t been awaken by any noise during the night. Chief Ican thought that was really weird since when they put the new hot water heater in the jail half the town could hear the racket the plumber made.
I traded in my 2003 Ultra Classic (42,000 miles) in August on a new 2009 Ultra Classic. The dealership I bought from was making deals too good to refuse. They even beat a different dealers offer, on a 2008 model no less, by $3000 ! Mine is the new for 2009 Flame Blue Pearl color. It has  turquoise pin-striping as well. So far, having ri,\'en about 2,500 miles, and in 2 other states, I am LOVING it ! It rides smoother and firmer than the\'03 did. I attribute this to the new,wider rear tire/wheel.
It must have been torture for South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone, as all the Tiger Woods events unfolded while they were on hiatus.When you dangle raw meat above a cage of wolves (or tigers), they tend to get hungrier and a lot more rabid - and in Trey and Matt\'s case - a lot more creative.Finally, we get to see what must have been brewing in their deeply disturbed minds all these months with the season fourteen premiere entitled\'Sexual Healing.
Sorry, Schwim-Fans, but Ross Gellar is off the market.As reported by US Magazine, David Schwimmer (43) will soon tie the knot with his girlfriend of three years, Zoe Buckman (24). And yes, your math is correct: Da,\'y Schwimmer took her to get her first legal drink.Actually, that\'s not entirely accurate, as the lucky couple (it\'s the first marriage for both) met in England on the set of Schwimmer\'s successful comedy Run Fatboy Run. And just to be clear, by \'successful,\' I mean, \'only comedy that\'s successfully made Simon Pegg not funny.\' So that means Buckman has possibly been drunk since she was eighteen, which may explain her taste in men.
So happy with it, got it 5 days ago... and more than happy, WiFi, watchin movies, the sound, everything more than cool!
I\'ve always been a gadget fiend, having bought dozens of digital cameras, mp3 players, handheld GPS devices, and cell phones .. now all in one. My favorite things      * design - so clean, plus love the touch screen     * google maps - more than a map, also shows you bus/train options and travel time     * google voice search - much easier to say a few words than to type them     * safari - full on web browser, fast when on wifi     * mp3 player - love my 32gb and sync with iTunes playlists     * all the apps - games, productivity     * and Specific to 3GS - way faster than 2G, and compass makes some apps better, like google maps
It\'s really difficult to settle on any one aspect of this episode that I\'m the most excited about.  I was serious when I noted two weeks ago that Chuck offers more plot progression and character development than any 5 episodes of Lost, and\'Chuck Vs. The Tic-Tac\'offered that, and so much more.It takes guts to remove the fangs of any series\' most bad-ass character, but all our base are belong to Adam Baldwin for handling the birth of, defection and (figurative) death of John Casey with such believable dramatic weight.
In case you don\'t already know, last night I won\'Puckett\'s Rising Star\'competition.  This was a contest held at Puckett\'s Grocery in Franklin among Nashville songwriters judging on song quality and performance.   The contest had three rounds; 8 seperate opening rounds, a semifinal round of sixteen, and a final round of four writers.  (about 120 writers total)
I was born in 1946 and lived outside of Mitchell, South Dakota by the James River I did a lot of hunting, fishing and trapping. There was a rock dam on the river where at one time stood a flour mill. I would spear carp and sell them to a nearby mink farm where they where used as mink food. I went to Riverside grade school, a one-roomed country school house  .then I went to Mitchell Senior High.
Try as I might I just cant seem to get you off my mind. You\'re so much better than any other I could hope to find. No need to be kind I can see you\'ve made up your mind. You\'ve been nothing but an absentee to me, but I know I don\'t want to be free from your grasp. Slippery as it may be.
My across the street neighbor has a two-year old chocolate lab, which turns out to have had serious knee problems in her back legs. (Actually, they are called hocks, but the right word only gets in the way here.)
As much as I liked - but didn\'t necessarily love - Avatar, I absolutely got that it was a big-screen, 3D, IMAX experience, meant to be enjoyed in an immense theater, filled with the latest in cinematic technology and surrounded by fans as emotionally connected to the material as yourself. It was the kind of movie that simply wouldn\'t be as engaging at home, no matter how high the definition in which you watched it...Or how large your television...Or how great your sound system...
Rather than a straight adaptation of Carroll\'s stories, Woolverton has chosen to stage her story 13 years after the events in the books, which essentially makes this film a sequel of sorts; its closest cousin in this arena is another Disney-sanctioned reworking of classic children\'s literature, Walter Murch\'s Return to Oz (1985), an extremely dark and violent product of the Reagan era that has virtually nothing to do with Victor Fleming\'s candy-colored musical. As Dorothy did in that film, Alice returns to Wonderland years later, only to find it enmeshed in conflict and alarm. Both films reunite their young heroines with an array of weird and endearing characters, and interestingly both also feature queens who are obsessed with decapitation (in Return to Oz, the evil queen keeps a closet of assorted heads to \'wear,\' whereas in Alice in Wonderland Helena Bonham Carter\'s Red Queen just likes to cut them off).
The turning point of the game came in the fourth quarter when Clint Sessions picked off Joe Flacco and returned it for a touchdown. And if that wasn\'t enough, Robert Mathis stripped Flacco on the next play and the Colts recovered.
As I drift in and out, I can only hope that you are doing the same. Somewhere else wherever you may lay I hope you dream of delightful days with you and I. Dream of me as I dream of you, Dream of me as only you can see. Dream of me as I dream of me. Dream, just let yourself go ahead and dream...Your all I really care about. And there is no doubt that I\'d wait forever and a day until your ready to be with me 
Have you ever craved an ever-evolving, dynamic music library within the confines of your portable music player?  Did you ever hear a song on the radio...and then wish you could record it on the spot...even if the song was almost finished?  Do you ever get bored with choices of your stale music collection on your IPOD...and wish you had a better source for finding new music, that just isn\'t being played on the FM dial?
Guinness is another beer with a pseudo cult following.  There are people that love the stuff so much they buy hats and shirts to let you know they like Guinness.  Guinness represent something of a different take on beer than most people are use to. It is dark and looks different. I guess people respond to that sort of anti-yellow beer sort of thing. I remember in my younger light beer drinking days I pretty much thought Guinness was a horrible joke. Why would anyone drink something that dark and heavy?
I have just finished reading no exit by William Garvin, out now from Harry Godwin\'s Arthur Shilling Press. Garvin\'s poems are \'science fiction\', but more than that they feel as though they\'re constellated from the debris or rather the \'glitter trails\' of \'science fiction\'. So the first poem begins \'strugatsky sequence. diary]\' and there\'s a beautiful short poem called \'Tarkovsky\', in which the words are printed so close to the edge of the page it\'s tempting to believe in something missing, some clue that makes the poem less strange and haunting.
Where am I? Mi,\'le of no where? Where is coffee shop? Oh... no GPS  First day, we spent all the day in a 15 passenger van. Second day, we only prepare things, such as we went to Wal-mart for foods, pray and get some tools ready for the school. We brought 363 dollars food. Thanks for the campus ministry taxes free sponsor. I was impressed how Abbey Novak got everything ready by her own, especially meals for all of us and for all the kids who are invited to come.
LAS VEGAS—Polaroid fans will be pleased with the company\'s new product line-up announced Wednesday at CES, which marks the long-awaited return of classic Polaroid instant film, along with a modern version of the OneStep instant film camera. In a,\'ition, the company launched new instant ZINK (\'zero-ink\') digital products, including a camera and a printer. The company also showed off its new photo-sharing site, The Polaroid Gallery.Polaroid will offer a modern version of the Polaroid OneStep camera, the PIC 1000, available in a range of colors and based on the classic Polaroid Color 600 Instant Film to produce the iconic instant pictures with white borders.
I guess there\'s not too much to say. There never really is. I\'m stuck in an o,\'\'other\'realm where I have no time to invest in things that would further my own personal happiness but I have all the time in the world to sit and wish I was doing something else. I guess I\'m spoiled, at least a little.  After looking at my last credit card bill, yikes, I picked up freelance writing to fill the cracks my paycheck doesn\'t want to cover and, for the most part, it\'s working well.
Gutter is a new magazine of \'New Scottish Writing.\' I am delighted that I have a poem in their first issue. There are lots and lots of good things in the beautifully designed magazine, so go and subscribe please, here. It is very reasonably priced.
Sony announced the release date today for ModNation Racers: May 25. If you\'re wondering whether that goes for the PlayStation 3 or PlayStation Portable version, the answer is\'both.\'As previously reported, the title is set to launch on both platforms, simultaneously, and with similar feature sets. The title is carrying the torch of Little Big Planet\'s\'Play, Create, Share\'model, with the ability to create and share custom tracks.The blog also outlined the pre-order incentives for the game, which vary according to retailer. Each of the\'Mo,\'e,\'dMighty-Mugg-style racers hails from a well-known Sony franchise (above). GameStop pre-orders will receive Kratos and his\'Kart of Chaos.
I have been toying over the idea of creating a separate blog for my technical wanderings for some time now. Earlier, I had posted some technical posts on my main blog - www.abhishekontheweb.com, but, now, those seem out of place in a blog, which deals with more general stuff, like events, photography, articles (and whatever random thought comes in my mind). As, in the last few years, I have been working on various technologies, especially Java based, I thought of writing about some of the technical ideas that I have been influenced by, technical issues I have been intrigued by, and the upcoming technologies that I am working on. And what better place than to have a new blog just for that.  I would like to put in as much details as possible in my post, else this blog would defeat its purpose.
Ok Fellas, hopefully all the stragglers have caught up and finished the first book by now! We have confirmed that we will have our first meeting Saturday 12/12/09. Do us all a favor and don\'t show up not knowing what the Whole book is about because you didn\'t finish it. You might get voted off the Island...  Our new book for December will be\'Holy Lockdown\', by Jeremiah Camara  http://www.africanbookstore.net/pro,\'etail.asp?prod=NF1401  http://www.amazon.com/Holy-Lockdown-Church-Limit-Progress/dp/0974796700  The first link is from a black bookstore. Support Black Business!! If that\'s not your thing their is also Amazon. (Don\'t worry, no one will know!)
The most hyped game of the year. The rivalry of the decade. Two of the all time best quarterbacks. Home field advantage on the line. There was no way the game could live up to the hype surrounding it leading up to Sunday night. They didn\'t hype it enough. In what will go down as an instant classic in this now historic rivalry, the Indianapolis Colts came from 17 down in the fourth quarter to steal a win from the New England Patriots, 35-34.
I\'m a sucker for bowling alleys. Maybe because Bowling Alone is one my favorite books. Maybe because Ed (Wikipedia entry or IMDB) is one of my favorite TV shows of all time. Maybe because I love the Independence Square. Or maybe because Michelle, the manager is awesome. Maybe because the great Paula Sorensen works there when she isn\'t at the Main Street Coffee Shop and/or singing great songs.
52 Photowalks - I read about this project idea over here. The goal is to get out of the house once a week and walk around snapping photos. I\'m hoping to do\'themes\'or\'areas\'for these walks and I have a list of ideas that I\'m excited about - the difficulty will be finding time. My goal is to do almost all of these walks in the Philadelphia area so at the end of the year, I\'ll have covered a decent amount of the city and surrounding area. I\'ve posted my first one over here although I haven\'t decided on a format for these yet. More to come later.
I never really did fit into the Italian schedule of things here. I usually did my sightseeing during chuisora, Italian siesta time. I headed to the beach typically when everyone else was leaving. I went out to dinner generally hours before everyone else. I visited Cagliari when it was literally empty. What can I say? I had to plan much of my biking around the heat of the day. The sun was too strong for me to sit exposed on the beach in the afternoon. And, I\'m not Italian.
THe NFL Hall of Famer was one of the greatest defensive linesmen of our time when he played for the Los Angeles Rams as part of the \'fearsome foursome,\' and then embarked on a successful television career.
Here\'s one comic-book adaptation I would dearly like to see - Wes Anderson\'s take on Spider-Man. It is a tale of love and photography, of responsibility and revenge; a film so arch it\'s practically humpbacked. For all that, The Amazing Spider-Man is not as much of a stretch as it first appears. Downplay those distracting crime-fighting elements and Peter Parker could easily take his place amid the ensemble cast of The Royal Tenenbaums and The Darjeeling Limited. He is, in short, a very Andersonian antihero.
I took my spare DAB radio into work to listen to whilst I sort the stores out. And I had the misfortune to tune into Planet Rock. But, initially, I gave the station a chance to enlighten me for once. True to its\' output, Planet Rock disappointed me immensely.
I can still remember hearing about Terrorist attacks against Westerners in Saudi Arabia while I was in boarding school and wondering if my parents and brother and sister were alright. Both my parents seemed to be vulnerable at different times to being in the wrong place at the wrong time. It was always such a relief to hear their voice after one of the attacks that got close.
Wii Sports Resort is the follow-up game to Wii sports - the original game that came with the Wii console. THe main differnece besides there are new games / activities is the fact that it incorporates the Wii Motion Plus Adapter. The adapter connects onto the bottom of the Wii mote where the nunchuk would plug into. The new adapter allows for greater sensitivity of the Wii mote, allowing the sensor bar and Wii to pick up more of the actual movoements of the person playing the game.
So, one weekend we were sitting on top of the jungle gym when Roger reached into his backpack and unveiled his most recent acquisition, the price tagger gun from his parents\' store. \'This is the coolest thing in the world. I can stick a price on anything now,\' he said, fi,\'ling with the dial for a bit, then promptly tagging the jungle gym at 88 cents per can. \'See? Now if anyone wants to buy this jungle gym, they have to pay us 88 cents!
That is showing tremendous relative strength, as well as there is a buy signal with our two other indicators. We use Stochastic and On Balance Volume to confirm a move, and they both show buy signals. Place a stop loss order under $16.00 and our target for this company is $25.00
I really think the show would be better if they kept the boys and girls separate until the top two. A two-hour show at this point is impossible to sit through, even with the help of Tivo. Tonight\'s comments from the judges were pretty good for the most part. My comments, in order of appearance:Michael Lynch is by far the best of the guys and will make it to the top few (although DialIdol.com disagrees).Didi was better than expected again. She\'s not my choice by a long shot, but is safe for at least another 3 weeks.Casey was better this week, but I\'m not sure how long he will last. His song choice was not right for him
Ok here we go. I am off the PIP next Friday. That is if I am still there. I found out in my 1:1 today that in a,\'ition to no more sick time, I have 7 hours personal time and 4 hours of vacation time. I am SCREWED!!! Per my Manager I wrote to HR to see what happens should I get sick. I think I already know corporate Americas answer but I will let them humor me. There has to be a law against this but IL being an at will state. So now I am not sure how much longer I will be working there. Sad part I actually liked this job. Starting to look now to leave on my own terms. Insurance is going to be fun as usual but we shall see and we will survive.
Did not win on Friday. In fact, only got one digit right. And another work week starts and it still counts what I do at work. As you can see I didn\'t\'open the box\'by playing those numbers. I guess I\'m lucky! Let\'s see if 2010 brings some surprises. not much news. did not get struck by lightning (yay), did not win the lottery (yay, not). anyway...we\'ll try again
Most photographers would balk at spending $2K for a fixed-lens digital camera, but Leica has a large following, and the Leica X1 ($1,995 list) will find a happy home with many of the company\'s devotees. Like the Leica M8 ($5,995 list), the X1 features an APS-C image sensor—the same size sensor found in much larger digital SLR cameras, such as the Editors\' Choice Canon EOS Rebel T1i ($899.99, )—capable of producing D-SLR-quality images. Though Leica priced the X1 at a fraction of the M8, image quality is still top notch. But when you compare it to cameras from other manufacturers, such as the Lumix DMC-GF1 ($899.99, ) from Panasonic, the X1 becomes much less attractive. Though you won\'t find a camera as small as the X1 with comparable image quality, you can spend far less on larger cameras that offer more features, comparable image quality, faster autofocus, no shutter lag, interchangeable lenses, higher resolution LCDs and HD video capture.
Our local public High School is pretty good. Nice facilities, gang & drug problems that are either non-existent or invisible, and motivated teachers. My wife and I stay pretty involved in our kids educations. One of the things we do, when able and required, is to go over their tests with them to see where things went astray.
If Arsenal get Inter in the next round expect 180 minutes of squeaky bum time with little action. My flat mate (the united fan) reckons Arsenal\'ll get Bordeaux or CSKA Moscow. Obviously I won\'t complain if we do but one thing\'s for sure: If Chelsea got through tonight they\'d definitely have gotten one of those 2 in the quarters so let\'s all be grateful for that and keep our fingers crossed for a United-Barca match up. If we can avoid them enroute we can make the final.  Since Bendtner\'s late winner on Saturday against Hull the stat men have said that Arsenal officially score the most late goals (after 75 mins) in the Premier League. I think any Arsenal fan would probably know that to be true too. I was stood watching the Hull game in the pub and my girlfriend came in after work with about 10 minutes to go and asked if I\'d be grumpy if we drew. We both knew the real answer but I said I wouldn\'t be. I was surrounded by grumpy gooners. That was until Bendtner scored and the place went absolutely ballistic and it felt fantastic. Dan, my other flatmate (the one without a club), was watching with us and as I looked around for him I noticed, what at first glance, appeared to be scuffle. In actual fact Dan had been mobbed in his celebrations by two Arsenal fans in their fifties. It was such a relief and the grin on Dan\'s face as we left the pub was amazing. He said he was thinking about supporting Arsenal and I told him that if he wanted to he was more than welcome but that disappointment is as much a necessity of being a gooner as faith in Arsene Wenger is. In truth I was dead chuffed.
In the spirit of newborns arrivals life has been a little less planned and a little more hectic. One might say we have currently it all under control, but those changes day-to-day or night-to-night. However, on the average we all are currently above water.   Alex has been doing well though; gaining weight, growing, eating, and sleeping.   Nathan is a sponge. He is learning everything and anything. The explosion of words, sentences and thoughts has really begun in full force. His imagination really has kicked in and he trains, planes, and cars have places to go.  As a parent, the little things are really the highlights: a mi,\'le of the night kiss on the forehead from Nathan while snuggling him back to sleep, a toothless grin from Alex while singing to him, measuring tape races with Nathan on the kitchen floor, Alex sleeping on your chest.
I enjoy occasionally going lingerie shopping with my lady, initially out of curiosity about why the heck they cost so much more than men\'s undergarments, but i soon developed a keen interest in finding the right lingerie for my wife, as a way to spice up my sex life. Finding the right lingerie can be tricky; one person\'s cosmetic lift may be another person\'s dysfigurement. It is therefore helpful that a married man should occasionally take time out to go shopping for lingerie with wife, for her comfort, his libido (and money), their bond.  The first step is to determine what shape her body is. is she a pear, a ruler or an apple? A pear is a figure that is curvy. It\'s larger in the hips than in the tummy and has a smaller top than bottom.\'Pears\'generally have large thighs and rears as well. A ruler is a figure that is fairly balanced with little curve. Most\'rulers\'are very slim women. An apple figure is one that is much larger in the chest than in the hips and thighs. A woman who is apple shaped usually has a bit thicker mi,\'le but slim, toned legs. So figure out which figure she has first in order to determine which lingerie style will flatter her body the most.  Once you\'ve determined her shape, the next step is to explore the different styles of lingerie that work with it. You should have a good idea of what styles of lingerie you (you and your other half) are looking for before you go shopping with her. Also be sure to shop at a nice lingerie boutique for the greatest selection and quality.
And then they\'d hang up on me all frustrated. Like I was the idiot. Like I\'m running around town scratching the last digit off the phone number on the printed materials of hotels through the Phoenix metropolitan area. Some nerve I had, not taking their reservation over the phone for the hotel they didn\'t call that I don\'t work at.  It started happening so frequently that I thought about actually just taking the reservations and letting them fend for themselves. Hey, it\'s not my fault they screwed up. But by the time I came to that resolution they stopped calling.  I also used to get calls for somebody whose nickname was \'Golden Boy.\' This would not have been nearly as confusing had his real first name not been Rich.  Hello? What\'s up Golden boy? What? Is this golden boy? I don\'t think so? Is this Rich? Yes. Rich Gulden? Oh. No.  My dad\'s cell phone number used to be 1 off from the towel department at Bed Bath and Beyond. People called him on more than one occasion to get a conversation that went like this.
All of us have probably gone to school, or work with someone who is gay. We probably all got along well and probably still do. No harm came to us or anyone else around them due to their sexual preferences. We are fellow humans after all. The dislike that many exhibit towards them only starts once they make their sexual preferences public and for no good reason other than the fact that society, with its prejudices and ignorance teaches you to despise people inclined towards homosexuality
4:04 am, Los Angeles. I was just shaken awake by what I thought was someone grabbing the bottom of my bed and shaking it up and down. I went down the hall to the reception desk at the Comfort Inn in Monterey Park and I looked at the night clerk who is usually asleep and said, Did something just happen? Yes, he replied. That was an earthquake. I went back to my room and called Braff Zackton who was already at work in Chicago. Braff ran his earthquake search that he does every 30 minutes and informed me that I just rode a 4.4 in the Greater Los Angeles Area at 4:04am. It seems no one else is alarmed but me! That is completely whack and a first for me.
The optimistic meaning of life is what we all search for. Isn\'t it? Always the beauty of something so complicated, is put into such simple words, Soul, Love, Life, Understanding, Acceptance. Everything is so much more, you cannot express it in such simple words. Everyday people die, and no one really recognizes, everyday people form and no one really recognizes it, and why? Because were to busy searching for happiness, were all working, to get somewhere, where we think success is. People strive off of happiness, or the idea of it. Its so hard to find, and often times people think they need to be rich and be very successful to be happy. That is completely irrelevant, happiness is inside of you, within you. When you are completely accepting of yourself, its when you can be happy by yourself, no help from others, to know that if everyone you know left you, you could still be happy at least a little, by yourself. I\'m becoming happy again. Katie Day has helped me become happy again & I want to thank her for that. I just hope it last! I have learned that the people in your life the just wakes up one day and just leaves you behind and act like you dont mean anything to them and it really does make you feel so down in the dumbs you dont want to do anything! Eat, can\'t sleep or even get to the point where you dont even dream good, thats when you just get up and learn to face the fact that they never have two shits about you. Don\'t do what I have been doing, dont not eat, sleep, or even get to the point when you dont even want to do what you really enjoy. I ask you please! Dont do this! Just live you life like im learning to do again.
So this is it for another year - December 31st 2009. I don\'t want to spend for ever ranting on about how my year went....just a brief look back on some of the highs and lows.  2008 was a rough year. 2009 wasn\'t a whole lot better....but, it was better. I encountered similar problems in 2009 as I did in 2008, but felt that I dealt with them better. Kept some of the demons at bay. This is partly due to the medication I had been on, Effexor XR (antidepressant). After being depressed on and off since high school, I finally gave in and tried it. It helped a lot. I hope the black dog never returns but one must always remain cautious.  Sadly, 2009 was a year of confrontation. I don\'t consider myself to be a confrontational person but 2009 unfortunately had several war moments. Confrontation with Hannah, former student, confrontation with Elsa, my ex girlfriend and confrontation with Maree, my ex friend. I had made attempts to resolve these issues with scattered and limited success. No point going into them now, let God be the judge.
So, over the Thanksgiving holiday, when Number one son was home from JHU for the break -- and after we dragged him (and number two son) to the mall -- and got Number one a haircut (actually a trim) -- we wandered the mall as post-20th century consumer zombies are programmed to do.   Hell, somebody has got to keep the economy going.    Compulsively, I used the opportunity to inquire about my sons\' ideas for Christmas and birthday presents.   Number one son is transitioning into real manhood and after mentioning Guitar Legend (a campus rage), asked for a folding chair for his room, new pillows (as the university linens package ones suck), and a vacuum cleaner.  Number two mentioned various Wii videogames that come out in February (sigh).  My number one wife tried to get some group enthusiasm for zipping off to the movie theatre to see Beowulf -- but despite the attraction of Angelina Jolie\'s frontal nudity (albeit\'animated\') -- we decided against what seemed to be an Old English pre-quel to Texas Chainsaw Massacre (well, not in Texas and without chainsaws).  So, upon passing by the Saturday Night Matinee store, we wandered in to seek out some DVDs to buy and watch at home.  This is exactly the behavior that consumer market researchers adore --\'the impulse buy.\'Number one son found\'Enemy at the Gates\'-- a film about the confrontation of a German and Russian sniper during the battle of Stalingrad in 1942.
After a couple weeks on the Job I had become like my 60-68 year old parents, waking up at 5:45 am and going to bed before 9 pm. My social life had been condensed to a quick after work joint with a bu,\'y followed quickly by bed time. This is how I know that life isn\'t too short. When your doing stuff like this, you often think it couldn\'t be any longer.  One weekend I had decided that it was time for Max to play. I had been working my butt of and I wanted to party. So, I left work early one Friday in order to catch a good nap before the evening in order to wrangle the necessary energy for later that night. When I got home everything seemed normal and I was able to quickly fall asleep on the sofa in front of the TV.  I was awoken later that evening by my dad. He asked me if I wanted to go for dinner with him because my mom wasn\'t feeling up to it due to some nausea and she had suggested we just go alone. By the time I had showered and gotten ready my mom\'s condition had taken a severe turn for the worse. She was lying in bed sweating profusely and complaining of pain in her stomach and back. Ten minutes later she was having trouble breathing and was very weak. Needless to say, we canceled our dinner and took her to the hospital. By the time we got to emergency with her she was mumbling, sweating, and could not walk, let alone later hold herself upright on a chair. I had to carry her through the emergency doors, too weak to even hold her arms by her side, allowing them to hang down toward the floor.

I was watching a show on Plane Crashes. They were saying it\'s not one event that causes a crash but a series of events that leads to the crater. Damn that sounds like my life! Yah there\'s a lot of things we can do to hedge our peace of mind but what\'s the bottom line? our happiness or peace of mind because they\'re not the same. Yah I could have got an MBA bought a tire store in some corner of the world and lived out my life golfing raising five kids with the wife and making a difference in Kawanis. If this is you God bless you. I\'ve lived my life listening to that subtle whisper in me\'keep asking more of yourself keep growing!\'My art is  humor my canvas my life. There isn\'t a single time I haven\'t been on stage that I haven\'t learnt something. I have chosen a life of pressure: corporate comic, comedy clubs, teacher, Key note speaker but there are things I can do to guarantee results: Keep finding ways to reinvent myself, keep looking at my goals and make sure my habits grow with them, keep re discovering ways to grow in my industry. I thought about the events that lead to a wreck. I can use this same criteria to examine my personal  program. When I first began stand up my inner thought was panic. All my results came from that. Panic was what I sent out and what I got back. My thought now is\'let\'s explore follow me.\'My results are discovery and growth. If single events lead to result make sure your core thought is attracting the results you want. Our core thought determine whether we fly or crash achieve our destination or stay stuck.
Politics on Tuesday? Easy: Repubs Are the Danger  At this point, who on the right is still ki,\'ing themselves: Republicans are not for actual medical reformation. They never have been. They want to keep their corporate medical sponsors (granted, it\'s been hard for the Dems with their corp med sponsors too). But the \'Pubs haven\'t put effort into anything except NOT putting effort into the reform Americans are desperately in need of.  Wait, that\'s not true. Repubs are putting a great deal of effort into scaring the hell out of the ignorant American populace that the (Obama v. 2.1) USA is going to take over their health care. And KILL US ALL! It\'s true. Ask Beck or Limbaugh or any of those other conservative ass-clowns who claim an allegiance to a more pure form of American government than the Republicans. And everything Obama does is bad and wrong and is deliberately so. Obama hates America!  So the Democrats have to go and the Republicans who don\'t get the AM Radio Stamp of WhateverTheFuck (most of them) ALL NEED TO GO. And by fostering that level of ignorant voting rampage, and ignorant Tea Party education, you foster a frenzy-dom of stupidity, a madness of idiocy, all of them suckling on the teat of talk radio like a crack baby on its amphetamine-laced lactation.   Right wing radio: you\'re right. America is in danger. America is in danger from you. YOU are fostering not an educated populace, but an ignorant one. You are fostering your dream of an oligarchy ruled by madness that fits your version of reality.  You are the danger.  And as disconcerting as it is, I say: Bring it on. Usher Palin into 2012. Kill reform without solutions. We\'ll be waiting. With facts. And you will lose.
Windy here this afternoon; gusts up around thirty-five MPH. Sitting here a bit back staring out my window, sipping a taste of Wild Turkey when I saw a cloud of newspapers sailing by. I ain\'t talking here about a few, but a go,\'am blizzard of them.      I had a flashback to a year or so ago when I looked out there and saw a few thousand plastic grocery store bags flying around, most of which got hung up in my pine trees. Remnants of some of them bags are still hanging around.      Carrying my glass of Wild Turkey, I strolled down to the road to see what I could see. What I saw was a vortex of newspaper raising from Ms. Graham\'s backyard and heading my way. I also saw Ms. Graham running around in the road trying to snatch her runaway newspapers out of the air. She wasn\'t having much luck.      I like Ms. Graham, seventy-two year old retired school teacher, and subscriber to about nine newspapers, which, after reading, she piles in a stack on her back patio for a year or two.      I walked on down to her. She was sort of shook up that her stash of  newsprint was blowing off in a N/E direction and getting hung up on mailboxes, power lines, trees and such.      I suggested to her it was not that big a deal; that newspaper would rot right into the ground pretty soon.\'Besides,\'I told her,\'if I run out of toilet paper any time soon, I\'ll just go out and pluck some off my trees.\'You might think a seventy-two year retired school teacher wouldn\'t find that funny.       You\'d be wrong.
You hear many vhristians claiming that their god is the absence of evil.  They usually start their conversation with things like\'dark is the absence of light\'and\'heat is the absence of cold\'.  There is even the hoax letter that has been going around for years now about the student who supposedly one up\'s his mean evil atheist professor, using the very things said above.  In some versions it is said that Einstein did it, either way not only is it a fake and one of the worst christian arguments, it also provides one of the best counter arguments against such a god.        I go over this in the form of a reductio ad absurdum in a previous blog,\'A Different Look at the Problem of Evil\', but lets form it into a direct argument against the god presented above. 1) God is pure good, the absence of evil. (Matthew 19:17). 2) If god is the absence of evil, then evil exists only where god is not.  3) God is omnipresent, he is everywhere.(Psalm 139:8, Jeremiah 23:23,24) 4) Evil exists.  5) Therefore God does not exist So, either: 1. God does not exist or  2. God is not the absence of evil or  3. God is not omnipresent Your thoughts?   Please be respectful in your debate.
I always joked around whenever I heard Roy Orbison sing his\'You Got It\'song that he would have to spend a lot of money. He says that anything his girl wants, needs, or anything, he would give it to her. I knew that he was just speaking metaphorically, but it was still a little humorous to think that she could sit there and go:\'Okay...I want a car, a yacht, a pony, etc.\'So, if Roy was truthful, he would spend a mass of money on his girl. This song is dedicated to that mindset, and to all those guys in those types of relationships.  Let me just clarify: this, thank God, is not how my relationship is with my fiance. It is just the stereotypical relationship with girls.
Sometimes things are perfect.  When you find something perfect you then realize the other experiences you might compare to, you thought were perfect, weren\'t. They might have been really good or above expectation, but not perfect.  At 37 and a lover of food and restaurants I can count on one hand the number of perfect dining experiences. It takes a lot to pull it all together; location, atmosphere, food, drink, numerous employees that all have to be on target and in tune with you and your party.  So here is the place I now get to a,\' to my perfect spots: Canoe.  Here are  the moments I want to capture (and I will not go through all of them as there many more highlights):  The grounds were beautiful. I know, grounds. I come from southern cal where grounds are the parking lot and the shrubs in front. Canoe is on the Chattahoochee river in Atlanta Georgia, nestled in a community of incredible estate homes. There is a walking path that winds through lawns with lovely flowers and plants all under the shade of mature trees.  They even had set some tables out on the lawn for a small party of 4 couples. They were right next to the water front a good 50 feet from the back porch of the building. While I was there they set up the tables and seated the 8. They seemed to really enjoy themselves and it was hard not to be impressed with this extra effort of having the wait staff travel the distance.
Early 20\'s and just moved from the small town to the big city. I have two jobs working in sports radio as well as at a college sports tv station in the greatest city of all, Chicago. College graduate of North Central College, class of 2008. High School graduate of Coal City High School, class of 2004. Not a whole lot else to know about me. Although I no longer play any actual sports I do enjoy pick up games of basketball and 7 on 7 football as well as being the best 16\'softball player in all of Chicago. Any other questions, ask me.
Have you ever wondered what is your purpose, beyond\'what god has in store for you\'or whatever your religion says. Some people would say to make better in the world, but others really don\'t believe they have much of a purpose. My thought is that its genetically ingrained into us to drive on to do whatever is in our power to keep the race alive.  In essence we\'re clinging to life like some sort of single-celled life form, such as a disease. All that disease does is travel from host to host until it dies. Our\'hosts\'are what drives us to strive onward, for example: money, drugs, sex, the people we love, whatever you want.  With that comes Darwin\'s theory of evolution. If we just keep reproducing, theoretically after maybe millions of years we\'d evolve to adapt to what would be essential for survival.  That leaves the question... is there a \'perfect specimen? Could we attain a level of never needing anything to survive and if so, would that mean immortality? It\'s an interesting question, something to ponder upon.  Once immortality is achieved, the primal need to survive will have been fulfilled. And we are still left to wonder, what is our purpose?
Well, here i am, back at home sitting in my favourite chair. Back to normality, whatever that may be.  The good news is that i did manage to drag myself out of bed at a sensible time, and even had enough time for some breakfast before we left the flat for the last time. We did go for one last look at the beach before we jumped in the car and began the long journey home.  I drove for the first hour and a half! As far as Scotch Corner Services in fact. This is, i think, the longest i have ever driven in one go, my previous longest being the hour from our house to Derby. I thought i did pretty well, and i only managed to scare Sally once - well, the bloke in front shouldn\'t have braked while i was checking the mirror should he?!  Saly drove the rest of the way home, and we got home around 2pm, which was earlier than we expected to - 4 and a half hours in total - a good 30 or so minutes less than we thought it would take - mind you, in the 90 minutes i spent driving we shifted a bit!! ;-)
I think that the book of Job was written for this very reason. Here we have a man who is deeply blessed of God. Things have gone so very well for him. And su,\'enly it all goes wrong. Not just slightly but deeply and in every way. Has he done wrong? Has he been spurned by God? No!  Job is never able to see the heavenly things. He is never shown the events of Satan\'s desire to tempt, and test Job. He is not shown God\'s pleasure in Job\'s upright living. He is never shown any of these things. But he is called to trust that God is in control no matter what. He is in control and powerfully good even if our feelings are wrong.  It is a beautiful test to be given the opportunity to have faith even in the depths of this dark night of the soul. We are called to yell out like Job from the ashes.\'He said, \'Naked I came from my mother\'s womb, and naked I will return there. The Lord gives, and the Lord takes away. May the name of the Lord be blessed!\' In all this Job did not sin, nor did he charge God with moral impropriety.\'(Job 1:21-22)  Why do we think that just because he doesn\'t feel close that he is not close? Why do we place so much emphasis on feeling? As if it was the deciding factor in our salvation, or God\'s relationship to us.
This concludes that the most caring doctor in town is one suffering from multiple problems him/herself; it doens\'t make the doctor the most capable, but certainly most empathetic. I am one. Eeerrughhhhhh! *retches* oh thats my breakfast looking blended!Last night hanging out with friends was awesome! Derek and I cruised through our Alma Mater, went to the mall, cruised back through, told stories, laughed, had genuine great conversation, and then met friends for pizza. It was awesome. I saw people I hadn\'t seen in years. My abs hurt this morning because I laughed so much yesterday. I think Derek is the funniest person I know. And that was amazing. And then today I get a letter in the mail from unemployment. I\'ve been denied benefits. FML. And tonight we\'re getting together for an\'I have too much alcohol in my house and you all should come drink it\'party at my friend Katie\'s house. So...it\'s perfect timing.
I understand that while the first few days might be typical for a class, it shortly becomes their hardest and most grueling block with the pure mass of data they require you to learn.  This weeds out anyone that can\'t handle the workload right off, and anyone who is  not serious about animation.  It also gives student a good strong base to start with the 2nd block, which I understand to be mostly animation and mocap.  I think 3rd block covers the more advanced features, like visual effects and green screen.  And finally, 4th block is one big long class project.  Students have very limited creativity in the class assignments.  While they are encouraged to come in before or after class, and on weekends, to work on their own projects, so they can build their demo reel up and their skills, the class itself acts more like an actual animation studio, where the directors call the shots, and the animators have to make it happen.  Therefore, we have to act like animators to make their vision come true.  Students will have some limited creativity within each shot, but the majority of it is just to make the scene work the way it should.
For those of you who thought Luke Harangody was bound for NBA greatness and never going to play a game for the Fighting Irish again, you were wrong. After testing out the NBA routine, working out for a few different teams, Harangody has decided that staying in college is not such a bad idea after all.  I\'m not going to say that this is a great move either way for #44. What I do know is that his lack of defensive ability would have severely hurt his potential minutes on an NBA court next winter. He has proved that he can score in the Big East and grab absurd amounts of rebounds. However, he needs to be more of a defensive threat if he hopes to play in\'the league\'for any extended amount of time.  I\'m not bashing Luke Harangody, the kid is one helluva college basketball player who has been as good as any in the Big East over the past two seasons. His body size puts him at an extreme disadvantage for a big man in the NBA in terms of being able to back down opponents and score the same way he does so often in Big East play.  The good news for Fighting Irish fans is that in the Big East even you are able to get away more with some of the flaws that NBA souts see in Harangody\'s game and that next year should be another outstanding offensive campaign for the Fighting Irish forward.
I figured while I was unemployed, I would try to do something useful. One thing I thought somebody might benefit from was a Facebook page that gives advice on finding a job. (Here\'s the link) Then I thought about the things going through my mind these days as I struggle to stay positive and engaged in the face of a job market that isn\'t exactly smiling upon those over 40. Finding a job in this economy is tough for anybody, but being over 40, you might start asking yourself things like,\'Do they think I\'m too old to do this?\'Well, listen, now you have a chance to prove to them that you are capable, talented, and right for the job. Some people develop a lot of negative self-talk and that negative attitude begins to show through on the surface. Not many employers can afford to hire someone who is late to work, can\'t spell, doesn\'t produce results, has so much drama in their life they aren\'t present at work, etc. So you\'re still in the game, old-timer! I created the Over 40 Unemployed Facebook Fan page as a place where people (you don\'t have to be over 40 and unemployed) can share their experience, their strategies, their job search tips, and their success stories.  I believe that in this economy, if you\'re over 40 and unemployed then all the more reason to work harder and work smarter. It\'s a chance to show how all those years of\'experience\'can benefit a potential employer.  And here\'s the logo I created for the Over Forty and Unemployed Facebook page:
Today was an absolutely gorgeous day... I aerated much of the lawns and over-seeded them as well... I will finish in the morning. I wanted it completed before Saturday as we will go from 60\'s back into the 30\'s with rain and a possible snow storm. There is way too much to water in the seeds and I will have to leave that to spring rains. I\'m not particularly concerned about the cold, as magnolia buds don\'t appear to be swelling... at least not yet.   I thought I\'d talk a bit today about fall planting....why plant in the fall? The answer is a simple one... deals, deals, and more deals!! ... and when the deal isn\'t to my liking, I simply say... \'Let\'s make a deal\'... and frequently they do. Let\'s discuss this past fall for instance. Below is a whole lot of plants that I got for 50-75% off. This particular nursery was having a sale and not discussing lowering the prices any further.... but they were cheap enough to spur me into the purchase. The downside is that there was no warranty... then again, I seldom lose a plant that has been carefully chosen. A good shot of rooting hormone and they seem to take right off!
Bella is over the chicken pox. She returned to school today. All said, it was a very manageable case. Not super-mild, but not super-bad either.  Perhaps it took having the chicken pox to nudge Bella over the edge of readiness to ride a bike without training wheels. In the midst of the pox, she asked me to take the training wheels off. She practiced coasting in the driveway. The next day, she was getting the start-off and some wobbly pedaling down. Yesterday, she had nailed it. She\'s still perfecting the brakes, but she has completely mastered the start-off, pedaling, and steering.  Now it\'s time to get her a bigger bike. As you can see in this video, hers is too small. I\'m not sure if she\'ll get one for Ayyam-i-Ha, which is less than 2 weeks away. It might wait till her birthday in June. Although with us packing up to move, she might get a\'bike coupon\'for her birthday, redeemable in whatever city we move to.
One of the reasons is that we are all different.  When we hear someone telling us something difficult they are going through, we usually think,\'Well, I would do this, and things would be fine,\'but we aren\'t the other person.  It happens alot with disagreements, too. We think to ourselves,\'I would never do that to someone else.\'True, you wouldn\'t but they might.   Empathy is moving our\'self\'filter that we see life through aside, and trying to understand where the other person may be coming from.   I admit, I am the worst person when it comes to putting my emotional response on hold, and trying to understand where the other person is coming from. Did I grow up with them? Did I have their parents? Their family? Did they have any issues along the way that may effect the way they deal with difficulties?  My wife got exasperated with my Male,\'fix the problem\'response to her issue, and told me to,\'Just listen\'. I\'m better than I used to, but I still react in my Male DNA way. However, empathy is more than listening - it is taking a step or two to understand where someone is coming from.  Do you have a friend/family/co-worker that seems to be constantly involved in the same issue or situation. It seems like they are on a racetrack life path that takes them around and around through the same situation. To me, you have two ways to deal with it;
I follow a lot about politics and I despise, yet appreciate the strategy behind the rhetoric. However, I don\'t know if I\'ve ever been more disgusted by a blatant attempt to mislead followers into a false sense of appreciation than what Metallica is now attempting to do on YouTube. After having spent years suing any fan or distribution outlet they could find who mentioned their work online, they have now taken the obvious plunge into the realm of\'if can\'t beat \'em, join \'em\'with the hopes that fans won\'t realize their record. Watch Lars choke back his resentment of his publicist in the video below. Seems genuine enough, don\'t you think? Please, stop spending money supporting this band. They are the epitome of why the recording industry is missing the point and destroying itself by mistreating fans. They are now embracing tools they have fought against not because they believe in them or appreciate what they facilitate, but because they see the possibility of the revenue it will bring them. Makes my skin crawl a bit.
This is purely an opportunity for me to stand up and admit I was wrong. A couple of seasons ago I would watch Arsenal play and spend a good 80 minutes of the game going: \'We need to get rid of Denilson, Eboue and Song they\'re absolutely awful. Why can\'t Wenger see that?!\' Now I only spend 20 minutes of the game complaining, and that\'s only when Denilson\'s on the pitch.  Since Song has been suspended we\'ve looked decidedly dodgy in the mi,\'le of the park. Yes of course that also has to do with the absence of Fabregas (and to some degree Ramsey), but Song has grown over the last 2 seasons to become a talented rock of a midfielder and he has finally come into his own. He\'s taken on the role left by the ridiculous departure of Flamini (who?) and we are a weaker unit without him. Yes he has his shaky moments where you\'re left asking why he made a forward run leaving a gap at the back, or when he puts the ball out for a Stoke throw when he could have passed it back to Almunia. All in all though my faith has been restored in all things Wenger. He is with the players day in day out on the training field and I am not. Everybody was questioning his re-signing of Sol Campbell. It\'s now officially the best signing of a quiet January transfer window. Without Sol we probably would have lost at Stoke.
In the fitness and nutrition field it\'s vital that you continue to educate so science doesn\'t pass you by. New research is reviewed and released almost every day that can have a lasting effect on your programming, so where do you go to keep up?  I link to many of my favorite sources on the sidebar, but there are a few that haven\'t made it up yet. Here\'s a short list of some that I\'ve found educational:  The Fitcast : http://thefitcast.com/ I\'ve been able to listen to snippets of their podcasts on my short drive to work, and the knowledge that Kevin, Leigh, Dr. Fass, and sometimes Tony bring to the table is wonderful. Weekly interviews with top industry professionals brings the listener several different views on varying topics. It\'s also great that, should I feel the need, I can just drop them a few questions to answer on the next episode. Go ahead and subscribe to the podcast through iTunes and see what it\'s all about. They each have their own blogs that I\'ve found to be very informative.
A few days ago I showed Ronald and Cale...two eight year olds that are rapidly becoming a pain in the ass...how to make tin can telephones. They come around often now wanting to know about more \'new\' and \'neat\' things.      Today they discovered my bomb shelter...yeah, I got a bomb shelter here; a real built in maybe the early fifties bomb shelter. Underground over there  to the north thirty-six steps away from the house; just a big concrete box in the ground with a steel door, concrete steps leading down, air pipes and such sticking out of the top.       Ronald and Cale were tagging along behind me this afternoon and fate led me over that way.\'WHAT\'S THAT?\'hollered Cale, staring down the shelter steps.       If I had been hooked up to a lie detector, I\'d have said the same thing:\'That\'s where my vampire lives,\'I said.      There is no electronic instrument on the market today that could have measured the speed with which two young set of eyebrows shot up at that news, and I swear the temperture dropped a few degrees from the cold chills running up and down a couple of small backs.      My offer of letting them go down there and peep in at my vampire was flatly refused. Ronald and Cale are of the modern world; they know not to screw around with vampires.      But if the cops show up here any time soon inquiring about vampires, I\'m gonna know right off the bat who ratted me out.
Most everyone around the world is prejudice in different ways, some more extreme than others; but no matter how extreme the prejudice is it will always have a negative effect. People have always had and will always have their differences, but we do not have to be so ignorant and discriminate against different ideas, races, sexual orientation, or religions;(even though most denominations cause discrimination themselves.)Though I also don\'t agree with people slapping other people in the face with their life styles. Whether it be a racist not treating one person as fairly as the other for obvious reasons of being a racist, or a very religious person telling you what their beliefs are for the consequences of your actions while trying to convince you that they are right about what they are telling you.

Now I know why Cats kill Birds...  Current mood: unwanted  I don\'t know what it is about the Birds but it seems like there\'s not enough room in their nest for me. Not only that but in their eyes the old wise owl is losing her wisdom and had led a cat into their tree.  That\'s not the worst part though... Mother Hen speaks of me as the creature. She speaks to me of me and see\'s me as no more than a nucience. I feel so ashamed and poorly of myself for I do not want to disturb the nest. All I want is to find a home. Not only a place to live, but a place I prefer to spend my free time instead of trying to find ways to stay out. A place where I am appreciated and loved for who I am, what I did, and what I am going to do. Instead, I am swarmed by Birds who claim that the cat is untidy and do nothing but stay around and eat. To me, their harsh continuous churpping hurts me more than a step on the tail. All I want is to forget the past and work for my future, but it seems even birds can\'t do that...
Like i used to disgard people coming back complaining of pain after a hernia op, asking for lots of painkillers, until i had it done myself and geee, i started to appreciate the real pain; since then i always believed in people, apart from the occasionals who are blatently whingers.  I have thought nothing of the nausea of Mefloquine as an anti-malarial until ... about now. I have just taken one tablet 2 wks before flying away to Kenya and already i am feeling.... soooo sick, not yet a vomit, but sick. Im feeling the tablet blubbling up and burning in my stomach and i keep on burping. May be i shouldn\'t have taken it with an empty stomach.  This concludes that the most caring doctor in town is one suffering from multiple problems him/herself; it doens\'t make the doctor the most capable, but certainly most empathetic. I am one. Eeerrughhhhhh! *retches* oh thats my breakfast looking blended!
Come, stain my skin. splash the puke you wa,\'le in on my bare back and burn its stench on the parchment with the glowing cigar with smell of steak, drawing smoldering pictures of broken chains and fucked up dreams burnt with jagged edges on the skin and when you burn out the cigar stub it out and flip me over and bite my nipple to suck up the red ink and write more, write bold with your tongue till I drag your head up and kiss you hard claiming the blood that is mine. back.
A couple of weeks ago, I was waiting at a traffic light, when a frantic woman came to my window saying she and her family had broken down on the highway; Could I help? She needed money.  I dipped into my pocket and found a $20 bill and handed it to her and moved on, leaving her behind.  Did she break down? I don\'t know. Am I a wuss for giving her the cash? Probably.  But, something has happened to me over the past few years. I\'ve learned from my failures that my successes are not that important, that it\'s important to stay in the mindset of failure, to be empathetic of those who are not as fortunate and to remember that success is often lucky.  So, as I looked at this, I wasn\'t going to judge. I was going to help.
I loved reading about Vijendra Singh - the boxer who became popular after winning an Olympic medal this year. Here is very good write up on his life done by INDRANI RAJKHOWA BANERJEE from Times of India. Here we go!  A rugged village boy who rubs shoulders with the swish set and flirts with Bipasha Basu, Olympiad boxer Vijender Singh is aware he is an outsider. He is proud of his rustic roots and fights prejudices with charming confidence and a quiet dignity.  First things first. What do you look forward to when you set out to interview a hot-blooded Jat boxer? You would expect him to look you over and size you up mentally or probably greet you with a few colourful expletives... especially when the guy is a 24-year-old basking in newfound glory. But this one is different. He throws a disarming smile as his eyes meet your eyes and stay right there! That\'s Vijender Singh Beniwal for you, India\'s lone boxer to have won an Olympic medal.
I am becoming intense. It isn\'t a goal. I don\'t have a plan toward achieving intensity. It\'s an observation.  I didn\'t start out this way. I was laid back and relaxed for what I think was most of my life. In fact, there was the time my golf coach encouraged me to develop a temper and some intensity. A Sr. Minister with whom I worked said I didn\'t take my mistakes seriously.  A lot has changed. I\'ve changed. I am becoming intense.  So, I am looking for peace this coming week. I am intentionally seeking silence and peace. I will listen more and speak less. I will think before I react. I will be less intense. I will practice the Divine Hours. I will remember serenity. I will look to be more at peace.  I make a promise to myself.I seem to march into quandaries. I don\'t think I do it consciously, but the result is the same as if I willfully looked for trouble. It worries me.Tomorrow is the primary here in KY. It\'s irrelevant at this point it seems. The DNC has really messed this whole process up to the point to where a stalemate was bound to occur. Still, I am going to the poll tomorrow and I will cast a ballot. I can\'t bring myself to believe that any vote is irrelevant in a nation that depends on participation.
So, by now, I would imagine that if you are reading this, you\'ve probably heard that I am no longer in the Kendalville-based metal band, Forthcoming. Well the rumors are true. I made the decision about a week ago to part from the guys, and get my life on track. There\'s still some uncertainty in my head as to how I stand in the eyes of everyone else in the band. Here is how I see the situation:     I am a devout christian, and everything Forthcoming stands for is based around Christ, and I love that aspect of the band. Second, I couldn\'t have asked for a greater group of guy to perform with for the year I was in the band. I learned a lot from all of them, and looked to all of them like family. Being the youngest in the band by quite a few years, I got to pretty much experience having 3 older brothers that I didn\'t get to have growing up. Joe, Jeremy, and Jake, no matter what, I\'m always going to love you guys. I want you to know that.
I\'m getting older every day and I am trying to photograph as many of those days as possible. I am Husband to 1, Da,\'yo to 5, Grand (Poppy) to another 5 (so far). I use Nikon Cameras and Lenses ... but I really believe that anyone can be a great photographer with ANY kind of camera. Photography has been great therapy for me throughout my life. It has allowed me to get away on my own and with close friends to see the wonders of creation. I am trying to record something in photography that will live longer than myself. I think it would be really fantastic if my great-great grand-children could see the photos I capture and in effect\'see through my eyes\'but for a moment. Thank you so much for your kind words of support and encouragement. I hope you enjoy what you see and are challenged in new ways to improve your own skills. All of your photos help me learn and improve in that same way. God bless you all.NikonSniper Steve
After weeks of planning the day is finally here. Yesterday we hung the decorations and started getting everything ready. The party starts tonight at 7PM. You can grab some food at the Grilled Cheese Truck which will be parked outside. Inside Japan LA will be lots of Mr Toast products to check out, including a new black Shaky Bacon shirt which was printed up at the last minute by Monkey in a Dryer!  Next door to Japan LA is the Mr Toast Party Space, a whole empty store to hang out in. We will have a DJ, free Pabst Blue Ribbon beer and even Mr Toast hanging out so you can take you picture with him. It should be a fun, wonderful, silly event.
I admit that I fall for girls pretty easily. And that has been the cause of many of my relationship downfalls. I think that many women believe that when I open up my feelings that strongly to them that such things aren\'t sincere, that this is a product of loneliness. I can\'t really blame them. I too have been skeptical of such things when directed at me. And a look at the myriad of different personalities of significant others of my past and I begin to even doubt my own sincerity.  But I believe what it really is about me is that I have a tendency to look deeper into the person, to sympathize with their shortcomings, and to fall for the person that I know is in there. I feel that with an open-mind, I can grow to like or love anybody with time. Maybe that\'s my inner counter-culture flower child speaking. It doesn\'t help my situation though. I easily make friends and lovers but I can\'t keep an intimate companion for the life of me.
I have the idea in my head of what I want the completed piece to look like. However, as this is my first attempt at such an endeavor, it is, as might be expected, taking an inordinate amount of time. At this point though, I\'m comfortable enough with my rate of progress to post up the original and declare that soon, the finalized or near-finalized version should be up as well.  I hope you enjoy looking at my art, and if you\'d like to see more of my abstract designs or rough sketches, please let me know! Anything Box I collect things that I think are neat or interesting, and I place them in an empty harmonica box in a drawer. Recently I was talking to somebody who wanted to see them so I subsequently took this photograph of all the bits in there. I think it looks pretty neat.   Photobucket   I will explain what all the items are starting from the top.  The four steel towers at the top are tapered roller bearings from a wheel bearing of a truck. They\'re made of extremely hard steel which is one reason I kept them. As an experiment, I placed these four in alternate directions between two hard drive magnets. After several months, when I removed them, the atoms had been realigned and the bearings are now notably magnetized.
So yesterday was my first weekend shift. It was from 12PM-11PM, but I didn\'t show up until 3PM. Lol, it had completely slipped my mind. I had woken up around 1PM and made breakfast and stuff. As I got out of the shower, I was like,\'Holy shit, I was supposed to be at work right now\'. Needless to say, I got dressed and drove to work.  I was assigned to a new trainer named Lauren. I think she mentioned that she trained Katherine, not entirely too sure on that. Anyhoo, Saturday was a pretty lax day comparatively. I had begun to practice documenting on a notepad and then entering in the computer system. I\'m getting the hang of it, but there\'s still so much to learn about the whole thing. I met a lot of new people on Saturday. I guess it was because that\'s when most people worked, considering they are around my age but a little older.
The honorable mention of the day was a girl who came in complaining about abdominal pains. The killer here is that she said she was mainly having cold symptoms like runny nose and congestion, but nonchalantly mentions the fact that she hasn\'t pooped in a week. She also said that was normal for her. O_O Didn\'t poop for an entire week! Wouldn\'t you be a little freaked out by that?! I just about lost it. I couldn\'t get over it...I still can\'t.  I also think I had drank the most coffee in one day than I ever had in my life. It was three cups. It wasn\'t because I was tired or anything. Caffeine has minimal effect of me. The coffee just tasted sooo good. In the physician\'s lounge, scribes are allowed to go in on the weekends because it\'s not as busy I guess. Anyway, they have coffee machines that have these little one-cup packet thingies that you insert into the machine. I forget the brand name of them, but they taste amazing.  That\'s pretty much I had to say about Saturday I guess. It\'s harder to blog about it the day after, I suppose. Anyhoo, until next time.
First group of onions planted...  Sudarshan Suryawanshi - IDE India - Drip Irrigation Expert - visited our farm yesterday... Sudarshan said we are doing better with the IDE Drip Irrigation systems than the two major Agri Universities in Honduras... We held our first meeting of Honduran Campesino farmers at our Center of Operations...  We are receiving reports of how there are those who hold top positions as Agri directors for major Honduran NGO´S... Who do not want the IDE systems at our farm... Hah! You will not stop our work...  I have said for years... The help must go directly to the organized Honduran Campesinos... Most of the Agricultural NGO´s in Hondurans are dinosaur institutions... Who only promote sustainable famine projects...
Six years later I lay at night and think about love and I have moved on to find happiness cause that\'s what she would have wanted. There is some one that I do love now, and would give her my heart. I know I\'m not handsome or the man that I was 6 yrs ago with my looks. But my heart is big and kind. I would never be mean to her nor make her feel sad or down. I would give her the world and so much happiness if she would be mine. I know she\'s been hurt and afraid but with me I would protect her and be there every day. I lay awake and count the stars wondering why I\'ve been alone for so long. I would give her my heart cause its who she is that I care so much about. For my heart beats for her. I just wonder if her heart will beat next to mine.
What can you say about a fertility doctor who detonated a twenty-ton hydrogen bomb?   Quite a bit, actually, and most of it good. Juliet is one of the more accomplished characters in the Lost universe, male or female, and a lot of what she did doesn\'t seem to have any significant connection to her gender, unlike being a love interest (like Kate), a mother (like Claire), a dedicated wife (like Sun), or a bullet-ri,\'led corpse that men can shed tears over (like Shannon, Ana-Lucia and Libby).  Before I get into it, however, I\'ll point out to anyone reading this series for the first time that I was inspired to look at how gender works on Lost and whether the show\'s female characters seem to suffer especially dreadful hardships in comparison to the men. I was motivated to consider this after reading and the A.V. Club\'s review of the \'Dr. Linus\' episode. The article suggested that women on the show do get screwed over, and I\'m starting to think that it may be true.  Here are the previous posts that focused on Lost\'s ladies, with a quick summary of whether the character in question got put through the ringer:
As an undeniable WASP whose North American ancestry goes back to the colonial period, I usually keep my opinions of Israel\'s behavior to myself.  Such is my concern for the typical whiplash from many of my fellow citizens who remain ensconced in a sort of Israel-right-or-wrong mindset.  But in the current Israeli issue before the US—Israel\'s continual building program\'s encroachment on Palestinian land—while we are sacrificing treasure and lives in the Mi,\'le East and continue to suffer financial stress at home, I am unable to keep my mouth shut.  Israel\'s recalcitrance mit gewalt, so to speak, is insane.
Falling awake between the vastness of time and space Burning alive surrounded by boiling skin Perpetual nosebleeds pouring blood out the rim Mentally wiped out from the world\'s rat race.  Lingering in limbo between insomnia and hibernation From this place I need liberation For sleep is where I begin thought cultivation Germination of motivation for my imagination.  Without sleep our minds are more open to be manufactured The elite lulling you into the facade of the rapture The brain stuck inside a cell, captured While our ability to learn the truth has been fractured.  But I digress from this stress before creating a mess. If I could I would regress to words previously at my access. But as for now I\'ll express myself to excess. The living game of chess to which we obsess will diminish your finesse and halt life\'s progress. Yes I transgress, to which I confess with true success. Nevertheless, the human race is a damsel in distress held steady by the\'freedom\'of the press. Once this is posted, I\'m sure they\'ll already have my a,\'ress.
I only have to be in a sunny beach side resort for a few days and I start to believe that I understand the local culture, respect the traditions and customs   8 days into a holiday and I\'m looking at property prices, wondering how I can give up the rat race to rent deck chairs out on the nearest beach   oblivious of course to any hi,\'en social, political or environmental considerations that disappear under the protected and surreal atmosphere of sunbathing, swimming, restaurants on the beach, and wearing shorts and open toe sandals.  So given this, I am normally very patient with this kind of conversation from ‘newbies\'. After meeting your 10,000th person who knows all about the country you live in you adopt a skill I refer to as \'hearing without listening\'. So I was surprised when something really upset me during the conversation I was having with this particular women. I wont embarrass her or me in releasing her name, but this was the anchor lady from a UK TV News program, a very famous, well educated, well dressed, well travelled, Porsche Driving (That may give the game away to people who know her) alpha female   the type that would eat you alive, and leave most men in a jelly like state after her whip lashing tongue had finished destroying any male ego you had the audacity to possess. She was like a Chinese Moon cake (I will explain in a later Blog) tempting and attractive on the outside, only to find a strong, spicy, and pungent filling on the inside.
I am honored to be here today and to have the opportunity to share this time with you. When Judge Mordue asked me to speak, I was delighted to accept. This venue combines two of my favorite groups; students and veterans. I am a history teacher at Cazenovia High School and truly believe helping and nurturing young scholars to be my reason for being. Young people like you are near and dear to my heart. With regard to veterans, I happen to be one, but that is secondary. For me, veterans are the embodiment of our nation\'s virtues. They are also living repositories of history. You\'re probably tired of hearing your teachers tell you that we need to learn from history, so let me phrase it differently   we can and should learn from those who have made history. Each year, I require my students to seek out and learn from veterans of our nation\'s wars. How blessed you are to have veterans in your own family   I hope you will never stop learning from them.
A word to the wise, if your look in for love and havint found it, the only advice I can give you lady\'s and guys is maybe you are look in all the wrong places. Maybe you need to just set back and enjoy life and they well come find you. trust me I have looked and looked and about the time I was about to give up and just set back and live life to the fullest she found me, I could be wrong but hey what\'s life you can\'t have someone to enjoy it with right. Keep your heads up and you well find that speacle someone!!!!
It\'s 2010, a whole new year full of possibilities has begun. For so many people, it\'s seen as a clean slate to mark a starting point. For others, a desperate hope for a terminus of a crap-filled past. For the rest, it\'s just a date on the calendar that reminds them to do something trivial yet important, like changing the batteries in their smoke detectors.  For me, I suppose it\'s all three.  First, I find the old soldiers, scattered around but within reach. In the glove box, in the travel case, in the overnight bag, in the dresser. It was time to say goodbye to my old pals, sad they couldn\'t see any action on the front lines, rotated out, having served their vigilant duty. It was time to bring in the new recruits. Then off to the local recruitment office (AKA Abu\'s Gas-n-Sip) to find the replacements.  I stood there surveying the troops at Abu\'s. Twisted Pleasure, Her Pleasure, Shared Pleasure, Intense Ribbed... they\'ve all had their time on the front lines. Magnum XL? I knew there was a Magnum, but an XL??? Damn, I feel sorry for that guy. I finally settle on the 3-pack\'Ultra Thin\'variety. Good, I could never feel anything with these before, maybe this version will make me feel like I\'m actually a part of the process for once. Only a 3-pack because I\'ve thrown more away for being too old and unreliable than I\'ve made use of in my life. Plus, I was a bit jaded after tossing out 2 unopened family packs the day before.  Which really brings up the question: Big boxes of twelve are called\'Family Packs\'. Isn\'t that a bit counter-intuitive, considering their intended function? Maybe that\'s what my subconscious was thinking at the time I bought the last few boxes. If I get a Family Pack, I can make a family. Huh.  So anyway, I got the ultra-thin... Not because it was Ultra-Thin (although that might be a bonus) but because it was the box with the furthest-off expiration date: 06-2014. Maybe if the stars align just right, this box will be opened before then.  Oh, I bought a Mega-Millions lottery ticket too while I was at the Gas-n-Sip. I figured I\'d have better chances with that than with my other purchase.  Come on, 32!!! Win for me, Sweetheart!
Life sucks!  I hate it. Not even a new camera makes it any better.  I know now that my whole life has been a fucking waste.  I have accomplished nothing.   I\'m an unemployed looser that has made nothing for himself.  Life is nothing more than a cruel joke.  HIV sure is taking it\'s sweet time with me and I don\'t expect the fucking heart attack to kick in fast enough.  Only death will be the cure for this incurable infection.   I am sure I lost a lot of friends over this and well, sorry to say but I honestly don\'t care.  For most of you I\'m just another coin in your collection and not one of the more valuable ones either. If you want to delete me, you go right ahead. The last fucking thing I need right now is someone telling me I got so much to fucking live for.  I\'m sorry but you don\'t know me that well, I would actually prefer that you did delete me if this blog is too much of a downer for you.   There\'s nothing left to say.......
Every day or so I shall give insight upon what I Brandon Rogers am thinking. I will not as most state what I am doing or feeling but the thoughts and stories of my mind. All things may not be as they seem. I may stray from the truth and bring out my most creative muse to entertain you. If this however comes to be please be aware that i will eventually tell you.One hand shake is a simple greating. Two is still okay if they are at the begining and end of a meeting of some sort. Three is awkward but aceptable. My only issue is when people are so nervus that they keep shakeing your hand throught out the meeting or what not. I have no problem with shakeing someones hand but I have noticed something o,\'. Most of my friends are female and most of there boy friends when they meet me they get nervous and so on to actualy shaking hands seven or eight times with me. Are they looking for my approval? Are they treating me like there only chance to get layed? Just an o,\' thing in life that I noticed. ohh well.
1. Avoid them, or 2. Do the harder thing (Which, in my opinion is always the best), and empathize with them and their issue.  You can\'t change anyone, but I think if you empathize, that builds trust, and you could possibly have the opportunity to offer some steps to correct the looping path away from the issue. I\'m not a professional counselor (I\'m think you might not be either), but caring for someone and their issue can open up your heart and mind to offer caring advice from time to time. Love and empathy can help you help others.  All this is hard. Life itself is hard, but sometimes the hardest lessons are the most rewarding.  Practice empathy. Do your best to set aside the instant platitude, listen and be empathetic.  The world is full of people going through difficult times, and if you take some times to start to practice empathy, you could have the opportunity to release the pain of one person, and that could have a positive ripple effect.  I\'ll leave you with this. This has happened to me. Sometimes the people that you help with empathy, can turn around and help you in a future time. We are not on this planet to be on our own, we need each other.  Have a great week. Another little distraction coming next Monday. Tell a friend. :)
Every piece of advice a father can impart on his son can make all the difference in the world.       Sometimes it doesn\'t even involve words       My father came from a family where the word \'love\' was scarcely shared. My dad was never the one for words. He always worked long hours or terrible shifts as a coal miner in West Virginia when I was young. When the coal mines shutdown, we moved to Florida where the cost of living was higher and the wages lower. My dad worked that\'s what he did.
In his book In Search of the Ivory-billed Woodpecker, Jerome A. Jackson relates that a fossil species was described as Campephilus dalquesti by Pierce Brodkorb, an American ornithologist and paleontologist.  This fossil species was discovered in Scurry County in central Texas, and dated to the late Pliocene epoch.  I wonder what C. dalquesti looked like.   Maybe a bit like this dino-bird!?  At least the colors look right. The dino-bird portrayed below is Anchiornis huxleyi - you can find more info here.   Check out this amazing video on finding dino color in fossil feathers.
He cannot speak English, and makes no bones about it. Can we talk in Hindi?, he asks coolly as we settle down with meethi chai in an air-conditioned hostel room, which he shares with fellow boxers Vijay and Ram Singh at Patiala\'s National Sports Institute. Why stay in a hostel, now? \'As a child I shared a room with my brother and five cousins. We were seven in a tiny room, and now we are just three!\' Uncluttered and uncomplicated. Maybe, that\'s what makes him a darling of the press. Or is it his rakish, rugged charm? \'don\'t know. People say I am more popular than Abhinav Bindra. It\'s destiny that I was born into a humble bus driver\'s family. Had I been pampered with trainers and dieticians, I wouldn\'t be what I am today. I am an athlete of the soil, fed on a solid diet of bajre ki roti and bhains ka doodh . \' Vijender\'s roots are rock solid.  His father still works for Haryana Roadways as a bus driver. \'I\'ve told him to take it easy, now that we have the money. But he says the day he stops working he\'ll stop living. I remember when my father used to farm a small piece of land. I helped him by watering the crops. Those were memorable days. Tilling the soil with bare hands is joy in its purest form. I think that\'s why farmers have a quiet dignity about them. \' This boy from a nondescript UP village called Kaluwas, along the Meham-Bhiwani road, hadn\'t seen much of life or money till destiny catapulted him to overnight stardom. Today, his days are full. He jet-sets to Delhi and Mumbai every week for photo ops, endorsement deals and P3 parties, where he rubs shoulders with Bollywood stars and society babes. This six-feet-tall charmer has also walked the ramp for Rohit Bal.
My name is Ryan. I like snowboarding, hiking, hunting, fishing... well anything that is outdoors. I am pretty straight forward. If i am thinking something i am going to tell you. I joined the military back in march and currently doing job training for the next year. I love what my job is in the military. Thats all i can say about that. If there is anything else you want to know about me just ask. Who I\'d like to meet: I have all the people in my life now that i want. I just wish i could be closer to all of them.
I truly miss\'love\'.  Young love was a beautiful thing. It was the most comforting thing I have ever felt.  I was never the relationship type of guy. I didn\'t even romantically or sexually care for females. But, after experiencing so-calle,\'dlove\'. I don\'t want to be without it.  I do wish, that I had found love with someone smarter. Someone who had a brighter thought pattern. And what upsets me the most is that i had worked hard. But, it all went to waste. And now, I have to rebuild it with someone new someday. I have no patience for that. I just want to skip to a time when I have it next.  I don\'t want some gross ass bitch. I don\'t want some dumbass slutty-type little GIRL. I want a beautiful, intelligent, mellow, logical, selfless, understanding, ladie-like female. Someone who doesn\'t involve herself with a grimey crowed. And does not use drugs or alcohol. Someone, I can respect. Who stays covered up. And makes logical decisions and considers most to all factors in a situation. Someone who can appreciate all things and keep me happy as well as me keep her happy.  I am afraid that I will never find that. I hate that I WANT to find love again. But, the truth is, love is a wonderful thing. I don\'t know what else to say. I\'m sure that \'God\' has someone in mind for me. And has had someone in mind for me in a while. The only problem I have is that I have become very impatient and depressed. Time has become my enemy. And that is causing me issues. I have writer\'s block. Goodbye for now.
I was at the public library last Friday. I was working on a sermon. In a carrel across from me was a man with his back to me. I first noticed him because he was a LOUD typer. Every keystroke echoed through the library. I couldn\'t have been the only to notice. I tried my best to keep my mind on what I was doing but every once in a while his fingers would whirl across the keyboard and the noise would echo out. So, I would look over at him and then I noticed; he was surfing MySpace sites that had gay men in provocative poses and they were unclothed. To each his own. But, please, don\'t use a public computer for that! I suspect he was using the library computer because there would be no record of where he was or what he was looking at. Had he been surfing those sites at work he likely would have been looking at some disciplinary action. But, I didn\'t need to see that. Please don\'t use a public computer for that
Impurity is the only thing that is pure. The greater, richer and so called pure things are always vulnerable to impurity. But impurity in itself is the truest of the forms. Look at the world. The corrupt hearts are so strong. Least shaken and unchanged. So mighty powerful that the world used to be a better place once with only a handful of corrupt hearts. But those handful ones had the mighty power of impurity. They spread it like the plague. Look around you. What yo ve is the invincible disease. So much so that the God\'s heart is touched by it and its a never failing touch.
So when it comes to war, I\'m not sure how to define my stance. Overall, I\'m a pacifist and think war is always wrong. New rule: Mankind never gets to say it is divinely created, enlightened or intelligent while blowing the shit of another country.  But... I know fighting can be inevitable. Even the Tao Te Ching refers to defending oneself and, let me tell you, I embrace this philosophy as wholeheartedly as I do my pacifism. You take a swing at me buster, you best prepare for some knuckle sammies. Not very Christ-like I suppose but a) I\'m not a Christian and b) modern Christians rarely follow this admonition anyway.  Now, some will argue that war and defending oneself is much the same thing. They see war as a good thing, a thing to be practiced often. Peace is not an option; only killing and bloodshed. They revel in this power. These sorts of humans brag of\'military might\'and having\'the best trained, finest Army in the world\'just as Napoleon did or Caesar before him. They lust for fighting and dominance, dominance over the whole Earth. Does it truly make a difference if these mad men are Americans and not Germans? Since when is killing and destruction a virtue to anyone but the fabled denizens of Hell itself? War is a poisonous goo filling their hearts and thoughts with taking a hill or planning bombing raids never mind the collateral damage. That\'s what I just don\'t get or put my head around. How can one delight in the slaughter of war? But it is so. I see it daily. There are millions of my fellow Americans who see war as glorious and divinely sanctioned and are proud to send our soldiers into death, cheering along like Roman cheering gladiators into the colloseum arena.  War is not sport but it has been transformed into one in these modern times where we can watch the participants play on Youtube or CNN. It\'s like a live action video game except when our soldiers die they don\'t get to hit the reset button and try the level again.
So I\'m in the corner tavern the other day, listening to these two enlightened, albeit, not very educated, idiots debating the need for a national health-care program.    Why is it that every booze hound is an expert on political issues? I go to the bar to drink, not talk, and certainly not to debate current affairs!!! I think from now on, I\'ll just stay home and drink in the privacy of my own home.    I really hate people, especially idiots and morons.......and pretty much everyone else!!!!!!!!!!!    Assholes!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I\'m still writing with my lucky pen.  It\'s been broken in half for a long time now but the ink still makes words.  The words sometimes cheer or bring despair; sometimes the rant gets caught in my facial hair.  There\'re holes in my boots and there\'s holes in my life but that just lets out the shit.  I\'ve yet to see a wise man stand in my shoes, and see the light of day from my point of view, but perhaps I\'m just not wise or I\'ve soap in my eyes.  I try to keep away from the things I despise but they just follow my feet like I was so much fresh shit and they\'re so many flies.
Hello, NikonSniper followers. Well, my trip to the Los Angeles area is coming to a conclusion. That\'s right, dear ... I\'m coming home! One of the things I do for comfort when I am alone and away from my family for great lengths of time is to listen to sermons online. I know, I can almost hear you shouting\'BORING\'! OK, OK, some of you are about to quit NikonSniper for good! You\'ve heard enough. I have just proved to you that I am completely looney! Well, some of you know I was a bit of a creative kid. I was A.D.D. before being A.D.D. was cool! So I was, ... let\'s say, a bit of a handfull. For those of you who are new, here\'s a little Background to give you an idea of what kind of rodeo clown I was when I was a kid. Anyway, I tell you this so you don\'t go around thinking I have my head in the clouds with no clue of the real world. Anyway. I was raised in a Christian home. More than that, ... my father was the pastor of a large church that we attended (sometimes in handcuffs). Oh, please don\'t cast me as some kind of religious fanatic. In fact, truth is ... I don\'t believe in religion whatsoever. I believe in a person and YES I know Him. And that God-man is Jesus. Anyway, ... I don\'t want to scare you off ... because I DO completely respect your views. Here\'s what I wanted to say. I find that as I age (get more older and more wrinkled-er) I appreciate nature more. If you would have told me when I was 30 that I would enjoy photographing butterflies one day ... well, I woulda told you that you were a complete ding-dong (probably not those words though). I so often feel at peace when I am sitting on a bench watching God\'s wonders. Like seeing wild deer up close just staring at you, giving you a close look, like they were sent to you. Well, I recently watched a sermon about the Christian in nature that I enjoyed calle,\'dIs God Green?\'You can hit the link and watch it if you like. It\'s good! It is by one of my favorite speakers named John Ortberg from Menlo Park Presbyterian Church in Menlo Park, CA. He won\'t bore you! Go on, give it a listen ... I dare ya ... it\'s a risk free way to tell your mom that you went to church. Pastor Ortberg speaks on how we are to respect the world of the Creator.
Today I shot two portraits. Both left me frustrated, both were my own fault. I just couldn\'t get them to go right, I was taking too long then the people started getting impatient, in turn the impatience with myself grew and I am left with a handful of\'missing it\'photos and none that really get the job done. I have been exchanging emails with a student over the past few days regarding portraiture; and after today I feel a bit like a hypocrite. I shot this photo of the Cricket a few days ago and the entire shoot lasted about 7 seconds. I didn\'t really pose her, just told her to freeze while I grabbed my camera. There is a magic in some portraits that no matter how hard you try you just can\'t extract in other situations. What worked two days ago with little to no effort couldn\'t be replicated even with exponentially more time today. Weird.
Monetary values change as consciousness changes. Prosperity Consciousness is Higher Consciousness because it is an expansion of the projection of the individual mind unto infinity and that is the reason why Yogi Bhajan taught us for the first ten years about meditation and yoga to help us heal ourselves, physically and mentally and then he started teaching us prosperity consciousness because it becomes more obviously important for one to become prosperous materially as one progresses spiritually. Yogi Bhajan was such a master that he was able to teach us the importance of this. If you look at any other spiritual discipline, you may or may not find this. As spritually aware people who are also conscious of our physical health we must balance all aspects of life. that is what yoga means to find the balance in all things.
And as the rain fell brilliantly against my window on a Saturday afternoon I noticed a pattern within the glitter of the rain drops.  The pattern was of a face that I recognized as life and we stared at each other.  We wanted to see who would be the first to blink and neither of us wanted to be the first one to give in.  What I noticed in life\'s eyes were my many sacrifices as I have had to hurdle the jump ropes of reality in order to live dreams without having to close my eyes.  And in this life, my life, I have suffered to be able to smile; I have cried to be able to enjoy my fate.  Acceptance is our greatest sacrifice I\'ve come to learn because until we accept our challenges we aren\'t able to come up with a game plan to reach our goals or to stimulate our own identity.
That\'s the second book in Timothy Zahn\'s trilogy. I bet y\'all thought that I\'d forgotten about you concerning our fun trips. I realize that it\'s been a while since our vacation, but I might as well post the pictures that I was planning. The delay has been caused by our Village Missions conference and my presence here at Zachary and Brenda\'s house. Hopefully I\'ll be able to post some pictures of this fun soonish, but until then, without further ado, the unveiling of our Seaworld pictures. I\'m a big fan of the Orcas. They are much more majestic than their cousins: regulation orcs. I was pretty sure, beforehand, that whaling was illegal in most states these days, but I certainly enjoyed my portion. There\'s a likelihood that I was a bigger fan of the Belugas than of anything else. For whatever reason, the all-white whales (or the all-black Pilot Whales which I have no pictures of) just greatly entertain me. Perchance my monochromatic preferences reflect my worldview? Here\'s a good pic of Emily and her Grandma looking at said whales.
There are two types of fall guys; one who willingly accepts responsibility for something he didn\'t do, to cover for those that did. And then, there\'s the other, who gets blame for it, because the one who actually did it, doesn\'t want to be held responsible for it. Either way, someone at the end is left holding the bag while the bad guy gets away.  Truth of the matter is, fall guys can be found in all walks of life. In the corporate world, in the politics of Washington, in the world of espionage, love triangles and even mostly in the world of organized crime.  Sometimes fall guys are not just about one, but about many. That\'s because in this so-called fault game, the notion becomes many and the more the many, the more confusing. The more confusing, the more difficult it becomes to find the truth. Who to blame and who to be held accounted for.   We live in a world of good versus evil. The fall guy is made out to be evil. When reality tell us that evil doesn\'t really exist. Because good prevails all and evil is simply a lack of. Evil becomes our creation. And in the end, its really all about us. Since we are to blame for its existence.  So in the end there is and always will be a fall guy. When the finger is pointed at who? It should always be pointed at us.
Alone for so long walking down the path of darkness with a lamp to guide my journey of life, the fates gust by the light goes out and I stand alone in the darkness wondering why.I continue to walk down the path not seeing anything but shadows and figures that speak of evil of man.  I pray and hope for an angel to walk with me as a guide and friend, soon in the midst of the darkness a glow begins, a path is laid before me showing me a place to call home. As I walk down this path I come upon a woman with a bright smile that let\'s my heart know all will be good. at first she was a stranger who offered nothing but kindness and love.  My angel shares her heart and pain with me as we walk beside each other on this path. I never knew of such kindness and love, a mother\'s love I never known the scars and fears that led to the dark path I took. Slowly the angel became my best friend and mother. Thankful for the blessings and kindness she gave to me. Through are pains together she has loved and stood by me, its fate that the woman who lost her son found one and the son who never had a mother found his. The path is brighter and easier now that my mother angel is with me .I has found peace in my life through the love and friendship of another who was hurt and lost likes I. My mother angel is my guardian, my keeper, my mother and best friend. I thank god for the blessings I have in this path I take. My biggest blessing is the mother I\'ve found to me that\'s the greatest gift of all.
It was a scavenger style race with checkpoints throughout Boston and the surrounding neighborhoods. At each checkpoint you would be given a task to perform\'find 5 pounds of stuff, carry it to the finish,\'find 10 pounds of stuff,\'find something that cant fit into this envelope\'etc etc. The idea was that by the end of the race we and our bikes would be covered in random objects and whoever had the most interesting stuff and the MOST stuff by the end of the race would win a prize. In the end, I finished the race 7/52 racers in about 3 hours with 40lbs of crap on me--which turned out to be good but not nearly enough to beat the eventual winner, Joshua, with an amazing 100lbs of junk hauled in on his cargo bike. The race was followed with a BBQ and bike games, all in all a very fun time that I hope to repeat again in a few weeks at the next race!
At the height of laughter, the universe is flung into a kaleidoscope of new possibilities. ~Jean Houston  When people are laughing, they\'re generally not killing each other. ~Alan Alda  I am creating this blog in pursuit to put more laughter in the world. Not only will I post my own original parodies, but I will also introduce you to other parody creators. I will introduce you to parodies in all forms—songs, video clips, stories, and books. Stick around and I promise you\'ll get a good laugh.  Mostly, I will be posting parodies that I made up in this blog. From time to time, I may review other parodies, parody writers, videos making fun of others, etc. Before I post a parody, I will first explain how the parody came to me. Often, it takes some time to explain, but it\'s sometimes interesting to hear how my imagination works. Also, I know that if you have to explain the meanings of \'jokes\' and what not, that means that they aren\'t funny. But there will be sometimes that I will want to explain certain parts of my parodies; a phrase, a verse or two.
I like birds, especially woodpeckers and MOST especially the huge Campephilus woodpeckers.  Four years ago I started a photo group on Flickr called Ivory-billed Woodpeckers and Others in the Campephilus Genus by posting a few photos that I took of a Pale-billed Woodpecker in Belize.   The illustrious Ivory-billed Woodpecker is a member of the genus.  There are many others too, with far smaller claims to fame, with words like Cream-backed, Crimson-crested, Magellanic, Powerful, and Robust in names that suit their unique brilliance.  Our group recently surpassed 1,000 photos contributed by many individuals - a real milestone!  Now this site becomes another way to celebrate these birds.
