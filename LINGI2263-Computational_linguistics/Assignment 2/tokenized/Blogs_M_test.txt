the many techniques and processes that are revolutionizing modern cooking </s> <s> Despite their growing popularity many remain confused about the difference between low-temperature cooking and sous-vide including equipment manufacturers </s> <s> Between the two low-temperature cooking is undoubtedly the more important </s> Low-Temperature Cooking Defined Cooking low temperature does not mean cooking food to a lower internal temperature than is traditional </s> <s> Low-temperature cooking refers to the temperature of the cooking medium not the final temperature of the food being cooked </s> <s> A rare steak has the same internal temperature whether cooked low-temperature or traditionally </s> <s> Low temperature cooking is defined as any cooking procedure where the cooking temperature is at or close to the desired final internal temperature </s> <s> There are two basic requirements for low-temperature cooking precise and accurate temperature control a cooking medium which conducts heat more efficiently and accurately than dry air </s> <s> Water and water vapor are typical but oil stock or any other liquid will work </s> <s> By way of example to cook a steak to an internal temperature of 55 C <math> F you could either sear it and put it in a <date> C <math> F finishing oven till it reaches 55 C <math> F not low temperature cooking or quickly sear it and throw it into an oil bath maintained at 55 C <math> F low temperature cooking but not sous-vide </s> In traditional high-temperature cooking the temperature of the cooking medium is almost never the same as the desired temperature of the food </s> <s> That is while your oven may be heated to <date> C <math> F your fry oil can to <date> C <math> F and poaching water to <date> C <math> F a steak cooked in those mediums can only be considered rare when it reaches an internal temperature of 54 C <math> F </s> <s> The difference between the desired final food temperature and the temperature of the cooking medium is referred to as temperature delta or T pronounced \'delta t \' the triangle is the Greek letter delta </s> <s> You should just get used to referring to <smiley> is like \'hey you want that squab cooked to 56 C Do you want to use a T \' Sous-Vide Defined In contrast the simplest way to define sous-vide may be to refer to its French meaning \'under vacuum \' Anything associated with a vacuum machine is sous-vide </s> <s> In restaurants the sous-vide process usually but not always consists of placing products into impervious plastic bags putting those bags under vacuum heat sealing those bags releasing the vacuum further manipulating processing or storing This is where it gets confusing sous-vide techniques are often used for low temperature cooking but not all sous-vide cooking is low-temperature cooking </s> <s> The classic example of this is boil-in-bag meals </s> <s> The cooking medium is boiling water not low temperature </s> <s> Yet because there is a vacuum process involved it is sous-vide </s> <s> That said sous-vide is very effective for low-temp cooking because food inside the bags neither dries out nor loses flavor during prolonged cooking if proper temperature is maintained </s> <s> The vacuum bags also eliminate evaporation and evaporative cooling </s> <s> The temperature of the food\ is surface becomes identical to the cooking temperature after a short time </s> Chefs and diners alike often confuse sous-vide and low-temperature cooking </s> <s> Sous-vide must involve a vacuum process but the food may be cooked at high or low temperatures </s> <s> About <math> of what cooks want to achieve with low temperature cooking can be achieved without a vacuum </s> II </s> <s> SOME USES AND ADVANTAGES OF LOW TEMPERATURE COOKING Uniform Cooking Increased Consistency and Shifting Control to the Chef Traditional steak vs </s> low-temp steak </s> <s> Traditional cooking typically uses a high T </s> <s> Foods cooked in this manner display an overcooked portion on the exterior </s> <s> Meat cooked at high temperatures does not have one level of doneness it is tasted as an average from the well-done exterior to the less cooked center </s> <s> Low-temperature cooking is less forgiving because there is no way to average out errors </s> <s> In a steak cooked at a low T the steak retains the same temperature throughout </s> <s> The difference of 2 C can make a large difference in texture when there is no averaging effect you need good temperature control The entire range of steak doneness from rare to well-done is only a matter of 14 C <math> F </s> <s> Luckily modern equipment easily gives us temperature control accurate down to a tenth of a degree which means we can cook products extremely uniformly and get them right <date> of the time </s> Uniformity can be a disadvantage no one wants a giant piece of roast beef that is one color all the way across but most of the time uniformity is an advantage because it leads to increases consistency </s> <s> Your steaks will never be over or under always just right </s> <s> This advantage cannot be overstated and it applies to restaurants or home cooks </s> <s> A \'itionally because the hard work of reaching the correct internal temperature is being regulated by an accurate piece of equipment the responsibility for getting the product right is shifted away from the line cook towards the chef who is choosing the temperature and setting the machine </s> Shifting Work from Service to Prep or from Party to Prep at Home We can always make more prep time </s> <s> Service is what service is </s> <s> Any time we can shift work away from service towards prep we win </s> <s> Many low temp techniques require more prep time than their traditional counterparts but are blindingly fast to finish off at service time </s> <s> The high speed finish derives from the fact that the food is pre-cooked and can be held warm and ready to go only needing a few seconds of finishing time </s> <s> Speed finishing is a boon to the home cook as well </s> <s> Parties are a lot more fun when you can hang out with your guests and all your food is in perfect finish at the same time </s> Low-Temp for Insurance Low-temp cooking can provide a type of cooking insurance by guaranteeing a minimum doneness </s> <s> Here\ is how 1 </s> <s> Low temp your food to the rarest you want it </s> <s> The food is now uniformly rare </s> 2 </s> <s> Cool the product completely </s> 3 </s> <s> Cook the product traditionally but focus only on obtaining the perfect exterior because the mi \'le is already cooked </s> <s> You have insured that the inside is done </s> <s> Here are some examples of low-temp for insurance Roasts can be challenging </s> <s> Often you get a good crust before the mi \'le is done and then overcook the whole piece to bring up the center </s> <s> Other times you focus on getting the mi \'le perfect but end up with a poor crust </s> <s> Low-temp insurance fixes that </s> <s> Low temp the roast till it is rare and cool it down </s> <s> Put the roast in a high oven and pull it when the crust is perfect you have already insured that the mi \'le is done </s> <s> On a beef Wellington it is very difficult to insure that the puff pastry and the beef come out nicely at the same time </s> <s> Usually the meat is overcooked or the pastry is too blond </s> <s> With low-temp insurance you sear and pre-cook and cool your tenderloin and then wrap it in puff pastry </s> <s> Now you can turn your oven up and just focus on getting the pastry nice and brown since your meat is already cooked </s> <s> Sausages are often poached before being finished in a pan on the grill </s> <s> This is high-temp cooking insurance </s> <s> Instead low temp-cook the sausages <math> C is usually good then finish them on a grill or in the pan </s> <s> The low-temp pre-cook doesn\'t overcook the meat and rely on fat alone to provide juiciness </s> <s> Duck breast is best cooked with low-temp insurance </s> <s> Pre-cook the breast to 57 C and cool it down </s> <s> Then just focus on crispy skin </s> <s> Low-temp for insurance tends to produce items that have textures and appearances very close to traditionally cooked items just better and more consistent </s> <s> Because the products have a traditional feel many cooks like this technique </s> Low-Temp for New and Novel Textures Low-temperature cooking also allows for the production of some textures that were traditionally unattainable </s> <s> Three examples Super-low temp fish Fish heated at extremely low temperatures around 50 C or <math> F to an internal temperature of 42 C <math> F has a dense fudge-like or custard quality unattainable with high T cooking </s> <s> This type of cooking is controversial many chefs dislike the texture attained with these methods and some scientists believe the techniques are unsafe </s> <s> Other chefs believe that the traditional cooking method overcooks fish and that the low-temperature method is best </s> <s> Low temperature braises In a typical braise meat with a lot of connective tissue is cooked at a high temperature for several hours </s> <s> The high temperature and several hours is what is needed to break down the collagen into gelatin </s> <s> This process overcooks the muscle and dries it out </s> <s> Luckily the gelatin re-moistens the overcooked meat and produces a delicious braise </s> <s> When a meat is under-braised it seems tough and dry because the collagen hasn\'t melted into juicy water holding gelatin </s> <s> With low temperature cooking however we can hold a tough piece of meat at a very precise temperature for a very long time </s> <s> If a short rib is held at 6o C <math> F it will maintain a lightly pink medium-cooked color for days </s> <s> The texture of the muscle fiber itself will also remain somewhat static </s> <s> The connective tissue on the other hand won\'t break down over the course of 3 or 4 hours at this temperature you need to cook it for two full days </s> <s> At the end of these two days however you will have a completely pink completely tender short rib that is a dream to slice and portion </s> <s> Creamy egg yolks When you heat a whole in-shell egg in water to 63 C <math> F the yolk becomes creamy not runny not set </s> <s> One degree lower is a runny yolk </s> <s> One degree higher is a set yolk </s> <s> The 63 C egg is a delight and completely impossible to make traditionally </s> <s> More on eggs later </s> <s> Low-Temp for Increased Tenderness Low-temperature cooking can also produce meats that are more tender than normal </s> <s> Enzymes responsible for some of the benefits of dry-aging meat increase activity as the temperature rises </s> <s> These enzymes are most active right before they denature between 49 C and <date> C <math> F and <date> F </s> <s> Because low-temperature cooking allows meat to stay in this zone longer than traditional cooking meat is more tender than normal </s> <s> Traditionally a large piece of meat heated for a long period of time such as a roast remains tender </s> <s> Low-temperature cooking makes it possible for smaller pieces of meat to be held at these low temperatures for longer periods of time </s> <repeatedchars> </s> <s> LOW TEMPERATURE COOKING DISADVANTAGES Surface Browning the Maillard Reaction and the Challenges of Low-Temperature Cooking Low-temperature cooking does not produce crisp flavorful brown exteriors which are usually obtained by cooking at high temperatures </s> <s> Much of the artistry of low-temp cooking involves getting around this limitation </s> <s> Some techniques include Using meaty savory flavors like soy sauce and miso both are high in umami </s> <s> Quick-searing meats for flavor either before they are cooked right before they are served or both </s> <s> Quick-searing in low-temperature cooking is performed at a higher than normal temperature to develop a brown crust without overcooking the interior of the meat </s> <s> Browning bones fat inexpensive pieces of meat or vegetables and putting them into the vacuum bag along with the main food before cooking </s> <s> The savory notes of the a \'ed pieces permeate the food over time </s> <s> Roasted fat is especially useful as many of the characteristic flavors of different meats are generated by the taste of cooked and broken down fats </s> <s> Uniformity of Texture The biggest gripe people have with low-temp cooking is that the uniformity of texture </s> <s> Some people say that all low temp food is \ amushy \' While it is true that bad-low temp food is mushy good low-temp food doesn\'t have to be </s> <s> One of the ways to guard against uniformity is to provide texture in the finishing step usually by searing </s> <s> A \'ing crunchy garnishes or cooking portions of the food separately to compensate for the lack of textural variety is another option </s> <s> A chicken breast cooked sous-vide for example might be served with a piece of crispy fried chicken skin although we have had good chicken this way we find the skin served this way not as satisfying as good-old crispy skin that is still stuck to the chicken </s> <s> Lastly European chefs often cook with a moderate T usually <date> C to \'overcook\' the outside of the food and provide some textural variation </s> <s> Most Americans don\'t cook this way because it require precise temperature measurement precise timing or both </s> <s> Most Americans cook with 0 T and a \' texture in the finishing step </s> IV </s> <s> WHY DO CHEFS USE SOUS-VIDE SOUS-VIDE FOR ECONOMY AND SOUS-VIDE FOR EFFECT Chefs may use sous-vide techniques and processes for a variety of reasons which roughly break down into two categories sous-vide for economy and sous-vide for effect </s> <s> The two approaches are not mutually exclusive therefore it\ is important to thoroughly understand both </s> Sous-Vide For Economy Storage Traditionally vacuum-packing has been used to enhance the storage life of cooked products </s> <s> The bacteria that cause food spoilage need oxygen to survive </s> <s> Since vacuum packaging removes all air and therefore oxygen from food spoilage is slowed drastically if the proper steps are taken </s> <s> Oxidation is also greatly reduced by utilizing vacuum-packing </s> <s> Foods like cut apples and artichokes do not turn brown quickly in vacuum pouches </s> <s> In long-term storage vacuum bags can prevent the oxygen-produced rancidity of unsaturated fats </s> <s> Low-moisture products like dehydrated fruit chips tend to stay crispy indefinitely in the low-moisture vacuum environment </s> Unfortunately some bacteria that cause illness pathogens are not inhibited by a lack of oxygen </s> <s> In fact some of the most dangerous bacteria thrive only in the absence of oxygen </s> <s> If sous-vide products are kept in unsafe conditions these pathogens can grow to dangerous levels without the simultaneous spoilage that would normally signal their presence </s> <s> This is why it is important to adhere to safety rules when using sous-vide </s> Organization Vacuum-packed pre-portioned foods are neat sanitary and easy to organize </s> <s> Many portions of the same product can be fabricated at the same time and then sealed which minimizes cross-contamination </s> <s> The food is handled minimally before being placed in a sterile environment </s> <s> Retrieving food is easy and each portion is individually protected from spills and other dangers such as a raw product dripping onto a cooked product </s> Sous-Vide for Effect Recently the unique properties of the sous-vide process have inspired a cooking movement that aims solely to increase the quality of food and achieve special culinary effects </s> <s> Think of this as sous-vide for effect </s> Texture Modification aka Compression The key to this technique is long vacuuming to get all the air out of the inside of the food </s> <s> After the food is sealed and the vacuum released there is an immediate observable change in the product as the voids that used to contain air are compressed </s> <s> On some products the effects of compression are accentuated over time pears become more translucent after several hours </s> <s> This process can be accelerated by re-vacuuming the sealed bag until the bag inflates with water vapor and then releasing the vacuum </s> Porous foods can have their texture and appearance radically modified by vacuum-packaging </s> <s> Watermelon for instance becomes denser changing from a mealy to a candy-like texture </s> <s> Pears cucumbers and tomatoes become translucent </s> Flash Pickling and Vacuum Marination Vacuum-packaging foods increases the uptake of flavorful liquids brines and colors </s> <s> The more porous the item the more dramatic the end results are </s> <s> For example a pear can be colored with port in an hour under vacuum </s> <s> Cucumbers and other vegetables can be flash pickled in seconds </s> <s> Meats can be brined in much less time than at atmospheric pressure </s> Forming The pressure exerted by the atmosphere can be used to form dishes </s> <s> Layers of food can be pressed extremely flat </s> <s> Once removed from the bag these compressed layers become easy to slice into beautiful portions </s> <s> Food can be arranged as in a terrine vacuumed solidified and sliced for decorative effects </s> <s> Some effects formerly achieved with a simple mold and a weight can be achieved more easily with a vacuum machine </s> De-airing When thick sauces and pures are blended they often have large amounts of air whipped into them </s> <s> Sometimes this air is undesirable </s> <s> When chefs use modern thickeners and gelling agents like xanthan gum trapped air becomes a problem as it affects the body of the sauce and its appearance liquids with many air bubbles appear white and opaque </s> <s> The thicker the sauce the more difficult it is to remove air </s> <s> Sauces that contain too much air can be made crystal clear by removing the air bubbles in a vacuum machine </s> Any liquid can have all their bubbles removed in a vacuum machine </s> <s> Place the liquid in an appropriately wide container not a bag inside the vacuum machine </s> <s> If there is too much liquid in the container the mixture will boil over and create a mess during the process </s> <s> Close the chamber and introduce a vacuum the liquid will start to rise and bubble </s> <s> Soon after the initial bubbles will break and the liquid will enter a rolling boil </s> <s> At this point the vacuum can be released and the liquid will have cleared </s> <s> This procedure is one scenario where there is no need to pre-chill the product being vacuumed because the desired outcome is to have the product boil </s> </s>

to 41 quarts </s> <s> Pressure canners are designed primarily to sterilize jars and cans for home canning not to cook in </s> <s> The standard pressure canner regulates pressure with an adjustible weight so once working pressure is reached it vents steam bad </s> <s> You can make the weight heavier and use the very nice and accurate gauge to regulate pressure up to about 18 or 19 psi without venting but to really go high-pressure you want a pressure sterilizer </s> <s> Pressure sterilizers are used by dentists and tattoo artists they are basically inexpensive autoclaves </s> Our WAFCO

they do it read on Before my wife and I started being nomads we weren\'t really budget people </s> <s> For instance my idea of a budget would be looking at my checking account to make sure that it was above 0 </s> <s> Money came in money went out </s> <s> I didn\'t really know where my money was going to half the time I just new that I was being paid twice a month and that covered just about everything </s> All of this changed though when we decided that we wanted to do extended world travel </s> <s> Obviously we would need the funds to start doing this so we started saving money to be able to travel the world </s> <s> And once we had this money saved we didn\'t want to go about blowing it on every thing that seemed like a good idea </s> <s> If we did that our trip would only last a few months </s> So we started being one of those people who keeps a meticulous budget </s> <s> You know the type </s> <s> We write down everything and then record it in a special budget spreadsheet complete with pie charts </s> <s> Even when we pay 10 cents to use the toilet in Ecuador we write it down </s> <s> We then play with the numbers to see how much money we have left and what we could possibly do with it </s> <s> Yes we play with spreadsheets for fun </s> The funny thing is that this is not a natural part of our personalities </s> <s> Truthfully I don\'t think we could have done this if it weren\'t for traveling </s> <s> One of the unexpected side effects of being on the road has been what we\'ve learned about our money </s> Comfort is not expensive We\'re not the kind of super cheap travelers who sleep in a cockroach-infested hotel </s> <s> Don\'t get me wrong we\'ve stayed in places that I wouldn\'t recommend to my parents but we try to sleep in places that at least try to appear nice </s> <s> What we\'ve found though is that a little extra money goes a long way </s> <s> For instance in Copacabana Bolivia we stayed in an immaculate room overlooking Lake Titicaca that we would normally find out of our price range </s> <s> To compensate for the extra cost while we were there we decided to spend less money on doing \'tourist\' activities such as tours and more time just walking around and getting to know the area </s> <s> As a result we felt like we got to know the town better and had a wonderful time in the process </s> <s> Of course it also doesn\'t hurt to wake up to the views of Lake Titicaca every morning </s> On the contrary we\'ve also stayed in name-brand plush hotels which cost about <math> times a decent mid-range option </s> <s> And what have we gotten for the extra price So far the only advantage that I can find for staying in plush hotels is that they give away better quality shampoo </s> Spending should match priorities Having a budget is all about making decisions </s> <s> With only a limited amount of money to spent we can\'t do everything we want to do all the time </s> <s> This makes us evaluate what our priorities are and spend our money according to these priorities </s> <s> One of our priorities while traveling is to understand different cultures and interact with people in those cultures </s> <s> So accordingly we try to spend our money on things that meet this priority instead of spending it on doing things like adventure activities like white water rafting </s> <s> We enjoy those activities as well but it doesn\'t

speaking Spanish have far outweighed any eye candy that we\'ve come across </s> A Little Dose of Perspective Helps If we\'ve learned nothing else from traveling it\ is a sense of perspective </s> <s> It\ is hard for us to justify buying anything expensive when we know that the average Nicaraguan family could live off of that money for months </s> <s> Just the fact that we can afford to even go to these places to see how other people live indicates that we\'re not exactly strapped for cash </s> So when we do buy things we try to buy them with our needs in mind </s> <s> In the Andes of Ecuador I

The selection of speakers was very diverse </s> I was concerned that the majority may involve a cheerleading squad for a particular view but in fact topics and speakers ranged from those who believed in an inevitable \'hard takeoff\' Singularity to those who though some singularity was necessary to avoid existential risks to AI researchers who believed that belief in the Singularity is just a cognitive bias that futurists have </s> Regardless of their views though every speaker treated the subject matter as a very serious and legitimate topic of discussion and investigation </s> - Ray Kurzweil\ is talks were very good as one might expect though I personally felt these were some of the less exciting parts of the summit </s> I don\'t think it\ is any fault of Kurzweil\ is though since I\ am just really familiar with his work and arguments and it seems like he\ is had to respond to the same tired arguments for several years now </s> Two things that impressed me were the astonishing amount of evidence detail and overall research he puts into his thesis far more thorough than any other speakers and second the fact that he really looks a lot younger than a man in his 60s </s> I know some folks take jabs at the astonishing amount of supplements and other dietary medical steps he takes to increase his lifespan but it really does seem to have an effect on his vitality and appearance </s> He could easily be a good front man for the movement though I noted that he wasn\'t presented as such and a variety of other speakers seemed to be pushed to the forefront instead </s> - Eliezer Yudkowsky as always was very clever and humorous in his examination of cognitive bias and how downright insane human beings are really wired to be </s> With a series of statistics with the audience participating in some questions he showed how even a \'rational\' person\ is mind can be hacked primarily due to its messy \ ispaghetti code\' evolutionary history </s> Symptoms of cognitive bias include tending to believe more specific or dramatic threats over more realistic ones examples included the Bush administration preparing for elaborate \ amovie threats\' while ignoring statistically more likely and dangerous threats like hurricane disasters </s> With relation to the Singularity one popular fear is the \'Terminator Scenario\' where AI becomes violent humanoid and bend on destroying the human race </s> Despite having not even the slightest grounds in fact this image is popular because it\ is specific and dramatic </s> Likewise in regards to futurism in general we tend to overestimate the macroscopic flying cars jet packs space travel and underestimate the advances of the subtle internet cloud computing augmented reality specific and general AI </s> Peter Thiel co-founder of <weirdcaps> and venture capitalist provided a very interesting perspective </s> From the view of a technologist and businessman he believes that the topic that needs to be discussed further is what happens if the Singularity doesn\'t happen or doesn\'t happen fast enough </s> He seems to be of the opinion that if it doesn\'t develop quickly enough there could be an incident similar to the dot com crash\' where investors overestimated tech growth only on a much larger more devastating scale </s> He argued that the Singularity has the potential to be an extremely beneficial trend in the future but there needs to be a more concentrated economic and industrial effort to ensure that it develops the right way and at the right pace </s> Aubrey de Grey may have been my favorite speaker as the topic of biological longevity research is an area where my education is sorely lacking </s> Some magnificent leaps and bounds in this field have been made and Dr </s> de Grey graphed life expectancy paths using only the most pessimistic predictions regarding advancements amongst different age groups today </s> It was a very thorough talk and while seemingly optimistic it involved some of the hardest tangible science out there </s> I feel this is one angle of Transhumanism that should get more face time in the public eye </s> While AI is the more significant thing to watch in the long run and the most terrifying aging and longevity research is a very tangible understandable science with a growing and continuous set of real-world applications that even the harshest cynic couldn\'t call useless </s> On top of that Dr </s> de Gray really does come off as a very charming thoughtful person who is genuinely interested in helping everyone he can at the expense of perhaps his own longevity </s> -Another interesting observation is that half the freaking people at the summit read Dresden Codak </s> <s> Why on Earth would such important individuals waste their time on this comic is beyond me but it was kind of neat </s> Even though I was just an attendee I\'ve never gotten this much attention even at a comic show on the second day I was even roped into giving autographs in the lobby </s> A definite highlight was when Aubrey de Grey pulled me aside to praise my satirical essay featuring Trans-Simianism </s> <s> Who knew Conclusion a wonderful group of intellectuals discussing a relevant and fascinating array of subjects from autonomous cars to brain scans to curing blindness to avoiding being destroyed by a superintelligence </s> Both the speakers and attendees are the type of people I wouldn\'t mind seeing again at next year\ is summit </s> If you\'re interested in the subject at all from skeptic to optimist and can afford the price of admission it\ is definitely an event worth seeing for yourself </s> -AD </s> </s>

of rain forest in this part of the world </s> <s> In the media this destruction has been linked to the rapid growth of the biodiesel industry - calling into question the very notion that biofuels will help our societies transition to a more environmentally responsible future </s> <s> As an advocate of a sustainable biodiesel I wanted to see and understand the impacts first-hand </s> <s> A few weeks before the winter holidays my wife and I discussed possible vacation destinations </s> <s> At one point we asked each other where it was that we most wanted to travel to regardless of the practicality </s> <s> Borneo came to mind and on a lark almost we looked into airfares and cost </s> <s> Surprisingly we found that if we flew on Christmas day we could get a really good airfare </s> <s> So with only 10 or 12 days to go we booked our flights and feverishly prepared to fly halfway around the world </s> <s> What we found was perhaps one of the most active frontiers between wilderness and traditional cultures and the modern industrial world </s> <s> As with so much of this tension much of this revolves around questions of energy so I wanted to write a bit in my blog about what we observed </s> <s> First allow me to situate Borneo in some context </s> <s> Borneo is the third largest island in the world larger than Texas and is shared not always peacefully but Malaysia Indonesia and Brunei </s> <s> We visited the Malaysian part of Borneo consisting of the states of Sabah and Sarawak running across the northwestern portion of the island with the exception of the Sultanate of Brunei which is a small and wealthy pocket between the two states </s> <s> The interior of Borneo is the very definition of rugged </s> <s> Never having been glaciated the landforms are quite dramatic </s> <s> The rain forest is home to many dangerous animals and even plants - including a tree who\ is sap can kill a man in minutes if it so much as touches a small open wound </s> <s> Just moving through the forest is exhausting - even on a trail </s> <s> The thin soil barely covers the uneven and razor-sharp limestone geology </s> <s> Even on flat ground the pockmarked terrain conspires with thick tree roots that criss-cross the ground to create a forest floor seemingly designed to trip and twist the ankle of the unwary </s> <s> The lowlands are largely submerged in a foot or two of tea-colored swamp and are home to several different flavors of leech which inevitably attach themselves to inconvenient areas of the body </s> <s> Massive walls of limestone rise at a punishing angles from the lowlands creating ridgelines that are extremely difficult to traverse </s> <s> A jungle trek in Borneo even today is an adventure </s> <s> This kept colonizers - first Indian Rajahs then the English\'white Rajas\'- marginalized in their real control of the territory to the coasts </s> <s> Many of the indigenous Dayak peoples that live in Borneo only had regular contact with the outside world primarily missionaries starting in the 50\ is </s> <s> Headhunting was a regular activity of these peoples up until World War Two at least with many invading Japanese soldiers losing their heads to traditional barefooted warriors armed only with machetes and blowpipes and it should be noted many groups were systematically slaughtered by the Japanese in retribution </s> <s> We met elders who had fought and taken heads as young men and had the tattoos to prove it </s> <s> Because Borneo is so rugged until recently all travel was on the river systems river travel is still by far the easiest way to get around and almost all of the peoples lived their lives on the rivers and forests immediately adjacent </s> <s> As could be expected the rain forest is a rather inhospitable place for outsiders wishing to exploit the resources </s> <s> In contrast for the indigenous peoples the forest is their traditional supermarket pharmacy hardware store and lumber yard </s> <s> Our guide of Iban extraction showed us dozens of unremarkable looking plants just off the trail each of which had numerous uses </s> <s> The semi-nomadic Dayak have lived in these forests for many centuries at least and their traditional culture is exquisitely intertwined with it </s> <s> Our guide lives in an apartment spends a lot of time of his cell phone promptly answers his email and flies between cities to meet his clients </s> <s> Yet as a youth he learned to make fifty different kinds of traps and to hunt with a blowpipe </s> <s> He estimates that he could survive for at least a month in jungle if he was dropped into it with nothing but the clothes on this back </s> <s> Nonetheless exploitation of the forests has proceeded apace since the <date> is or so beginning with logging of tropical hardwoods </s> <s> The lowlands have been drained to allow access for bulldozers lumber trucks and a massive amount of inexpensive labor largely Indonesian workers </s> <s> A lot of this logging is now on the third or fourth pass over the more accessible areas with smaller and smaller trees being taken out </s> <s> Now that the economically extractable timber is dwindling much land is being cleared outright primarily for palm oil plantations </s> <s> These plantations form the backbone of a tropical oleo-economy that may be as economically and ecologically significant as the corn and soy agricultural economy of North America </s> <s> Those of you that follow the debates over biofuels are no doubt familiar with palm oil </s> <s> This crop produces very high yields of oil from its fruits </s> <s> It is farmed as a monoculture with oil extracted using industrial-scale processes to yield a wide variety of products ranging from edible oils to chemical feedstocks </s> <s> What most people seem unaware of with all the hand-wringing about biofuels is that even without the influence of biodiesel the spread of oil palm plantations seems inevitable </s> <s> Palm oil is a crucial source of cheap calories throughout the tropical developing world </s> <s> Almost all fried food in Southeast Asia and India is cooked in palm oil and proprietors of roadside stands and small restaurants thrive or fail by the market price of this commodity </s> <s> The Malaysian Palm Oil Council indicates that <math> of palm oil is consumed as food with the remaining portion used in non-food applications including biodiesel </s> <s> This is worth repeating - at present less than <math> of the palm oil produced globally is used to make biodiesel </s> <s> The vast majority is consumed </s> <s> While we were in Borneo Malaysia was in a several day uproar over a rumor of palm oil rationing of course Malaysia is one of the largest producers of palm oil but the export market had apparently squeezed domestic supply </s> <s> Palm oil derived chemicals are found in many every day products like shampoo cosmetics and processed foods </s> <s> Palm oil has even been proposed as irony alert an\'environmentally sensitive\'drilling fluid for deep-sea petroleum exploration </s> <s> However that said the demand for high-yield oil crops to serve biodiesel demand - predominately from Europe - has lead to something of a gold rush mentality among palm oil plantation owners who are enthusiastically clearing land in preparation for exponentially increasing demand it takes nearly 3 years from the time a plantation is put in until the point the palms bear the oil-rich fruit </s> <s> The increasing demand for palm oil and lag time until the plantations bear inevitably leads to boom and bust cycles </s> <s> The current high price of palm oil fuels two contentious debates with regards to bio-based energy - global warming impact from forest clearing and the food vs </s> fuel controversy </s> <s> Recently the European Union proposed a sustainability certification scheme that would preclude the use of most palm-oil based biodiesel </s> <s> This seems prudent and wise but to date is only a proposal </s> <s> So now to the situation on the ground by air </s> <s> As I noted until recently the only practical way to get around Borneo was by river </s> <s> However this is no longer the case </s> <s> Malaysian Borneo is now served by an excellent and affordable network of airlines mostly flying Airbus A <date> is on longer routes to the bigger airports and twin-engine turboprops Twin Otters and Fokker 50\ is to the smaller destinations </s> <s> Our experience with air travel in Malaysia is that it matches or exceeds one\ is experience in the <smiley> both in terms of cost and comfort </s> <s> It is also an excellent opportunity to see the lay of the land </s> <s> In many places what you observe is oil palm plantations as far as the eye can see </s> <s> The vastness of this is hard to overstate </s> <s> One can see huge areas cleared to bare soil with neat grids of access roads ready to to be planted and similarly undulating rows of palms in various states of maturity often surrounding isolated islands of jungle atop inaccessible spires </s> <s> On the ground the experience is repeated </s> <s> Driving from the airport in Tawau to the dive spot gateway of Semporna about an hour away one sees virtually nothing but these plantations </s> <s> It is a sobering experience to think of the biodiversity that has been annihilated by these massive developments </s> <s> It is also difficult to overstate the impact on the Dayak both by the plantations and the logging </s> <s> Many Dayak have moved to the cities and live very modern lives and especially some Iban groups do enjoy political power and influence </s> <s> Thus there are certainly some cases where the indigenous groups have benefited economically - at least in the short term - by these activities </s> <s> By and large however the lions share of the economic benefit has gone directly to the largely Chinese companies which run the logging operations and plantations and indirectly to the mainland Malay who enable this exploitation from a political perspective </s> <s> Most of the labor as mentioned is imported from Indonesia </s> <s> We visited a longhouse as part of a backpacking trip in Mulu park </s> <s> This longhouse is a traditional structure where an entire village lives under one roof </s> <s> In practice this is essentially an enormous low-rise apartment building with a large common veranda in front </s> <s> The people of this longhouse still make much of their livelihood from the forest </s> <s> The tourists that visit come to see the protected areas of the national park that abut these communities even while some of the same people involved in the tourism trade illegally hunt wild boar inside the park boundaries as they have for hundreds of years </s> <s> One of the main cash trade activities is gathering wild fruit particularly durian from the jungle as wild-harvested durian is considered to be the best of this sought-after delicacy and commands a high price in urban markets </s> <s> The people who live in the longhouses still look to the forest in short for food medicine and building materials </s> <s> Thus many logging concessions have met with significant protest by the indigeous people including road blockades met with government violence </s> <s> We spoke to one park guide who had been active in such a movement in his home village who had been imprisoned and beaten </s> <s> In turn he and his compatriots fashioned handcuffs from sharp-edged jungle leaves and built a jail with walls of poisonous thorns and informed the police that unauthorized incursions on their territory from them or any loggers would be similarly met with imprisonment </s> <s> In the end such confrontation is only a delaying tactic and this guide recognized that the only way to preserve the forest is for the forest to produce economic activity for his village </s> <s> Otherwise there is temptation to fall prey to divide-and-conquer tactics on the part of the logging companies like substantial payoffs to prominent individuals to allow logging and plantations </s> <s> While one solution is official government protection of the lands Malaysia has at times resorted to fairly heavy-handed tactics in the establishment of these national parks </s> <s> For instance on the outskirts of Mulu park there is a Penan\ isettlement\'where the primary activity is sales of handicrafts trinkets really to tourists </s> <s> The Penan are not there by choice </s> <s> As a semi-nomadic people with a hunter-gatherer culture that has changed little since the Stone Age they were judged by the government to not be compatible with the establishment of a national park and were enticed or forced from their traditional lands about 15 years ago </s> <s> They were told to choose between being Muslim or Christian the government built homes a church they chose Christian mostly because being Muslim would preclude them from hunting forest game and a school and have tried to teach them to practice agriculture </s> <s> They were the most economically and culturally depressed people that we met in Borneo </s> <s> Without a doubt this sort of thing has lead to undeniable ethnic tensions in Borneo </s> <s> Malaysia advertises and prides itself on being a multi-ethnic and harmonious state but in practice relations seem strained at best </s> <s> We met a ethnic Chinese taxi driver who told us not to trust any ethic Malays as we would be ripped off Malays who were horrified that we would hire an ethnic Chinese taxi driver as we would be ripped off and indigenous people who had no love lost for either group or migrant Indonesian workers and were deeply concerned about ethnic tensions and resource exploitation exploding into outright sectarian violence as has occurred periodically in Indonesia </s> <s> The ironic thing of course is that we were treated fantastically by everyone we met of every ethnicity although of course as Americans traveling in a majority-Muslim country we were often offered direct opinions and confrontational questions about our government\ is foreign policies </s> <s> Even as the indigenous people fight to preserve and to have access to their traditional lands it should be recognized that the tide of modernization is not on the whole leaving them behind </s> <s> It was no coincidence that at the longhouse we saw few men of working age mostly old people children and some young women with families </s> <s> One of the activities we participated in the longhouse was a presentation and participation in traditional music and dancing </s> <s> During this one of the few young indigenous men around was taking pictures of the dancing with his digital camera - he was clearly home on a break </s> <s> We met a large number of youngsters that spoke flawless English and were getting ready for their big exams to get into secondary school and then they hoped into university </s> <s> The interior of the apartments we saw were heavy with photos of graduates in caps and gowns the resident\ is children and grandchildren </s> <s> The longhouse itself - though poor by first world standards - had electricity indoor plumbing refrigeration and satellite <smiley> in many apartments </s> <s> The level of material wealth present - compared for instance to rural Africa - was very high </s> <s> That Malaysia - even in these outlying areas - is not a poor country comes back to the theme of this blog once again </s> <s> The petroleum industry in Malaysia is the engine </s> <s> The Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpar are one of the most impressive man-made sights I have ever seen in my life </s> <s> These edifices were not built on palm oil profits obviously </s> <s> Malaysia\ is\'asian tiger\ istatus is largely a function of oil wealth </s> <s> Their policies are leading to significant investment in education for its citizens and economic diversification towards the semiconductor industry for instance which is wise </s> <s> However there is a clear sense of striving towards ever increasing material wealth that is already dramatically impacting the preservation of cultural diversity as Malaysians of all ethnicities embrace a homogenized cultural mieleu seemingly centered on American pop music Japanese fashion and the most impressive shopping malls one could imagine </s> <s> It seemed to me that perhaps the most popular recreational activity for young Malaysians of any ethnicity is to spend the day packed like sardines into a\'cybercafe\'where they play games Counterstrike Grand Theft Auto and World of Warcraft seemed popular IM and watch <weirdcaps> </s> <s> At about 1 per hour to enjoy air-con entertainment and socializing it is indeed a good value </s> <s> It is frankly an open question whether the rain forest of Borneo can be meaningfully preserved in the face of this dynamic </s> <s> Hand in hand with this preservation of traditional cultural knowledge is in question of course the Dayak of Borneo have and will continue to adapt their cultural response to circumstances </s> <s> It is likely as in other circumstances that the young Dayak will realize that their cultural heritage is fading and will work to reconstitute their traditions and identities </s> <s> Still inevitably much will be lost - especially if the forest is destroyed </s> <s> Again from the perspective of this blog the question is whether renewable energy is working as a constructive and destructive force </s> <s> For the Dayak that have installed micro-hydro run of river systems and now enjoy electrification this serves to strengthen their local economy and this in turn helps them preserve the forest </s> <s> Conversely if the West sources it\ is biofuel feedstock from palm oil Borneo\ is transformation may be irreversible and complete </s> <s> In this case the fate of the Dayak may follow that of other indigenous groups who\ is values lifestyle and location are not compatible with massive resource exploitation </s> <s> Let us hope that this does not come to pass </s> <s> As a closing note I can recommend The Borneo Project as a group that is doing great to help the various groups in Borneo achieve sustainable economic activity and thereby preserve the rain forest </s> <s> Please donate link at top </s> <s> Yesterday the Berkeley City Council unanimously approved an ordinance that will finance <smiley> systems and energy efficiency improvements for homeowners in the city </s> <s> Though the plan was announced last week I haven\'t had a chance to blog so this is as good a time as ever to write a few words about it </s> <s> When I first heard of this it struck me as one of those\'only in Berkeley\'type things and rubbed my libertarian streak the wrong way leading to ornery thoughts </s> <s> It\ is been a long time coming right How come the private sector can\'t get it together to provide financing for residential <smiley> It has always seemed like a fantastic opportunity for an entrepreneurial approach so it seems like Berkeley is competing directly with private enterprise here </s> <s> But can you usurp private enterprise if the service isn\'t really being offered by the private sector I guess not </s> <s> I\'ve come around </s> <s> The way this is structured is actually brilliant and everyone wins </s> <s> So in a nutshell the deal is that the City pays the upfront cost for the installed system </s> <s> Then an assessment is a \'ed to the property tax and through this assessment the homeowner pays the City back with interest over 20 years </s> <s> So here are the main points First assuming the system is sized properly the assessment is less than the utility savings so it is cash-flow positive for the homeowner and of course after 20 years it\ is free power </s> <s> Second the system and the assessment belong to the property not to the homeowner </s> <s> This is critical </s> <s> It means that value of the system will be properly appraised as part of the property so there is no risk of losing the value of the system upon sale of the house </s> <s> Moreover whether an owner stays in the house for 1 year or 30 years they still see all upside </s> <s> Third the City is raising the money with a municipal bond the lowest interest rate anywhere passing this through to the homeowner helps make the economics compelling </s> <s> Fourth the City gets a guaranteed revenue stream </s> <s> The biggest issue that I see is that demand in Berkeley is going to utterly explode </s> <s> I have a hard time imagining that nearly every homeowner in Berkeley who gets wind of this won\'t try to sign up </s> <s> I don\'t know how any of the local installers will keep up in the short term at least </s> <s> This sounds like a nice problem to have but of course the concern is that there could be a proliferation of naive and in all probability like in any\'gold rush\' some opportunistic new installers and service providers doing this work -- and doing a bad job </s> <s> Of course most new entrants will be honest and competent but it\ is the inevitable bad apples that worry me </s> <s> Balancing exceptional industry growth and the need for installers to support that growth are the realities that properly installing <math> year service life equipment is not easy there is a rather complex set of reliability safety and regulatory rebate issues to grapple with and customers who may not have realistic expectations due to relentless solar hype are not necessarily the easiest to please </s> <s> The other substantive concern I have is if the contract with the City and thus the assessment includes periodic inverter replacements or whether the homeowner is on the hook for it on their own </s> <s> Modules are typically guaranteed to product at least <math> of their rated power after 25 years but most inverters carry a 10 year warranty </s> <s> This means it is very likely that at least one inverter replacement at the owner\ is cost over the system lifetime and possibly two will be required </s> <s> At a couple thousand bucks a pop depending on size this has implications for system economics </s> <s> An honest and professional assessment of system economics should assume these maintenance costs as well as the slow degradation in power output </s> <s> The inverter issue is quite problematic if a new owner moves in just before the inverter fails out of warranty and then has to either shell out cash for the equipment pay the assessment even though they are getting no benefit or try to get the property assessment canceled in which case the city is left holding the bag </s> <s> The city says it will roll out the plan in about 8 months so hopefully will have the foresight to a \'ress this issue </s> <s> All that said assuming this doesn\'t get bungled up in red tape or political shenanigans -- and there\ is never a guarantee there especially in B-town -- it seems inevitable that this idea will spread quickly </s> <s> One of the most interesting aspects of solar these days is the leadership of the states in successfully setting de facto national energy policy in the current leadership vacuum at the Federal level </s> <s> It appears that Berkeley has taken this one step further </s> <s> Potentially this initiative could serve as a seed crystal for a concept that could radically impact the way we produce electricity nationally even internationally - one town at a time </s> <s> There is an excellent article on biofuels in the October National Geographic </s> <s> It does the best job I\'ve seen in any mainstream publication - perhaps in any publication - of elucidating the importance of feedstocks to the sustainability and ultimately feasibility of biofuels </s> <s> The article touches on both ethanol and biodiesel </s> <s> With ethanol the article focuses on corn sugarcane and the Brazilian experience and celluosic feedstocks and the tradeoffs of each </s> <s> For biodiesel soy is discussed but algae also gets significant attention including a rare behind-the-fence photo at the Greenfuels plant in Arizona </s> <s> I highly recommend picking it up for a read </s> <s> It also includes a fascinating article about modern pirates in Southeast Asia </s> <s> So you really can\'t go wrong </s> <s> In other news Solar Power <date> was great last week </s> <s> It was fun to see old friends and colleagues and there was a fantastic sense of momentum </s> <s> My presentation on innovation drivers for balance of system components seemed a success with some good questions so that was very satisfying </s> <s> I only made a couple of the other talks the CEO forum and the closing plenary </s> <s> The forum was quite interesting with some good questions and it seemed frank answers </s> <s> Main fact - national SEIA had a lobbying budget of just 20 <date> last year and the goal this year is just 60 <date>

by the senior energy manager of Wal-Mart </s> <s> I was not aware that they are far ahead of the pack in terms of energy efficiency in their stores though of course I had heard of the solar roll-out </s> <s> Apparently this is just a pilot and if successful Wal-Mart has a policy and track record of rolling out energy innovations massively </s> <s> That is truly exciting stuff </s> <s> I\'ve been thinking about this next post for a bit now </s> <s> I haven\'t had time to write anything lately but hopefully I\'ll be able to post somewhat consistently over the next few months </s> <s> What\ is on my mind is giving some advice to the those that seek a job in the solar industry </s> <s> There are lots of opportunities out there for the right people and it\ is a good time to get your foot in the door </s> <s> At the same time as has been noted before the hype machine is in overdrive </s> <s> So buyer beware especially if your livelihood is riding on it </s> <s> So let me first start with a cautionary tale </s> <s> On Friday the entire board of directors and CEO of Automatic Tooling Systems ATS the Canadian company that owned Spheral Solar and conventional module manufacturer <weirdcaps> resigned in the face of\'dissident hedge fund\ ishareholders demanding a turnaround </s> <s> ATS\ is foray into renewable energy as well as auto industry woes was blamed for this sory state of affairs </s> <s> Spheral Solar was actually shut down earier this year and ATS tried to spin off <weirdcaps> in an IPO in late March but failed </s> <s> Previously Spheral was touted as the best thing since sliced bread an amazing technology that allowed them to make flexible modules with significantly less silicon that in theory at least boasted near crystalline <smiley> efficiency </s> <s> Four years ago the\'New Scientist\'wrote this breathless article about\'demin\' solar panels to clothe future buildings\' and Future Pundit wrote that Spheral would\ istart production in <date> 'Yet as late as January <date> the\'Clean Break\'blog opined referring to a deal between building products manufacturer Elk recently acquired by GAF and Spheral to make building-integrated roofing materials with the technlogy that\'the product is sold before it\ is even been produced </s> <s> Now that\ is the kind of certainty that investors like\' </s> <s> Well maybe so but of course that only works out if the company manages to manufacture their technology on a commercial scale </s> <s> If you\'ve been following the solar industry for any length of time you come to realize that announcements from a company of the intent to produce or the ability to produce or even signed contracts to manufacture and install their technologies means very little if they don\'t have a track record of doing so especially if they announced and then failed to go into production two years prior </s> <s> The point of this cautionary tale is that there are a lot of solar companies out there these days and there are all sots of announcements and blog posts and what-have-you that make them look like just the greatest new thing </s> <s> Be skeptical and be smart because in the next 5 years or so I think we\'re going to see a significant shake-out occur in this business </s> <s> If you are looking for a job gut-check the risk level you are willing to take </s> <s> If there are only a few employees promises of lots of options some venture funding and a prototype out in a garage - well that\ is a high risk situation </s> <s> Potentially high reward if it actually does work out of course </s> <s> But a day of reckoning will come for all start-ups especially if VC funded </s> <s> There are a number of well known seemingly reputable companies that have been around for years now and have yet to set up even modest manufacturing capacity or field a market-ready i e </s> all required certifications product </s> <s> There\ is even one which shall remain unnamed based in Silicon Valley which is infamous for being extraordinarily well funded - yet no one I\'ve spoken to has even seen a prototype of their breakthrough technology </s> <s> That\ is all well and good for a while but after several years have passed one must begin to wonder </s> <s> Conversely there are more established players with a reputation products vision and great growth potential but less speculative upside </s> <s> Look at the bigger pattern the fundamentals if you will </s> <s> There\ is nothing new under the sun ahem </s> <s> Thin film was the the Next Big Thing five or six years ago unfortunately there were some serious reliability issues and so much for that </s> <s> Now it\ is back in vogue </s> <s> Not coincidentally this new generation of thin film technologies most of which is not yet commercialized arose simultaneously with a rather prolonged shortage of polysilicon the raw material of relatively high-efficiency crystalline solar cells </s> <s> Same with concentrating photovoltaics which saw a lot of effort in the \'80s and up until the mid \'90s then largely abandoned as the price of 1-sun cells came down but resurged with poly shortage driving silicon prices up </s> <s> The high prices made thin film and CPV look good - trading significantly less silicon usage for low efficiency and mechanical optical complexity respectively </s> <s> So now it\ is two or three years later </s> <s> Some of these new innovators have already fallen by the wayside others are still working towards commercialization and one German thin film company made it past the finish line in time and is raking it in and good for them </s> <s> But it seems that in the opinion of most analysts the poly situation is already relaxing as many new plants come online </s> <s> The question is will these thin film and CPV solutions still be attractive in a world that is not silicon-constrained In a world where the <smiley> market is being flooded by low-cost mid-efficiency crystalline <smiley> technology from China while a few of the more technologically positioned crystalline <smiley> players duke it out for high-efficiency dominance and where vertical integration appears to bring some distinct advantages Finally factor in that solar thermal powerplant technology like the SEGS plants or for a less proven example Stirling dishes looks pretty attractive for the really big centralized solar power plant market </s> <s> In other words who\ is going to win It\ is a tough one but that\ is a question I would recommend answering to your own satisfaction before choosing to sign on the dotted line </s> <s> Now the foregoing was perhaps more focused on the tech-type jobs but there are other opportunities out there </s> <s> For instance there are any number of installation companies out there ranging from Mom and Pops to installers that are becoming regional or even national players catering to the residential retrofit and commercial markets </s> <s> It\ is physical outdoor construction work </s> <s> If you have the right skill-set it\ is a good job and you\'re bound to learn something about solar </s> <s> But still do your homework understand their business plan and understand how the job might change if your employer goes public or gets acquired - and don\'t be shy about asking a potential employer about specifically what\ is in it for you in one of these cases </s> <s> So - the best of luck to all those interested in getting a job in this space </s> <s> If you are serious I can definitely recommend showing up at Solar Power <date> in Long

A Fire In My Kitchen may not agree I am willing to go easy with the lack of the Table of Contents because the book\ is function is to produce recipes for the diabetic population and it is published by the American Diabetes Association and all proceeds from the book go to this worthy charity </s> <s> Thus major mistakes which would get me to cringe in a recipe cookbook where the author is making all

these small paintings as they come off the easel over the next few weeks as well as share some of my tips for painting when traveling </s> <s> So here is my first travel tip </s> <s> When traveling I recommend you try painting on panels instead of canvas </s> <s> First because panels are easy to pack and you can buy them at most art stores these days </s> <s> Most airlines are a \'ing baggage charges for weight and second bags these days and I managed to fit all my clothes and painting supplies for three weeks into one suitcase </s> <s> You can also make your own panels when you get to your destination from supplies available most places I did a post that shows you how </s> <s> In fact unless you are planning to paint big paintings panels are the way to go in my mind </s> <s> On the other hand if you are set on canvas I have found the best approach is to pack a variety of stretcher bars taped together and ship a roll of canvas to where you are painting </s> <s> That way you only have to bring the bars staple gun and pliers on your flight </s> <s> If you are bringing large stretcher bars you are probably not going to be able to fit these in a suitcase so that means some extra costs </s> <s> When you stretch your canvas upon arrival I did a post on that too leave enough edge overlap so as to be able to un -stretch your work </s> <s> That way you can simply roll it up and take it home in a mailing tube when you leave </s> <s> Okay so there is a few tips for painting when traveling </s> <s> For my current trip I decided to use Ampersand Gessobord </s> <s> These panels are a bit more expensive than the ones I make at home but not as expensive as some of the others out there </s> <s> I started using these in my studio about 8 months back and I am totally a \'icted </s> <s> The surface is so nice and has just the right tooth for taking paint and the quality and consistency is high </s> <s> I am not paid to promote their products but I can recommend them without hesitation </s> <s> The panels come in various sizes and you can cut them to size </s> <s> These are widely available these days so you have probably seen them at your local art store </s> <s> So there you go hope you get a chance to paint outdoors during the summer </s> <s> And maybe even get a vacation somewhere so you can paint something new </s> <s> If so I will be offering a few tips over

to get more careful at that point </s> <s> I think my recent experience also shows some important points to take into account when you think about where and how to send your work out </s> <s> First and foremost it is important to find a gallery or event that is interested in work and represents similar artists and or types of work </s> <s> I wrote about this early in my blog </s> <s> But it is worth repeating </s> <s> If you are painting\'cowboys and indians\' don\'t send your work to a New York gallery you won\'t garner much interest </s> <s> However the good news is that they may be very excited in Tuscon </s> <s> In the end you need to decide before sending out work if it is likely to appeal to a certain gallery or jurist </s> <s> In my case I think it was the fact that my paintings were so different from all the other painterly and more formal painting that was submitted to the show that it simply did not fit with the show or what was running through the jurist\ is mind </s> <s> You want a show that hangs well together--not necessarily to show every type or style submitted--even I can understand that </s> <s> Anyway I thought I would share this experience so you will be prepared </s> <s> I know some of you are thinking about trying to break into galleries and submit your work to a show </s> <s> If you are interested in reading more about how to better showcase your work and build your career as a visual artist I will again recommend Cay Lang\ is book \'Taking the Leap\' </s> <s> I have mentioned it several times in my blog but it is a great book </s> <s> I went back to reading it again after my recent experience and I could quickly see some of the mistake I made in submitting work to the regional exhibit </s> <s> First of all as I previously mentioned these types of modern hard edge \'color space\' paintings don\'t really fit the style of the venue or the other art being shown there </s> <s> So a tepid reception was probably inevitable </s> <s> Second I don\'t think they together really represent a cohesive artistic statement yet since they are still evolving in terms of style and technique </s> <s> This is not to say they are bad paintings they are

time from point to point will be towards clarity toward the elimination of all obstacles between the painter and the idea and between the idea and the observer \' --Mark Rothko I though this was a fitting quote for the above painting and relates back to my own experience lately </s> <s> As you know I have making a radical change in my painting style over the last few months and I have been getting a lot of questions as to \'why\' The short answer can be found in the above quote in that I felt a real need to simplify my work and eliminate the obstacles between what I was trying to say in my paintings and to send that idea more directly to the observer </s> <s> The above painting \'These Five Words in my Mind\' was motivated by a very simple idea that I had been thinking about for a few months that is how do words and colors relate And could you make a painting that had the effect of words in terms of evoking a response of the observer And how could you change the colors and shapes to change the meaning and sensation of a painting Let me explain </s> <s> Let\ is say you have five words </s> <s> There are a lot of different things you can say with those five words </s> <s> Change one word and you can chance the entire meaning of what you are saying </s> <s> Take for example the two phrases \'I would hate to love you\' and \'I would love to hate you\' </s> <s> These phrase contain the same six words but you immediately feel different depending on which one is said </s> <s> In a way color is the same way </s> <s> You can make a lot of different paintings with a set of five colors and if you change one color the entire sensation will also change </s> <s> Of course most paintings have dozens or thousands of colors but do they need all of them Which ones are important to send the meaning And which ones will change the meaning of the painting these are the questions I was asking myself when I thinking about the above painting </s> <s> For this painting I purposely chose five colors you would probably never see reflected in water and except the blue would not likely make anybody think \'water\' </s> <s> Then I tried to make a painting that said \'water\' on one hand through the subject matter but in a very minimal way </s> <s> In fact the main purpose was to combine five colors into a certain sensation that is to send a sensation through a certain color \'note\' or harmony </s> <s> Also I used shapes moving from larger to smaller and hard edge to soft to give the painting a sense of moving back in space so that the five colors soon become \'color\' \ ispace\' and \ isensation\' all at the same time- by combining in your eye just like a certain phrase would or even five music notes do as they are uttered or played </s> <s> You cannot hear the individual words or notes only feel the sensation </s> <s> I know it probably all sounds pretty crazy but that is what I was thinking about before I started this painting and while I was painting it the sensation of five words running around my head </s> <s> Okay so how does this relate to the subject of this post Well I have been thinking a lot about how paintings communicate and what that means for how artists might approach their paintings </s> <s> One of the things I think is important is that an artist at least be clear about the motivation for painting before moving to the easel </s> <s> I have heard instructors say that you must \'have one idea\' or that you should \'focus on the main idea of the painting\' while you paint </s> <s> I have known that to be true based on my own experience </s> <s> When I start to paint with one idea in mind say capturing the feeling of a sunset and then start focusing on something else half way through such as the the color of the mountains it is more than likely going to led to a bad painting </s> <s> The fact is that a successful paintings are those that deliver a clear message to the observer as simply as possible </s> <s> If the artist is not clear how can he she expect the observer to see it clearly So what does this mean for starting a painting Well obviously I think the first step is to make sure you know what you want to say before you start a painting </s> <s> That is do you want to say something about something you are seeing feeling or something that pleases you visually Keep that idea in your mind as you plan and work on the painting </s> <s> Make it as simple as possible </s> <s> My experience is this simple approach will lead to better outcomes </s> <s> Successful paintings require a lot of pre-meditation </s> <s> Many painters and students focus so much on the mechanics of painting color mixing and drawing they forget about the \'why\' </s> <s> So next time you are about to start a painting </s> <s> Take a few moments to think about why you have chosen the subject </s> <s> Ask some hard questions about what attracts you to that subject or landscape </s> <s> Really work through your motivation for starting a painting before you start mixing colors and drawing on the canvas and stick with this idea throughout </s> <s> Try to get that idea onto the canvas </s> <s> When you step back from the canvas ask yourself not if looks like the subject matter but if it feels like it </s> <s> Not if the drawing is good but if the sensation is good </s> <s> Does the figure feel like it is standing Not is the gesture correct but does it feel correct Why is this important because when the observer sees your work this is what he she will feel right away more than any amount of good drawing or careful color mixing </s> <s> The idea or message of a painting comes to the viewer in one quick moment as a feeling like five spoken words and so you need to be sure that you are communicating and assessing your paintings at that level </s> <s> Okay I know this is a bit touchy feely for some of you </s> <s> But I hope you got something out if it </s> <s> All the best

so let\ is get to the point of this post which is how to use \'color references\' in the studio </s> <s> I have increasingly found that I am nearly blind when it comes to color </s> <s> I know that sounds strange but the light in my studio is always changing my mood changes and even my sight seems to change when I am in the studio </s> <s> I look at a color at one moment and it looks greenish and then two minutes later it looks to have change to a bluish color </s> <s> I have written about this in some previous posts but I think color is the hardest part of being an artist </s> <s> It is such a moving target even for a trained artist </s> <s> One solution I have come to increasingly rely on is the uses of color reference materials </s> <s> That is pieces of color that I have lying around my studio that can serve as a neutral reference point </s> <s> For example in just moving from the easel to the palette sometimes my thoughts about a color change </s> <s> I might think I have the right color when I am mixing it on the palette and then get to the canvas and change my mind </s> <s> So which color is right The one I was seeing on the palette or the one I have on my brush It depends of course on what color I was after </s> <s> Which I might have forgotten by the time I am ready to make the stroke since I am daydreaming about something else most of the time anyway Color references don\'t need to be expensive or complicated </s> <s> They can be pieces of paper you paint yourself or colored paper that you buy </s> <s> You can use a color matching system such as Pantone or make up your own system </s> <s> Color charts are also a popular way of color referencing and can be keyed back to the paints you are using </s> <s> Basically what you want from a color referencing system is something that you can refer to that is unchanging Examples of color references that I have used in my own studio include PMS swatches color-aid paper and premixed color charts </s> <s> The key to using a color reference is to understand what it can and can\'t do </s> <s> A color reference is not a solution to a problem </s> <s> It is not a preset color harmony that you can use in a painting I don\'t think this is possible anyway </s> <s> The benefits of a color reference system in my mind are two </s> <s> First it is a tool you can use to work out how colors and values will affect each other before you put them onto the canvas </s> <s> In some ways this can lead to new color harmonies but in my experience it can also keep you from mixing the wrong colors or going in circles </s> <s> Second and in my mind equally important color references can be used to bridge the gap between the color you are seeing in your mind and the one you are mixing on the palette </s> <s> For example when you think \'blue\' what blue are you thinking about </s> <s> If you can pick out the \'blue\' you want from a color reference system before you start mixing then you can more quickly know if you mixed the right color </s> <s> If you are not convinced yet try this experiment </s> <s> Think about a color you want to use in your paintings </s> <s> Say a sky color or the color of the grass on a sunny day </s> <s> Next time you are in the studio try to mix it </s> <s> Or better yet look out the window and mix it based on what you are seeing </s> <s> Once you have mixed the color put it aside for the moment </s> <s> Next find a piece of paper or other reference material that is as close as possible to the color you are after </s> <s> You can again compare it directly by holding it up to the window for example </s> <s> Now mix the color again but with the reference color sitting on your palette </s> <s> Now go back and compare the color you mixed when you did not have the reference and the one you mixed when you had the reference nearby </s> <s> Which is closer to the color you were after I think you will see my point pretty quickly </s> <s> Having a neutral reference can get you closer to where you are going--and faster </s> <s> I am a strong believer in having as much information around you as possible when you are in the studio </s> <s> Photos are an accepted material for artists to use </s> <s> But this is only one form of information and not a very good one at that I also am a firm believer in color references </s> <s> There are numerous ways to

This post has been lurking in my mind for a couple of weeks--and is motivated by one of the key issues I see people struggling with in their paintings </s> <s> Often we stand back from the easel--and wonder what is wrong with a painting and think\'color\' </s> <s> But which color Most of the time we look at the higher value and high chroma hues and start messing around with those--but in fact it may be the shadows that are the problem </s> <s> Frankly I see this over and over in my students work--they pay a lot of attention to the colors where the light is hitting an object or the landscape--but then mix up some pretty boring or even plain bad shadow colors </s> <s> The first message I want to get across is shadows are colors Let me say it again another way the color you are putting in the shadow is just as important as the color you are putting on the highlight </s> <s> If either one is wrong--the painting will suffer </s> <s> Okay so how do you find the right shadow color Well first you need to be able to see the shadow color </s> <s> So let me give you a little exercise that I have learned that will help developed your mind and eyes to better see shadow colors </s> <s> If you do this exercise regularly it will improve your painting </s> <s> I promise </s> <s> It is a little exercise I call \'find the shadow color\' </s> <s> The exercise starts by finding a piece of paper that is a single color and at least around four or five inches square in size </s> <s> It doesn\'t matter where it comes from--out of a magazine book cover or simply paint a piece of paper </s> <s> Next take the piece of paper and put it a few feet away from you in a location where it is being hit by light </s> <s> It can be natural light coming in from a window if you are in the studio <math> or light from a lamp </s> <s> Doesn\'t matter </s> <s> Once you have your color paper sitting there take a moment to really notice the color </s> <s> Take a long look--try to remember what it looks like </s> <s> Is it warm or cool What is the hue Try to memorize the color </s> <s> Next take the same piece of paper and put it somewhere nearby where it is not being hit by light--but the color is still observable not in the closet </s> <s> For example if you had the paper sitting on a table put it on the floor next to the table in the shadow of a table </s> <s> If it was in the light coming in a window put it in a place where the light is not directly hitting it </s> <s> Notice the change in color </s> <s> Take a long look--try to remember what the new color looks like--how did it change when you moved it out of the light Did it get warmer or cooler What is the hue Again try to memorize the color--and think about how it compares to the color when it was lighted </s> <s> Move it back and forth between light and shadow and notice what happens </s> <s> Okay now the fun part </s> <s> Go and find another piece of paper or paint one that is the color of the paper when it is not being hit by light </s> <s> This is a lot harder than it sounds </s> <s> I did this in my office the other day and it took me a good fifteen minutes to find two objects where the color of one was the shadow color of the other </s> <s> The test that you have the right color is simple </s> <s> Put the two pieces of paper in light together then move the original piece the one you first chose and observed in light into the shadow </s> <s> If you have the right shadow color the two pieces of paper should appear to be the same color </s> <s> Below are some pictures to give you a better idea of how this works </s> <s> The first photo below is of the two pieces of paper that I determined were shadow and highlight colors </s> <s> They are actually the covers of two publications I had sitting around my office </s> <s> This is how they look sitting on my desk as lighted by the lighting in my office </s> <s> So how do I know that the darker color is the shadow color of the lighter one Simple I put the lighter color on the floor off the edge of my desk so that I could see them next to the other </s> <s> In effect so that the darker one was in the light but the lighter one was in shadow </s> <s> Below is a photo of the result--taken with the darker one sitting on the desk and the lighter one on the floor in shadow </s> <s> You can see that they have effectively become the same color </s> <s> And yes the one on the floor is the lighter color in the above photo </s> <s> Hard to believe I know </s> <s> Try this exercise in various lighting conditions and types of light </s> <s> Finding two colors that work may be a bit of a struggle at first but you will get better at it </s> <s> If you do it as a regular exercise you may be surprised how it improves your ability to paint shadow colors the first thing you will notice is that shadows are colors--and they have predictable relationships </s> <s> Your mind will remember how colors in shadow and light relate--which will make you quicker at finding the right shadow color </s> <s> There are a lot of variations on this exercise that can help you out in the studio </s> <s> For example say I was painting a still life with an object in it that I was having a hard time finding the right or even simply believable shadow color </s> <s> A simple guide might be to paint a piece of paper the color I was using for the object in light and another piece the shadow color I was using </s> <s> Then I could do the same as I did above to compare the shadow color to othe other paper\'in shadow\'--and if the relationship was correct </s> <s> Even if the match was not perfect I would expect the temperature and general hue would be in the same range </s> <s> If the two colors are off--you will see it pretty quickly--trust me </s> <s> One of the things you will notice right away is that the shadow color of something in natural light is much cooler that a shadow of the same object indoors under normal house lighting </s> <s> Which means for example that the relationships indoors are different than those you would see if you did the same exercise with the same colors outdoors </s> <s> Which means that if you are painting landscapes use natural lighting for the exercise--and preferably do it outdoors </s> <s> Also the shadow color of an object will vary with the distance you are away from it </s> <s> So if you move one of the pieces of paper closer or farther away from you--the relationships change </s> <s> So think of it as a way to train your eyes and guide your thinking--not a scientific experiment </s> <s> So there you go </s> <s> A simple exercise to help you explore shadow colors--and to get </s> </s>

</s> <s> Looking to warm up and escape the rain we asked for directions to the local pub </s> <s> We were directed to The Old Cliffside Brewery and no sooner had we sat down than we were approached by an old dwarf named Keller </s> <s> Old Keller told us about how the village was being terrorised by a band of goblins and asked if we could help </s> <s> He seemed truly concerned and when it was clear he was speaking for the whole town when he offered us 25 gold each to help rid the town of these goblin raiders </s> <s> Benadrix tried to squeeze some more gold out of him but Keller said the best he could do is the 25 gold and free food and lodging while we were in town </s> <s> Marrek agreed first and predictably Gnasc was quick to agree too </s> <s> When I agreed that I would help too I was afraid Benadrix would part ways and our short friendship would be over but he too agreed to help the village but only after he was given a room and a nights rest </s> <s> Old Keller took us to the only inn in town Aunt Nonnie\ is </s> <s> Keller secured us four rooms and Aunt Nonnie was clear that it was costing her 5 silver apiece but she was happy to do so if we could rid the town of the goblins </s> <s> Not needing to sleep I thought about just asking for the silver but I didn\'t want to cause any problems within our fledgling group </s> <s> Aunt Nonnie seemed empty except for the four of us so we headed back over to the Old Cliffside Brewery to see if we could gather any more information on these raids </s> <s> When we entered the pub this time Gnasc noticed an elf in the corner who was spending a little more time looking at us than anyone else in the room </s> <s> He was also equipped much differently than the locals with a bow and two fine swords my guess is that he is a ranger </s> <s> We approached him thinking he may know more about these goblins than others </s> <s> He was not very interested in talking and in fact tried to turn use away from his table until Benadrix convinced him otherwise </s> <s> If he knew anything he did not let on talking to him was almost as productive as talking to a wall even after Marrek bought him a drink </s> <s> After a few fruitless minutes of trying to talk to him Marrek went to talk to Old Keller and the bartender Orek Gernsan </s> <s> It turns out that the Cliffside Brewery has been hit hard by these raiders about half of the shipments to neighboring towns have been hit </s> <s> Gernsan asked us to bring back any of these lost shipments that we may find </s> <s> After a restful night in the inn Old Keller took us to the entrance of the catacombs that he believed the goblins were hiding out in </s> <s> Gnasc snuck in first I am still amazed at how stealthy he is for being even bigger than me and checked the room </s> <s> There were three goblins seated around a table </s> <s> Eager to prove myself to my friends I rushed in with them right behind me </s> <s> We had a bit of a rough fight especially after two more goblins appeared from the shadows </s> <s> While it may not have been the prettiest fight we were able to defeat our foes and after searching the room we also found a pouch with 40 gold inside </s> <s> After a short rest we followed another hallway where we found some more goblins one who seemed to have just finished up some kind of ritual </s> <s> Gnasc was not able to sneak in on this group of goblins </s> <s> The Hexer in the back of the room summoned some rats who launched themselves with reckless abandon at us </s> <s> Benadrix and I quickly tried to make our way to the Hexer thinking he would be the biggest threat in the room but before we could reach him he summoned two large fire beatles and Gnasc and Marrek were separated from us by them </s> <s> We fought hard and did much better than the previous battle </s> <s> Though he was bloodied we were unable to stop the Hexer from escaping through a door to another room </s> <s> Taking a moment to gather ourselves we searched the room and I found a large gem in the bottom of the brazier </s> <s> The door the Hexer went through opened up to a large room with a vicious looking statue overlooking a large pit in the floor </s> <s> There was a large Dire Wolf behind an iron grate with two goblins standing guard near it </s> <s> One of them too close to a leaver that most certainly would set the Dire Wolf free </s> <s> The Hexer was across the room and there was another even more ornately dressed goblin across the pit from us along with a smaller wolf </s> <s> There were also quite a few goblins in the room as well </s> <s> Early on in the fight I was magically pulled into the pit by the Warcaster and shortly after that Marrek was also dropped into the pit </s> <s> I helped him escape and when I managed to climb out my friends had cleared much of the room and to my relief the Dire Wolf was still caged </s> <s> I was able to finish off the Warcaster but the Hexer while still recovering from our last battle still put up a good fight </s> <s> He was able to pull the lever to free the Dire Wolf just before he died </s> <s> The Dire Wolf was in a frenzy by the time the gate opened but it was so bloodthirsty that it did not put up much of a fight </s> <s> I felt bad for having to kill the Dire Wolf but it was so worked up having been caged by those goblins we did not have a choice </s> <s> We discovered a locked door and while Marrek Gnasc and I struggled with it Benadrix busied himself with pushing the statue into the pit </s> <s> We were unable to open the door but we did find a crued map of Harken on the Warcaster with the Brewery marked along with the estate of Baron Stockmer </s> <s> There was also a note about capturing villagers for slaves </s> <s> There was a second door blocked by lots of rubble clearly done by the goblins </s> <s> While interested in the door we were exhausted from the fights and thought it best to warn the town of what we found </s> <s> We were unable to find any of Gernsan\ is shipments but perhaps they are behind the locked door </s> <s> I am also interested to find out what has the goblins so scared they would block off the door in the last room </s> <s> I also need to learn more about Baron Stockmer </s> <s> Also after spending the first years of my life in something like slavery I will not let any of these villagers be subjected

keeper of the floors for the day area and much of the dorm </s> <s> Yeah we allegedly have porters but this is one dorm where porters get away with not doing their jobs </s> <s> More on this to follow </s> <s> But for the last four or five months I have been responsible for mopping up the day area after 11 30 PM </s> <s> Then starting in November that included stripping the floors and now I have put over eight coats of wax on them </s> <s> This Sunday evening I decided to not only mop the floors but do some buffing and rewaxing too </s> <s> Just mopping the floor usually involves at least two or three changes of the water in the buckets </s> <s> One for the soap one to rinse </s> <s> So after doing a super special mop job I start using the high speed buffing machines to both remove some of

morning just in time to make me a bowl of oatmeal and start laying the first three coats of wax in the dorm area </s> <s> This takes me till about 12 00 noon and then I have lunch which was another gift of venison and up to the chapel I go both at 3 00 and again at 7 00 PM for two hours each time to work on the clerk stuff and computer program I am trying to do in Excel which is a trip since there are no help files installed </s> <s> But what I can do is record macros which are shown in Visual Basic and try to edit them into workable code </s> <s> I arrived back at the dorm around 9 00 PM and napped for about 90 minutes and was back up at 11 PM to mop the floors </s> <s> I got to bed around 1 00 AM this morning but was up at 7 00 AM to put more wax on the floors </s> <s> Today we ended having our inmates move out of the dorm and as a result a couple guys got to move into single cubes from the double cubes and then we had a few new guys come in </s> <s> So this high tech operation prohibited me from waxing today </s> <s> I need to get about eight coats of wax to have the floor really shine </s> <s> So instead of trying to catch up on my sleep I ended up heading up the hill to

three boxes of oatmeal ten packets in each </s> <s> I use two at a time and two jars of peanut butter plus two loaves of wheat bread for my lunch </s> <s> The meals would be pasta or bean dishes </s>

know how much of what Darnell -- oops so used to staff people calling inmates by their last name -- is saying is possibly the truth nor what Ray says is the whole story either </s> <s> It still amazes
