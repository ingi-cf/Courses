<s> Chile Earthquake and Spiritual Promptings On the LDS Church News website last week there was an article about the earthquake in Chile and how the mission there had already been preparing for an earthquake in the weeks leading up to the quake <s> The article is an e-mail written by Sister Lisa Laycock wife of Chile Santiago East Mission President Larry Laycock and originally sent to her friends and family after the quake <s> Here is an excerpt 'When we were set apart for this calling Elder Richard G Scott of the Council of the Twelve Apostles taught us many important lessons <s> He spoke from personal experience when he was a mission president in Argentina <s> One message that he shared with us is this 'At times during your mission you will be awakened in the mi 'le of the night or the early morning hours with thoughts of specific things you should do for certain missionaries <s> Do not ignore these thoughts <s> They are promptings from the Holy Ghost who will communicate with you in the stillness of the night or the peace of the early morning hours <s> He will speak to you then because that is when you are still enough to hear ' Elder Scott further instructed us to keep a notebook beside our bed so that we could record these precious promptings <s> He said that by the next morning we would be likely to forget the promptings if we didn 't write them down 'We have been astonished at the fulfillment of Elder Scott is prophetic words <s> We have received many promptings in the exact manner that Elder Scott described <s> We are so thankful that Elder Scott taught us how to recognize and act upon these precious promptings <s> Had he not taught us we may not have given these promptings the attention they require 'Nearly two and one half weeks before the earthquake I was awakened at around 4 a m by just such a prompting <s> I did not hear a voice but the thought was as clear as if it had been in the form of spoken words 'There is going to be an earthquake <s> Prepare your missionaries ' I sat up in bed and immediately remembered Elder Scott is counsel <s> That morning I told Larry what had happened <s> He immediately set to work organizing our missionaries to prepare for an earthquake 'In talking with our office missionaries to arrange for them to put together a list of everything we would need to prepare in both Spanish and English we discovered that the Lord had also let two of our office missionaries know of the possibility of an earthquake in the form of dreams and the need to prepare our mission <s> We set a goal and arranged our schedule so that we could visit every apartment in the mission to check for safety and to review with our missionaries what to do in case of an earthquake <s> What a wonderful experience we have had as we have met with them and shared scriptures with them about being spiritually and physically prepared ' if ye are prepared ye shall not fear ' <smiley> C 38 <math> <s> We instructed every missionary to have a 'go-bag ' <math> hour kit <s> We reviewed our emergency action plan with them of where to go and what to do if they had phone service and in case they did not <s> We gave everyone a paper with all instructions in English and Spanish and we reminded them that 'this life is the time to prepare to meet God ' Alma 34 <date> <s> We shared with them our thoughts and feelings about the need for spiritual and physical safety <s> Some of them became frightened and asked us if we knew something they didn 't know <s> We smiled and repeated ' if ye are prepared ye shall not fear ' We didn 't want to unduly alarm them but we did want to impress upon them the need to be prepared <s> We tearfully reminded them of our recent transfer conference where we had shared our feelings about our dear Elder <weirdcaps> Burrows who was unexpectedly called home in January while serving his mission in Romania how he was prepared in every way to meet God <s> We reissued our challenge to 'be prepared ' in every way <s> Then we knelt with them in their apartment and dedicated each apartment asking for a blessing of safety and security to be upon every apartment 'When the earthquake came we were prepared <s> We did not experience the panic that many felt <s> We knew we were prepared <s> Because of the words of the Lord is chosen apostle Elder Scott we had listened and heeded the quiet but clear promptings of the Holy Ghost <s> We were blessed with peace in the midst of chaos <s> We learned an important lesson our preparation helped us to avoid panic and fear but the Lord in His wisdom allowed us to experience enough discomfort to know that He has all power <s> He is in charge <s> We are nothing without Him <s> We are dependent upon Him for every breath we take <s> Only He can save us from death and destruction <s> He is the way the truth and the life <s> He is our perfect example <s> If we follow Him we will be saved through obedience to the laws and ordinances of His Gospel 'As the earthquake became more violent the mission home groaned and wailed <s> The power died so the whole city was black <s> The windows made a hideous screeching sound and flying objects banged against swaying walls <s> The printer fax machine books book ends and fifty-pound television burst from the entertainment center and crashed to the floor cabinets emptied drawers flew open the refrigerator moved water sloshed out of the toilets the floor jolted up and down as we ran across it trying to hold onto the walls to keep from falling down and the piano toppled over like a small toy <s> As we made our way to the back yard I remember thinking 'God is all-powerful <s> He is our only refuge from this horrible mess ' I prayed and prayed for Him to still the earth <s> When we reached the back yard we watched in terror <s> By the light of the moon we could see the swimming pool water form giant waves and crash out onto the rocks <s> House and car alarms screamed into the night some from being crushed by falling debris and others I guess from the bizarre movement of the earth <s> I am not sure if the intense rumbling sounds came from the earth itself or from everything else that was shaking so violently <s> Finally it stopped <s> When the calm came we had to sit down because our legs were weak and unstable <s> My legs stayed wobbly all day and night yesterday <s> Today Feb <math> the muscles in my legs hurt like I ran a marathon <s> The aftershocks have been extremely unsettling <s> Each one begins like the one last night started <s> We just close our eyes and wait to see if it escalates or dies down <s> I have never experienced anything like this 'Wow The description of the earthquake was pretty cool to read I don 't think I would ever want to experience that myself <s> But the description of how the mission was already preparing for the earthquake was even more amazing <s> Heavenly Father really cares about us and he does provide us with spiritual promptings if we care to listen <s> What would have happened if this sister and the other missionaries had decided to ignore the prompting they received I am sure all the missionaries and their families are grateful that the three individuals who received promptings to prepare for an earthquake were in tune enough with the Holy Ghost to realize that it was a warning and take action

richest members of the council <s> He needed no introduction <s> The Jindal Textile Corporation had been the most powerful and successful industry in India for the past 15 years and had only doubled in its value ever since Mr <s> Ryan inherited it after his father five years back <s> Ryan had been an MBA fresher when he took up the responsibility everybody knew there was something else in the man that made him what he was- the king of the Jindal empire <s> He had the strong and slender build of an athlete and was dressed in a black suit tailored to perfection <s> His body looked chiselled with not a single vestigial muscle <s> His face was angular with a sharp pointed nose he had black curls that fell over his broad forehead <s> And his eyes people who conversed with him rarely looked at his eyes they made one uncomfortable <s> They played a huge contrast to the sophistication and aristocracy his clothes displayed <s> On the surface they were insolent and impersonal but anyone with a little more insight could see that they were only a screen to something more savage and terrifying like the fores of nature bottled up in human form At present he was completely bored of the flattery he was being entitled to by a group of businessmen around him <s> They were saying something about him being the responsible son and the future badshah of the textile world <s> He smiled and no 'ed appropriately to all the comments but his eyes were shifting scrutinising the groups of people around the room <s> Su 'enly they fixed onto someone someone standing with Mr <s> Ashok being introduced to some others <s> His eyes never lost sight of her for a moment <s> He stared at her as she stood there- tall slender- a picture of elegance <s> Her face wore a smile- a smile that reflected beauty and self- confidence but more than everything they deepened her eyes and the colour on her cheeks <s> A simple sari of blue silk adorned her but she looked like she would hardly have looked less elegant in a pair of jeans or trousers <s> For a few moments Ryan looked at her and then turned back to the conversation immediately around <s> After a quarter of an hour he heard Mr <s> Ashok is voice 'Mr <s> Ryan may I introduce to you Miss <s> Tamanna and Ms ' 'Mr <s> Ryan Ryan Jindal I know him quite well Mr <s> Ashok ' 'That is my pleasure Ms <s> Tamanna ' Ryan stretched out his hand his eyes looking straight at her as if he were challenging her <s> She met his eyes with defiance and took his hands coolly <s> Even as their fingers touched his palm enclosed hers <s> The warmth from him seemed to spread all through her <s> Her eyes wavered just an instant and she was the first one to withdraw her hands For a moment there was troubled silence and then Tamanna composed herself and managed a weak smile 'Nice to meet you Mr <s> Ryan ' 'Of course Ms <s> Tamanna looking forward to see more of you ' In sometime Ryan took leave <s> He never stayed back for the Council dinners <s> As he walked back towards his car he thought of her again <s> There was something about her in her poise but she had wavered from that at his touch <s> The thought made him happy though no girl had ever resisted his touch <s> But he knew this had been different <s> She had been genuinely surprised perhaps troubled at her own response <s> He would find out more soon <s> Thinking so he directed his remote at his car <s> Something was wrong it refused to open <s> He pressed again no response 'Is anything the matter Mr <s> Ryan That is my car ' Tamanna stood loking at him hands folded a smug smile on her face <s> Now it was his turn to be genuinely surprised 'This is your car ' He had every reason to be surprised <s> The car was the first of its kind in India and he had been the first Indian to get it <s> He loved cars especially huge black ones <s> He would never have imagined anyone elseat the Council to have ever owned one like that <s> She broke into his reverie 'If you 'll please excuse me ' and she pressed the button on her remote <s> The car dutifully opened its door for the rightful owner <s> As she walked past him to get into the car he involuntarily shifted aside and saw his car parked some <date> m away 'Good night Mr <s> Ryan ' she said and just sped off <s> For one moment he stood dumbfound and then a smile crossed his lips a cold cruel smile <s> He had discovered what was different about her <s> After a long time he had been challenged <s> He felt a gush of adrenaline <s> She was an independent will a tigress <s> He would possess her he decided 'Very soon ' were the only words that came out of his mouth 
<s> Music - The fact that we have something called music to appreciate is utterly amazing I consider it one of the ingenious things we discovered mind you not invented <s> The right music just lightens up your day It still amazes me as to how we react emotionally to different frequency of sounds how do we do that <repeatedchars> <s> I am no scientist so won 't delve any deeper <smiley> I know that the genre of music is a touchy subject for some for example i am not a fan at all of heavy metal I detest it but doesn 't mean i wont allow anyone else to decide for themselves Personally i have no particular genre to call my kind of music ' it all depends on my mood when i am up for it <s> I enjoy mostly romantic and soulful music but i also enjoy R B Bollywood and Pop a lot too <s> Of late soft rock and punk rock have caught my eye Green day <smiley> Anyway that is a lot about me just one question how many of you out there listen to a particular song a million times till you are fed up that is my exact story yeah i am quite boring <smiley> Coming to favorites I have way too many so many that they can 't even be called favorites anymore <smiley> Music can REALLY heal it is just a matter of listening to the right songs so go pick up your i-pod phone laptop or any other instrument that plays music and get happy

<s> A few weeks ago Bonnie the more exciteable of the two puppies charged at me in all her enthusiasm and bashed me in the nose <s> It bloody hurt <s> Enough that for the past few weeks I have been taking pain killers and nursing a very sore and tender nose <s> However me being me I thought 'it can 't possibly be Bonnie is fault 'and so I decided I had sinusitis Stop laughing at the back Having never had it before I scoured the Internet for symptoms of which pretty much boiled down to the ones I had <s> Except today I couldn 't stand it any longer and thought it best to see the doctor <s> So off I trudged to his little TARDIS in the next village and let him have a right good look up my hooter <s> Pro 'ing and pressing feeling and caressing asking me about snot and things on my hankie he confirmed that my sinuses are absolutely fine 'Have you knocked it recently 'he asked 'Oh well one of my puppies did a bit since 'I answered Some more feeling took place before he gave his final diagnosis 'You 've broken your nose 'he said <s> He explained how the bones and bits inside work and everything started making sense 
<s> Sleep - I 've missed you The past few weeks have been a little crazy with our little guy <s> For some reason he all of a su 'en decided to loathe going to bed <s> He used to be so easy to put down <s> Give him his pacifier - he starts playing with his hair - and zonk <s> He is out Well he started refusing his pacifier which I at first thought was great because I didn 't want him to have it forever anyway <s> But then a few days later he started with this bed-hating thing and that has been going on for quite some time now <s> We decided it was time to just let him cry it out <s> We 've never really had to decide whether or not to let him cry it out because nap time and bed time had never been an issue before but things changed and we knew he needed to learn to go to sleep and stay asleep by himself So long story short I 've heard a LOT of crying in the past couple weeks but we 're finally about there <s> The past <math> nights he is gone to bed at night with less than a minute or two of crying and he is stayed asleep until about 5 am at which point I feed him and he goes back to bed until about 7 - 7 30 <s> I don 't think he is quite ready for all night yet but we are making progress We 're still figuring out nap time but we seem to be getting back on track there too - much less crying much more sleeping It is just crazy how all of su 'en he can change like that <s> Of course it always happens right as things are going well and stabilizing <s> I even took him to the doctor last week <s> We just didn 't seem to be making any progress and I wanted to make sure nothing was wrong with him I would 've felt really bad about making him cry it out if he had an ear infection or something <s> But nothing was wrong <s> I think it was just a combination of teething growing wanting our constant attention and going through some new developments - crawling standing etc So anyway this week has been much happier <s> He wakes up happy now and is much happier during the day too <s> Babies really do need their sleep and they get pretty miserable when the don 't get it By the way - he hasn 't ever had his pacifier again so I guess that is good <s> Some days I miss it especially at nap time but I am glad it is gone On another note we 've been enjoying some amazing weather Eli and I have spent a lot of time outside and it has been wonderful <s> We go on walks go to the playground nearby and watch the bigger kids play sit on the lawn and eat grass and dirt - oh wait that is just Eli Anyway he is a cutie <s> I bought him a new toy last week at Kid to Kid have you ever been there It is second hand stuff but it is in great condition <s> Most of his toys are hand-me-downs I think I 've only ever bought him one other toy poor kid and he was getting pretty sick of them so we picked up this cool 'new 'toy last week along with a really cute pair of shoes <s> He really likes it and it holds his attention for more than 10 seconds <s> Woohoo So that is probably why my blogging has suffered a bit lately <s> We 've all been tired and cranky but we 're coming out of the fog now <s> Hooray It sure feels good to sleep <s> It is been a long time since I 've slept all night so even though he is not making it all the way until 7 he is doing a lot better than he was and I sure feel a difference <s> So that is what is new We have some exciting things coming up <s> Jeremy is brother is coming in town this weekend and he and his fiancee are coming for dinner on Saturday <s> Then my mom comes into town on Monday and my sister Amy and her 4 kids come into town on Wednesday It 'll be an adventure We 're excited Oh and Happy St <s> Patrick is Day whatever - not a holiday I get excited about and sorry this is the longest post ever <s> POSTED BY SARAH AT 2 14 PM 4 COMMENTS Thank you Thank you everyone for your comments suggestions on car seats and food <s> It was very much appreciated and Eli is enjoying many new foods lately and is eating a TON growth spurt yes <s> We still need to find a car seat we haven 't really gone shopping yet but I 've been looking online at ones you have suggested so thanks I plan on blogging more and putting up pictures later today or tomorrow but for now that is all Thanks again

<s> The Rest of the Story AAPS Budget Part II I think I a 'ressed the largest chunk of the budget with my recent post on personnel costs and my post on revenue enhancements including a look at whether we can increase Medicaid reimbursement <s> Here are a few other thoughts 1 <s> Efficiencies--Some of the reductions--for instance finding efficiencies in ESL teaching and other isplit 'positions--seem like they should have been done long ago if they are feasible Which makes me a little suspicious <s> Are they 2 <s> Transportation--I 've written about my opposition to privatization <s> There is no reason at all to balance the budget on the backs of the lowest-paid staff in the district <s> But there were three other transportation issues raised in the budget forums We should not eliminate Kindergarten mi 'ay bussing <s> That sure would make it hard for working parents to send their kids to district schools unless they replaced it with full-day kindergarten which I think probably costs more than the savings <s> When my oldest started kindergarten I was considering a private school with a full-day kindergarten and if I had started him there and if I was satisfied <s> I doubt the public schools would have seen me for several years At the forum I was asked by my group is facilitator 'Well where did your kids go then at mi 'ay if you were working 'Answer to their preschool where my second child was enrolled all day We should be working with AATA <s> For my high school-aged kids the walk to the AATA bus route is not any further for us than the walk to the AAPS bus stop and it doesn 't take any longer to get to school <s> I think many routes could be eliminated for high school students if we can make it easy <s> UM students just show their student IDs <s> Can 't high school students do the same thing Then we would only need to bus those kids who are not reached by AATA <s> I question expanding the walk zone to two miles <s> It may come to this but I am not a big fan of my daughter walking two miles in the dark in a Michigan winter <s> I don 't want my kids to have to drive to school <s> I don 't want to encourage the culture of driving everywhere and in any case cars are expensive 3 <s> Reducing high school noon hour staff <s> This seems impractical if Pioneer and Huron are closing their campuses at lunch time even to upper class students 4 <s> Reducing substitute expenses--can we do more I understand this refers to changing the scheduling of professional meetings that take teachers out of classes and that might be fine <s> In a 'ition though I recently read a study that assessed teacher absenteeism <s> I have no idea if it is high or low in Ann Arbor but probably that should be assessed--and if it is high maybe there is a way to make it lower <s> I have also wondered if it would be less expensive to assign a building substitute in each elementary school building and more in the mi 'le high schools 5 <s> Reducing administrators--can we do more It is convenient for the district that Maggie Jewett and Michael White are both leaving high school principal positions and it makes it easy to propose reducing one class principal at Huron and Pioneer <s> For mid-year reductions it makes sense to stop there <s> But for next year I believe that we could get by with 1 principal and 2 assistant principals at each high school <s> Before Skyline was established there were 5 at each high school or 10 total <s> Rather than saying that we now need 4 at each high school for a total of <math> why not say that we can get by with 9 I 'll bet that it can even be done by attrition <s> And is it possible that some of the higher-level departments can be consolidated thus allowing us to eliminate some management positions 6 <s> The high school cops <s> Susan Baskett raised this issue as a question at the budget forum I attended <s> Do we need them I will a ' my confusion about them What are they there for What do they do Can we do it for less I don 't know the entire costs but I do often see an empty police car just sitting there even late at night at Skyline and it seems like a waste to me

<s> hello my name is sarah i used to be a cheerleader i am depressed in high school cheerleading was AMAZING it was so much fun it gave me most of the friends i have today our coach SUCKED every year well it was the same lady but because of her we pretty much sucked every year we got basically last at competition all the time but we still had so much fun i still got to compete which is a rush nothing else can ever equal we did cool stuff like wore our uniforms on game days and had bake sales and decorated together and dressed up for homecoming and although we never really 'went anywhere 'as in doing well at competition and stuff i still loved it cheerleading was like my high school life it was fun even when practices sucked and people cried and i got bloody noses it was fun because the people i did it with made it fun and we tried our best and it was good in college i thought i would try cheerleading since i liked it so much in high school but the tryouts were during the summer and i couldn 't make them i thought oh well it wasn 't meant to be in september i saw a huge sign for cheerleading tryouts it was so amazing so i went to them turns out they didn 't have enough people from the summer and needed a bigger team so i tried out but i became the alternate the coach assured me i would not be left out and i would definately have a place on the team and be able to compete if someone got hurt or something happened i was disappointed but decided it would be ok and i would do it practices began they sucked they were <repeatedchars> long and <repeatedchars> boring and i didn 't get to do much because i was an alternate coach lied a bit the team was pretty much all cliquey already and i just didn 't fit in it wasn 't like high school at all where every year when new people joined the team we accepted them and eventually we became a big family they just wouldn 't let me in and so i was always shy and didn 't get to come out of my shell and be the crazy person i really am which is why everyone loves me time passed and i hated cheerleading more and more not the actual sport but just doing it at keene state then one night someone fell on me and i sprained my ankle after that i couldn 't do anything i just sat there i had to come back from winter break like a week early to practice but i still couldn 't do much it was ridiculous and then one day when we were about to leave for an away game the coach told me i was no longer on the team in so many words i cried a lot but i was also pretty happy since i hated it so much today i look back on these two worlds with sadness unlike the people younger then me in high school who got to have a new coach and really make something of themselves those last two years of highschool i got nothing and have only the happy memories but no fulfilling cheerleading career to look back in in college i am like a black sheep of the team everyone pretty much thinks i am a slacker and they dislike me the coach obviously dislikes me since she kicked me off the team so i could never go back to them and even if i wanted to i doubt i would make the team i lost my train of thought and i am still sad so i am gonna go now i am glad i got all that out don 't know how much it helped however i think i am gonna go buy a cheerlading handbook

<s> Okay so this isn 't really a paradigm shift to me just something that I was thinking about recently <s> But maybe it will be a paradigm shift to someone else What makes a hero That we could debate Is a hero a constant state of being like being male or female Or is it something we grow into like being a man or a woman Or is it something we are for a fleeting moment Yet recognized forever Such as an olympic gold medal winner Or is it something that comes and goes Like a world record holder Who knows This I am convinced of though A true hero isn 't made by accomplishing spectacular feats Everybody can be a hero Sometimes you 'll be recognized as a hero by everybody Other times nobody will know except you and God But I am convinced that everyone can be a hero For what is a hero Except someone who simply puts others before themselves When a friend needs a shoulder to cry on And you are there you are a hero When your partner needs a task done And you do it for them even though you don 't have to you are a hero When someone is to blame for something And you take the blame even though you 're at fault You 're a hero even if they never realize it Most of the time opportunities to be a hero are small Overlooked But many times just a small dose of selflessness Could transform you from the person who made the problem worse To somebody is hero Yes you have needs too And there are many times when standing up for what you need is good But there are times when you should forget your own needs And that was one of those times I can 't say what you were thinking But to me the right thing to do seemed obvious If you didn 't feel like being a hero You didn 't have to be You could have ignored the situation Instead you had to go and make it worse Is it really that difficult to see that sometimes what you need just doesn 't matter That the right thing to do is to give up your need for a moment You didn 't have to come and try to help Although if you did you could have been her hero I just think it is so sad That in a moment where you could have been a hero You not only chose not to be But became the enemy The choice seems so clear and so simple to my eyes Maybe its not to yours Yet the fact remains You could have been a hero But you weren 't 
<s> I watched 'The Sound of Music ' tonight for the first time in a long time I saw it at Wal-Mart among various other titles I might have bought but something told me to buy 'The Sound of Music ' I have fond memories of watching it when <smiley> was still cool enough to show things like 'The Wizard of Oz ' 'Ben Hur ' and of course 'The Sound of Music ' once a year I don 't know about y 'all but that was a big deal in my family We REFUSED to miss any of these films the one night a year they came on because we didn 't have a VCR until I was nearly in high school As an adult I 've looked on it simply as nostalgia A breath of fresh air for my polluted adult attitude But tonight 'Aidelwiess ' in particular made me rather misty I never get misty at movies But something struck me about all of it and I didn 't know why until a few scenes later at the ball Captain Von Trapp throws right before Maria leaves for the convent again In the scene Maria and the captain dance an old Austrian folk dance And nostalgia grew into something like regret Why aren 't folk dances appreciated anymore Why does everyone feel the need to booty dance and grab-ass at a party Yes it is true that people still do folk dances and ballroom dancing etc But not MOST people We don 't grow up learning these dances and the folk songs and stories that used to keep the whole of humanity from spiraling off the deep end of despair There is such beauty in these things Real beauty Not what we think of as beauty today the glitz and glam of false airbrushed beauty The whole ' <repeatedchars> shiny ' mentality has never set well with me Shiny has no substance All it does is reflect something back that we like to think we are but aren 't What we are lies in folk dances beautiful melodies like 'Aidelwiess ' with simple lyrics that say nothing of sorrow or how messed up or angry the singer is or how they 'd rather be bumping booties with the ho up the block 'Aidelweiss ' is a song about a flower A flower people And it nearly made me cry Don 't get me wrong though I am all for freedom of expression and my ideas and thoughts are generally fairly liberal and always open-minded Yes I love Tool and The Afghan Whigs and The Beastie Boys But all this needs to be balanced with something purer Everyone needs to try to find their innocence again or at least some part of it Like gemstones or precious metals innocence is rare and it should be treasured even if you only take it out for special occasions

<s> I just finished reading one of my textbooks written by Eugene Peterson and he was talking about discipling relationships and what people need I loved one of his quotes 'Sometimes I need a teacher someone to explain the Scriptures to clarify the Christian belief in some circumstance or relationship But mostly I do not I need to become what I already know Sometimes I need a helper someone to assist me out of a jam someone to keep me accountable to my commitments But mostly I do not I need to enter into the reality that is already God in and around me 'I am pretty passionate about mentorship relationships in the Christian context and I think Peterson hits the nail on the head Too often when we are walking with people we are trying to tell them how to be when they already know We need to do more listening and ask more questions aiming to help each other see the bigger picture of who we are in Christ It could really change things

<s> Socialization and Independence <s> Those are the two main goals that are emphasized by the trainers for START the grant funded training series on educating youth with ASD that I am attending <s> During a training session I learned about two concepts that can be used to help students assimilate into a classroom--especially a general education one rather than a self contained special education room <s> The two concepts are Accommodations and Modifications <s> It might seem that the two terms are interchangeable but they are not <s> They are two distinct approaches to educating students with special needs <s> According to the manual I received accommodations 'are the supports and services that help students validly demonstrate student learning 'Modifications 'are individualized changes made to the content and performance expectations for students 'So accommodating a students means doing something like giving a student a P-touch or a y-shaped pen to help with handwriting as discussed in this post <s> It might be giving a student more time to complete a test or giving a student sound blocking headphones for times when classrooms get noisy or when fire drill tornado drills are expected <s> There are quite a few different ways to accommodate a student with ASD <s> Here is a short list of possible accomodations Adapting the way instruction is delivered by pre-teaching and re-teaching for example Increasing the level of support for the student with ASD via class tutors peer to peer support or by placing the student in groups of students who can appropriately interpret the curriculum expectations Giving preferential seating A 'ressing sensory system needs Organizing the desk are where the student words Providing visual strategies such as visual schedules <s> Modification basically means making the work more doable for the student with special needs with the intent that she or he does not become overwhelmed <s> For example if a student can complete a multiple choice test but has difficulty with too many choices the number of choices can be reduced by blacking out two or three answers on the test for the child with ASD <s> Or with general classroom work it might mean having the student complete selected sections of an assignment as opposed to having them complete all the work <s> Note I hope that I explained everything clearly enough but if you are confused it is likely you are not alone <s> We trainees spent a great deal of time learning about these two concepts during our two-day training session <s> This included completing some exercises so that we could better differentiate between accommodations and modifications <s> Feel free to ask a question via the comment section and I 'll do my best to answer it by consulting my manual or by asking someone else

Sweet a bit fruity and the olives if you save those and eat them just before the last sip they are a perfect end to this drink You can make the Old Fashioned many ways <s> Mainly there are two ways to order it either Sweet or Sour <s> Sweet usually means using Sprite in the mix <s> Some people like to pass on the olives and garnish with cherries and an orange slice <s> You can use whiskey or brandy <s> Brandy makes it sweetest <s> Sour usually means using Squirt in the mix <s> I like the sour version just as much as the sweet <s> I 've had garnishes like green olives and pickled brussel sprouts again <repeatedchars> but really good once you get over the fact it is a pickled brussel sprout haha Whiskey is normally the choice of liquor for the Old Fashioned Sour <s> Try ordering the Old Fashioned outside of the midwest and you will likely see the bartender stumped <s> We tried several times in Denver and usually got something completely different than we wanted <s> It was never the

<s> I like Grapefruit Sierra Mist or the cranberry soda that comes out around the holidays <s> I prefer using diet soda to save myself some calories <s> Garnish orange slice cherries green olives

and Corey Feldman as 'The Two Coreys 'they never really seemed like a good pair to me <s> Just because they made a couple of movies together and they shared the same first name <s> I think that paved the path for failure for both of them because it was almost like they were expected to make movies together even though they really were very different in ways that made for bad movies <s> Don 't get me wrong I loved License to Drive and the Lost Boys <s> But when they got around to Dream a Little Dream that is when they really should have aggressively explored their independence <s> I think they

was disgusted with the shell of a man Corey turned out to be <s> I didn 't understand why he felt his life was so hard he couldn 't face it without some sort of high <s> Then came the fight between him and Corey where he broke down and said that Corey Feldman knew his 'friend 'had molested him and he did nothing to help him <s> My heart ached for him <s> I know that kind of pain <s> It can eat you alive <s> For some reason victims have a common trait they blame themselves for what happened to them <s> The guilt it consumes you <s> To be a successful actor in the prime of his career to have someone rip your innocence from you in such a disgusting way and then know that your only friend doesn 't have your back that explained a lot to me <s> To know that Corey never got counseling for this

weekend I got my first Land of Nod catalog and there were a ton of cute ideas in there One picture captured almost exactly what I envisioned for my boys ' playroom I especially love the chalkboard wall cling panels They come in a set of 4 panels and chalk for <date> Of course I think <date> is a bit steep so I did a search to see what I could find for less I found a great vinyl chalkboard panel for <date> from Etsy com store Wilson Graphics It measures <date> 'Wide by 48 'high <s> The Land of Nod panels when combined measured 38 'x 49 iso for a little less chalkboard space I still get my money is worth I picture applying the chalkboard isideways 'as opposed to how the photo displays it <s> That way I get the look I am going for <s> I also LOVE the funky alphabet letters in the Land of Nod catalog photo <s> In the catalog they are asking for <date> for a set of 51 letters <s> They are not reusable so when they come off they stay off <s> I went on an Amazon hunt to find me a bargain For just <date> I found an adorable complete alphabet set that is reuseable and includes upper and lower case letters I am thrilled with this price I am an Amazon freak so I know I will find something else to buy so I can get my free super saver shipping Maybe I 'll buy these cute number wall decals to go with the alphabet Last night I was at Target with my husband and I was on the prowl to find a good deal for my playroom <s> I came across this cute organizer on sale It is normally <date> but at Target this week it is only <date> That is <date> off So I snagged the second to last one The book rack in the Land of Nod catalog is <date> but you can grab a Kidcraft Sling Book Holder from CSN Stores for just <date> I love the table and chairs set in the photo but I am not at all willing to spend <date> on two chairs and <date> for the table as shown in the catalog <s> The biggest feature I love is the storage under the table and I found this adorable <weirdcaps> table and chair set for only <date> Just think about it for a little more than the cost of one Land of Nod Chair you can get an entire set Or if you like the look of the warm wood with the colorful chairs you can opt for the <weirdcaps> Euro Honey Table with Four Chairs for only <date> I looked at places like Amazon and Wal-Mart and they were <date> higher than Allkidsfurniture com Notice the cute polka dot mat under the table in the photo Land of Nod sells these 'Splat Mats 'for <date> I found one at <weirdcaps> is Artfire shop for only <date> which inludes shipping So let is do the math Land of Nod Play Room <date> Cheapskate Knock Off Playroom <date> which includes the storage organizer and the more expensive table and chair set Pretty Impressive huh Mad Boastings of a Cheapskate Mom

<s> I never really thought about it <s> I was all excited to sport the team gear and get to where we were going <s> Until we arrived some 20 hours later got in a bus and headed straight to the pool for a training session <s> Not only were my legs swollen from the flight but my back and shoulders hated me every stroke I took from shlepping that backpack with 'all the comforts of home 'in it

going to be that 4 week part of the standard deviaton The surgeon the therapists and doctors all saying the same thing 'You will be up and moving around right after the surgery and back doing what you do in no time 'As an athlete <math> weeks was already too long nbsp This theory of 'no 'time was going to be interesting <s> I hit the 6 week anniversary of the operation and had a follow up appointment with the surgeon <s> He told me at this point the incisions and tissues in my knee were healed <s> I still had a bit of swelling and I would now be in a battle with scar tissue for range of motion <s> With 5 <math> weeks of therapy I could walk normally I could do all minor strengthening excersices and from what I could see photo I had lost a LOT of muscle in my leg How hard it is to build up the muscle and how fast it departs So began the battle <s> Playing water polo requires a rather awkward rotating motion we do with our legs 'Eggbeater 'had never seemed stange to me <s> I could do it for hours maybe days <s> Supporting myself in the water was as easy as breathing <s> Yet the scar tissue on either side of my patella tendon and through my capsule was creating a loud 'pop 'doing even the simplest of things <s> Like bending me knee from a straightened postion <s> Wait that happens when you walk <s> Yup not too comfortable with normal linear motions <s> So doing anything even close to water polo was not going to happen <s> Yet <s> It became quite clear that what I was going to struggle with most at that point was maintaining a positive outlook with my what I feel is

frequesntly reminded I am no spring chicken anymore I am not Age is a number <s> I guess until you try and heal something and realize yes you really are 31 <s> Boo But I think my lifestyle- staying

still believe that to be true it just might take a little longer than I previously envisioned <s> I was not leaping around after 4 weeks or 6 not even 10 <s> Uggh <s> Now in the 11th week I have seen the most progress <s> I think I have clawed my way up the mountain I had in front of me <s> Breaking holes in the sheets of ice slipping back down a few times but finally nearing the summit <s> And what kept me going besides the images and sensations of future practices and games floating through my head were appreciating the small moments of joy <s> Like dressing up for Halloween at the therapy

for the first time <s> I got Joshua is CD Simple Times nbsp from a friend last year <s> It was about the same time I was trying to decide what path I should set out on post Olympics <s> And for some reason the sound of his voice was really calming to me <s> I would listen to his music as I walked around Greece or when I was reading or hanging out at home and it would help me think <s> When I found out about his show I had to see him live <s> And again those songs helped to calm my anxiety about the healing process and focus me back on the good <s> And of course taking more pictures <s>

number of agents reading it two offered and then maybe a week or so after I signed with one of the agents the first offer from a publisher came in <s> There were more interested publishers so my agent

be published by FGS later this year <s> I am insanely excited about my new book It is called MY FAKE BOYFRIEND IS BETTER THAN YOURS <s> It is about two 7th grade BFFs who each think each other is

because well I love to meet authors <s> Most recently I saw Heather Brewer author of the best-selling Chronicles of Vladimir Tod series doing a signing at my local B amp N to support the release of book 4 in the series ELEVENTH GRADE BURNS <s> This was a particularly fun author event for me more on that below and Heather did a terrific job a 'ressing her young and not so young audience about her writing career and her books and her characters <s> Here are a few things we learned 1 Give yourself permission to write <s> Not to get all Nike on you but if you want a career as a writer it is not going to happen unless you just do it <s> Although it was something Heather longed for for years she was told by parents and even her beloved librarians that being an author wasn 't really an option and she 'd need a 'real job 'Finally she said after her youngest child started school she discussed her career options with her spouse <s> What would you do he asked her if money didn 't matter and you could do whatever you wanted I want to be an author she told him <s> Then do it he said She proceeded to write find an agent get a book contract and hit high on the New York Times Bestseller List It is OK to give yourself permission to follow your dream <s> But if it takes a supportive encouraging significant other that is OK too 2 Goal setting is important <s> Heather is Brewer is formula butt chair writing <s> Even when she is on tour she writes 1 <date> words a day <s> Books don 't write themselves after all <s> So again just do it 3 Mine the painful stuff for material <s> Heather told the bookstore audience about growing up in a small town where she felt like an outcast and was bullied Except when she spent time in the library 'Bullies don 't know there is a library ishe said She calls upon these experiences as she writes her main character Vladimir Tod <s> Because really who is more of an outcast than a vampire in junior high Heather Brewer is Chronicles of Vladimir Tod books 4 Boys read <s> And they come to author events <s> There were a lot of them and they were excited <s> I sat next to kid named Nick who talked my arm off about the books and characters he loved I asked him what grade he was in 'Sixth 'he told me <s> Then he looked at me paused and sai ' <weirdcaps> 're not in any grade are you ' Another boy raised his hand during the Q amp A and when called on he was so nervous he couldn 't remember his question He did later then asked several more Another boy who seemed kind of shy was in front of me in the singing line <s> With his head slightly lowered he spent several minutes giving Heather a synopsis of the story he wants to get published which sounded really cool <s> These boys love books 5 Authors are rock stars <s> OMG <s> The kids LOVE Heather <s> Love love love <s> A heard a few of them say they 'd been there for hours because they wanted good seats <s> A couple of girls with hair dyed unnatural colors said they wanted to high five Heather and never wash their hands again <s> Four girls drove in from Michigan That is far One girl took a photo with the author ran next door to Kinkos and got an 8x10 printed and came back to get it signed <s> And they were asking questions thoughtful ones that could have only come from devoted fans <s> Tons of them wore vampire smiley face apparel <s> It was the best most enthusiastic bunch of slightly awkward slightly pimply hoodie-wearing tween fans I 'd ever seen <s> I wanted to take them all home with me <s> But I bet they all wanted to go home with Heather Brewer <s> Heather Brewer at the

Schm ais Je suis heureux de vous informer that starting today I am reviving le Debut Author du mois feature on mon blog Those of you who contacted me for First Books You may be hearing from in months to come January is <weirdcaps> is Libby Schmais whose YA debut is The Pillow Book of Lotus Lowenstein released from Delacorte en Dcembre <s> Says Kirkus 'readers of any age will savor Lotus is panache <s> Chick lit par excellence 'You can read a d  licieuse excerpt here <s> Describe your debut YA novel The Pillow Book of Lotus Lowenstein <s> The Pillow Book of Lotus Lowenstein is a diary book by a teenager living in Brooklyn who is obsessed with all things French <s> Lotus feels stifled by her life in Park Slope Brooklyn and fancies herself an existentialist although her real knowledge of that philosophy and actual French words is a little sketchy <s> She and her best friend Joni end up both liking the same guy another Sartre aficionado and things come to a head during a school trip to Montreal challenging both her friendship and her freethinking ideas <s> You 'd published a couple of books for adults what made you write for a YA audience I didn 't consciously set out to write a YA book <s> The character of Lotus appeared to me one day and the voice was a teenage one so I just kind of went with it <s> I think if I had decided to write a modern-day YA novel from the beginning I would have been intimidated because it was out of my comfort zone <s> Why did you choose diary format Have you kept journals at some point Well Lotus is studying The Pillow Book of Sei Shonagan in school a famous Japanese diary book so that is part of the reason I chose the diary format <s> The other reason is that I 've always wanted to write a diary book <s> So many of my favorite books are diary books like I Capture the Castle Bridget Jones ' Diary The Diary of Adrian Mole etc <s> And in answer to your question I have tried to write in many journals over the years and have a stack of half-filled notebooks that are impossible to read because my handwriting is so terrible <s> Like your title character Brooklynite Lotus Lowenstein are you a Francophile and or an existentialist I am definitely a Francophile <s> I love French food speaking French badly and I have recurring fantasy about moving to the South of France preferably near a field of lavender and an outdoor caf <s> I am also a bit of an existentialist particularly on Mondays when life seems trs meaningless <s> How did you end up at Delacorte Do you have an agent I do have an agent the fabulous Stephen Barbara of Foundry Media who hooked me up with Delacorte <s> I actually have a two-book deal so I will have another YA book coming out in approximately a year or so with a totally different character although equally quirky and misguided <s> You 've recently completed the My-Life-Is-Merde-but-Have-a-Bonnes-F 'tes-Anyway Blog Tourapalooza you 've got a fan page on facebook and you blog and tweet as your main character <s> Did I miss anything How are your book promotion efforts going Wow it sounds so exhausting when you put it like that <s> Yes that covers it except for maybe Goodreads which is a great site for authors <s> I have to say all the YA bloggers are a very encouraging and enthusiastic bunch and they 've been very positive about the book so I 'd say the online promotion is going well although I always feel that I could be doing more <s> Can you offer some advice to first-time YA authors Advice <s> <repeatedchars> <s> Probably the same advice I give myself try not to be too influenced by what everyone else is doing and write the story that you need to write <s> And don 't be so hard on yourself <s> Writing is not easy

beautiful but few it seems the daily reports we 'd read were not all that accurate desert sunflower amp lupine we weren 't alone in that thinking either there were droves of people that came for the predicted event everyone asking 'where are the flowers 'the epic wildflower bloom ah well mother nature surely decides these things not us doesn 't she cholla choy-ya cactus so we set about enjoying all the many other treasures the desert has to offer in the desert the best way to see is to get quiet get away from the crowds get down on your knees for a closer look find hearts and think of all your friends and take some hikes we went from this to this we hiked six miles to an oasis you would not guess by looking at these photos that this place is called hell hole canyon can you see the small waterfall we cooled off in blooming agave this photo shows the way we hiked to the palm covered oasis it was over 80 degrees out i seem to have picked up a few stragglers when chuck pointed out a blooming barrel cactus i got so excited i hurried off the trail to see it i forgot to look where i was stepping <smiley> we went on another hike to the breathtaking badlands in one day we did three hikes and covered sixteen miles i think i counted just as many blisters in anza - borrego desert it is okay to camp anywhere we found a beautiful spot but it was so windy we couldn 't put up our tent instead we spread out our sleeping pads and bags in the truck bed and slept there it was fun even if we didn 't get much sleep we listened to the wind and coyotes all night and yes there were stars millions i think we could see every single one we decided to go exploring more of this thousand square mile wilderness we were looking for a place where we read you could see native american rock art and an ancient village we drove and drove and and then hiked and hiked there it is incredible i love this art form pictographs and especially love to imagine the native tribe that painted this driving and hiking a little more we found the kumeyaay morteros here it is we are at a native american village site the kumeyaay ku-may-eye people used this site on a seasonal basis they gathered pinon nuts mesquite beans and desert agave nuts and seeds were pounded into meal in amorteros ' the large depressions in the granite boulders the informative sign said to sit quietly and imagine yourself working along side the kumeyaay women pounding large rock pestles into the morteros grinding seeds and talking over the news of the day we did just that grateful for the experience desert lily on our third day in the desert i was feeling not quite as fresh as this flower but roughing it is part of the fun i do love to camp while out on a drive we passed through the small town of borrego springs chuck told me we needed gas instead he drove up to one of the resorts and he told me we were getting a room for the night he wanted to surprise me for being a good sport he said then we went out to a lovely dinner sometimes camping is overrated <smiley> sandverbena we may not have gotten to see an epic flower show this may not be the year for anza-borrego after all but we did have a wonderful time we gazed at stars splashed in a desert waterfall talked long talks while taking long walks we saw a coyote and heard them every night a roadrunner quail cactus wrens and hummingbirds we saw jackrabbits honeybee is and blister beetles and on our way out of the park in the high desert i saw a nest with a large bird i told chuck i 'd never seen a nest like this before in a tree by the side of the road so he turned around to get a better look it was an eagle we didn 't want to stress the mama so we watched for just a moment and then left i loved this trip buggy windscreen driveby photo of home and apparently so did owen back at home where he and hannah spent the last few days together he went to a surf contest met lots of new friends dogs and people dug lots of holes went to a barbeque and went

is so soft and smells so good it is my favorite thank you sally anne again i loved this yarn i even have enough i think to make a tiny pair of baby booties here is another scarf i made this week it is a scrumptiously soft one piece scarf that you can wear long like this or like this wrapped twice around your neck for a cowl the colors don 't really show it is more of a pinky mauve i used plymouth yarns baby alpaca grande yarn it took two skeins on a size ten needle the pattern was based on a mobius cowl scarf but i couldn 't get the hang of the cast on for that so it is simply a continuous scarf instead i cast on <date> stitch is placed a marker then purled for 4 rounds knit for 4 continuing like that until it was about 8 inches wide that is it so cozy and warm photos are taken with the

from SRS Sudan Radio Service Tuesday 16 March <date> 16 March <date> - Nairobi Paris - The leader of the Darfur anti-government group the Sudan Liberation Movement-Abdulwahid al-Nur faction says he is reluctant to join the Darfur peace talks because the Government of National Unity does not understand the true meaning of peace <s> In an interview with SRS from Paris on Monday Abdulwahid al-Nur said peace is not about the distribution of political influence Abdulwahid al-Nur 'I would like to confirm that we completely differ with the Khartoum government on the peace process in Darfur <s> The Sudanese government believes that peace means giving positions to the anti-government group is leaders or it believes that peace means correcting the consequences of the wrong actions they were responsible for in Sudan <s> But for us peace means ensuring security on the ground first then secondly tackling the root causes of the conflict <s> We have a road map to achieve peace in Darfur <s> Peace starts by conflict suspension or security <s> The government should first stop the genocide against our people disarm their militia the Janjaweed and stop the rape of our women and chase out the new settlers from Mali and Niger <s> The meaning of peace to us is when people feel that they are secure <s> But to GONU peace is giving power to people in Khartoum and in the region and that is all ' Over the weekend the <smiley> Special Envoy to Sudan Scott Gration told the press in Doha that al-Nur has wasted a 'historic 'opportunity to join the peace talks <s> In response al-Nur described Gration as a colonizer who ignores the conflict in Darfur Abdulwahid al-Nur 'To me Gration reminds me of that terrible era when people used to think that Africans didn 't know how to think and they colonized them <s> Particularly the European colonization and the colonization of the white man <s> That is why he comes to terrorize people divide them and gives them the feeling that he is a god and he can destroy them if they don 't abide by his commands <s> Neither Gration nor anyone else in the world can make us miss the opportunity because we own the rights the issues the land and a country <s> This is our country and it is our right to straighten it out <s> We didn 't tell Gration to come and solve our problems for us we will solve it by ourselves ' Al-Nur accused the GONU of signing agreements without implementing them Abdulwahid al-Nur 'Have we ever refused to sign a peace agreement with the government Earlier we went to sign a peace agreement in Abuja we and Minni and JEM <s> After that how many movements were created by the government Even if all the movements including ours sign a peace agreement and still there is no security in Darfur there will be a new rebellion - do you think that we are the only men in the region So peace is not a matter of signing papers <s> The NCP is very ready to sign any number of papers but if you go back and look at all peace agreements

March <date> Subject 'I lost my family I lost my country I may lose my life 'Dear friend Just hours have slipped past since I returned home from Sudan and the thoughts fears frustrations and hopes of Darfuris and other Sudanese swirl together in my mind <s> Traveling to Khartoum Darfur and Juba allowed me and my colleagues Jerry Fowler and Sean Brooks to see Sudan for ourselves to observe what it is like in internally displaced persons IDPs camps and collect the stories of real people and what they are experiencing day to day to improve our advocacy on behalf of the people of Sudan <s> Common themes of security aid and political freedom emerged from our travels in Darfur <s> We visited 6 different IDP camps meeting with camp leaders and IDPs <s> First and foremost IDPs named security as their number one concern <s> Many complained of being subject to violence when leaving camps not just women risking rape but both men and women being attacked when they go to the market or work in the cities <s> We often heard descriptions of the most recent attacks and that this violence was on the rise not decline <s> Despite Sudanese government claims that IDPs were returning to their villages in large numbers we found little evidence of this <s> While there may be some returns and some seasonal migration to farm IDPs said the main reason they cannot return home is because of a lack of security and in some cases because other people were occupying the land they once lived on <s> One leader sai ' <weirdcaps> we can travel for two days without being attacked we will go with no one telling us 'The source of the ongoing threat of violence is unclear <s> IDPs typically complained about Janjaweed while the government blamed rebel factions and general banditry <s> We experienced a heavy armed presence in Darfur from checkpoints and guards at buildings to 'technicals 'which are pickup trucks with a heavy machine gun and a few uniformed men on back deployed regularly in strategic locations along main routes <s> As we approached one IDP camp we saw a technical speed off through the mi 'le of the camp at a high rate of speed <s> Despite this heavy presence reports of violent attacks were prolific including carjackings of multiple UN staff we met with <s> In order not to endanger ongoing operations in light of the March 4th <date> expulsions we did not meet with any humanitarian organizations in Darfur <s> It is unfortunate we could not benefit from their collective experience but in our role as advocates we were able to personally witness a number of continuing humanitarian challenges which need to be a 'ressed <s> While distribution of food aid has been picked up by the World Food Programme and some new partners provision of adequate water supplies appeared to be more problematic exacerbated by poor rains last year <s> At one camp water was shut down at noon and hand pumps were broken <s> In multiple camps we visited people lined up for water with rows and rows of empty jugs waiting to be filled <s> We saw unsanitary conditions around some pumps where spilled water runs off and mixes with animal waste and children run around in bare feet <s> Health services also seem to have suffered following the expulsions last year <s> Medical staff said they typically treat cases of chest and eye infections malaria and diarrhea <s> A shortage of medicine including cough syrup and antibiotics and lack of access to laboratories were cited as problems <s> Also many of the programs previously in place to prevent gender-based violence and treat rape survivors have not been replaced <s> We asked IDPs what they thought about the upcoming elections <s> The overwhelming majority of IDPs said they did not register and therefore will be disenfranchised in the election <s> Some said they didn 't bother because 'we don 't have real representatives to vote for 'while others feel that free political conditions do not exist <s> The ongoing state of emergency and level of violence leave doubts about a safe environment for candidates and voters in Darfur <s> When asked whether he feared for his life one tribal leader told us 'I lost my family I lost my country I may lose my life 'But he was resolved to carry on advocating for a just and lasting peace <s> One bright spot is the desire for peace <s> A real movement for peace exists across the camps we visited <s> IDPs we talked to generally want to participate in the peace process but feel they are not being included <s> One camp leader told us 'IDPs have ideas to give 'In each camp we asked IDPs what message we could bring back to activists in America <s> Consistently we were thanked for the work of our movement to bring media attention and put pressure on world leaders to act to resolve the crisis and asked to keep fighting for justice <s> On more than one occasion we were asked to 'please press the movements for peace ' a direct call for rebel leaders to stop fighting and

and then the press gets involved and everyone is quite overwrought <s> And that is sort of the whole of it nbsp It is super <s> Cross-posted at books i done read <s> I think I liked the idea of this book more than the book itself <s> A gothic mystery horror story set in Victorian London featuring Charles Dickens and narrated by Wilkie Collins sounded like exactly the kind of book I would enjoy <s> Unfortunately it didn 't quite live up to its fascinating premise and I was left with mixed feelings about it <s> Drood is told in the form of a memoir written by Wilkie Collins a close friend and collaborator of Charles Dickens as well as being the author of The Woman in White The Moonstone and many other novels and plays and a 'ressed to an unknown reader in the future that is to us <s> The story begins with the Staplehurst Rail Disaster of <date> when the train on which Charles Dickens is travelling crashes sending most of the carriages plummeting over a viaduct into the riverbed below <s> Luckily Dickens is in one of the few carriages that doesn 't fall <s> As he helps to rescue people from the wreckage he encounters a mysterious figure dressed in a black cape who introduces himself only as 'Drood ' <s> In the days following the train crash Dickens becomes obsessed with finding Drood and discovering his true identity <s> With the reluctant help of Wilkie Collins Dickens begins a search for Drood which leads them through the dark alleys and underground catacombs of London <s> Interspersed with the Drood storyline are long passages in which we learn about the family life and living arrangements of both Dickens and Collins how much they earned for their various novels their walking tour of Cumberland in <date> the details of Wilkie is laudanum a 'iction the story of the Swiss chalet given to Dickens by his friend Charles Fechter Dickens ' interest in mesmerism and every other piece of biographical information you could possibly want to know <s> Simmons also incorporates some genuine historical letters and quotes which a is some authenticity to the book <s> I can see why some readers might find this boring but I enjoyed these sections I thought the descriptions of Dickens ' reading tours were particularly fascinating <s> Simmons has attempted to imitate Wilkie Collins ' narrative style including the Victorian habit of talking directly to the reader but I felt that he didn 't get it quite right <s> He also uses a lot of words and phrases that just sound either too modern or too American to me the real Collins or Dickens would have walked on the pavement rather than the sidewalk for example <s> This is only a small complaint though as overall Dear Reader I thought his style was quite convincing <s> I do like the way the book takes us through the process of researching and writing The Moonstone <s> However some important plot points are given away so if you haven 't already read The Moonstone and think you might want to then I would suggest you read it before you begin Drood <s> It might also be a good idea to read The Mystery of Edwin Drood first I didn 't and kept wishing I had <s> Another thing I liked about the book was the way Simmons deliberately tries to confuse and mislead the reader - at several points in the novel we are made to wonder whether something we 've just read is real or an illusion <s> This journey through the cemeteries opium dens and underground sewers of London is a good atmospheric read for a cold dark night but I was slightly disappointed by it and despite reading all <date> pages I still can 't decide whether I enjoyed it or not However it will almost certainly leave you wanting to learn more about Dickens and Collins and their works which can only be a good thing <s> If you like this type of book I would also recommend The Quincunx by Charles Palliser - another book set in Victorian England and written in a 19th century style <s> Before I come to the end of this review I would just like to say a few words in defence of poor Wilkie Collins who happens to be one of my favourite authors <s> Simmons clearly doesn 't rate Wilkie as a writer I saw an interview where he described him as amediocre ' and in Drood the character is portrayed as a not very talented second-rate author who is consumed with jealousy of the more successful Dickens and becomes increasingly bitter and unlikeable as the book goes on <s> I admit I am biased because I 've absolutely loved every Wilkie Collins book I 've read he was a much better writer than Drood suggests and definitely not mediocre at least in my opinion -Pictures of Charles Dickens top and Wilkie Collins bottom both in the public domain Helen Loves Books The Tenant of Wildfell Hall nbsp by Anne Bronte <math> pages The Tenant of Wildfell Hall is the second and last nbsp novel written by Anne Bronte in her twenty nine years <math> to <date> nbsp nbsp Last month I read and posted on her first work Agnes Grey <s> The Tenant of Wildfell Hall is told in a very interesting way nbsp nbsp It is a novel very rooted in its time and place nbsp nbsp The book is divided into three sections and each is told from a different point of view and narrated in a different fashion nbsp Part One is from the point of view of Gilbert a well off farmer nbsp A mysterious woman a widow and her son have moved into Wildfell Hall a once grand mansion nbsp nbsp Gilbert begins to court the widow Helen Graham and loses interest in the woman his mother wanted him to marry nbsp In a search for revenge this woman begins to spread gossip about Helen nbsp nbsp One needs to keep in mind that in the time and place of the novel a woman was not thought complete without a man and any single woman widow or otherwise above the age of twenty five or so was seen as a potential threat to the stability of the community and its morals nbsp nbsp A friend of Gilbert is is also seemingly courting Helen nbsp When Gilbert behaves in a jealous fashion Helen gives Gilbert her diaries to read <s> The diary reveals her abusive marriage to Arthur Huntington nbsp nbsp Helen begins the marriage completely in love nbsp Over time Arthur seems to become bored with her company and prefers to spend his time with friends from his days prior to marriage nbsp These friends lead him back into a life of heavy drinking and partying with women of dubious repute in the company of male friends nbsp He becomes abusive to her and he tries to turn her son to his ways teaching him to disrespect his mother and use improper language nbsp In a move of extreme boldness for her day Helen left Arthur nbsp nbsp There some interesting twists and turns of the plot and throughout it all Helen behaves in a near saintly fashion returning to her abusive husband to nurse him nbsp through a fatal disease <s> Part 3 begins when Helen leaves Wildfell Hall nbsp We see Anne has kept some secrets from us nbsp nbsp The ending is much like the ending of Agnes Grey nbsp I liked several things about this book nbsp I liked Anne Bronte is use of differing narrative modes for different sections of the book nbsp nbsp I enjoyed the conversations in the book a lot nbsp nbsp Wildfell Hall shows Anne was rapidly developing as an artist compared with her first work nbsp nbsp Wildfell Hall is one of the first novels showing a woman leaving an abusive husband nbsp nbsp The abusive husband is a bit of a stereotype of the times hence the name Huntington meaning he prefers the pleasure of the hunt to the company of his wife nbsp nbsp You can see how deeply Anne felt alcohol was at the root of the problems in her marriage nbsp She was very unhappy when her husband began to teach their son to drink nbsp nbsp The novel is rooted in the time as there is no longer any great mysterious stigma that attached to a single woman with a child as there was in England in the <date> s nbsp Or perhaps one should say a single woman not of the poorer and majority class of people nbsp nbsp The world of women is a small one in the novels of Anne Bronte nbsp She explores its limits very well <s> I read Wildfell Hall in part because I have decided to read all of the novels of the Bronte Sisters nbsp There are only seven of them and I like feeling closure on a reading project nbsp nbsp As I was reading I could not help but wonder if almost everyone reads her works mainly because of who her ates were nbsp <smiley> 'Ate 'is a tagalog word for 'big sister 'that conveys for me the familial relationship between Anne and her sisters nbsp nbsp A young sister or brother will call nbsp their older nbsp sibling 'Ate Jane 'and it is meant to convey respect for an elder sister nbsp nbsp Wildfell Hall is worth reading on its own nbsp nbsp Her work does not have the power depth and beauty of nbsp the work of her ates but not much does nbsp nbsp I really thing anyone into the Brontes the Victorian novel or 19th century women writers should read all of nbsp the Bronte novels nbsp nbsp Mel u The Reading Life nbsp click on poster for link to trailer Corey and I had a date night tonight to go see the new Alice in Wonderland movie <s> We saw in 3D <s> Alice is 19 years old and has dreams about the happenings of the original movies <s> My thoughts are that it was just okay <s> We will not be taking the kids to see it at the theater <s> First and foremost I think they would be bored <s> The beginning is very slow to get going and the plot would kind of be over their heads I think with her being rebellious about corsets and stockings and then attending a party that turns out to be her engagement party <s> That doesn 't ruin the plot I don 't think <s> She eventually chases after the white rabbit and falls in the rabbit hole etc etc <s> It was very much like the movies I have seen before just different looking <s> The plot is a little different but several of the same things happen but with less 'childishness 'about them <s> My conclusion is that it wasn 't serious and deep enough to make it very interesting for adults but it wasn 't childish and silly enough to make it fully appropriate for children either <s> The gruesome aspects stepping on human heads to cross a moat monster eyes being plucked out by straight pins make it just too much for little kids so then the lack of more makes it slightly too simple for adults <s> I think it should have gone one more step one way or the other <s> It does look very interesting and beautiful <s> The 3D affects are great <s> There are some really funny parts with the Red Queen when she goes on her tirades but I don 't think kids would 'get it 'The March Hare is pretty funny <s> The Mad Hatter is typical of what you would expect with Johnny Depp playing that part <s> The White Queen is whimsical <s> There is a good message of good conquering evil and the Red Queen is demise <s> I even picked up on some easy to make comparisons between the overall story characters storyline and Christianity <s> Overall if I were rating on a scale of <date> with 1 being Mystery Science Theater level and 10 being like Epic Life Changing Films <s> I would give it a 6 <s> I would watch it again maybe the story is good because the story was already good but it will be hard to find the just right age for our kids so we can watch it together as a family <s> Better versions of this movie have already been made in my opinion the Disney one is the best because it makes me laugh a lot Even though they said it is not supposed to be 'the original movie 'it kind of is <s> A good version but disappointed because it could have been so much better <s> I think the fault lies with whoever wrote the screenplay <s> This movie completes my Victorian Film Mini-Movie Challenge <s> I didn 't even realize it until I was posting on my other blog and saw the list of what I had already completed <s> Although most of this film is NOT set in the regular Victorian setting it is for part of the time and the essence is there even in Wonderland or 'Underland 'as it is called in this film <s> Ok so I read this a long time ago before I understood things like isubtlety ' and I was all What nbsp This isn 't scary nbsp Those ghosts probably aren 't even real <s> But now ACK nbsp Those ghosts probably aren 't even real <punctuationfreak> So a bunch of people are sitting around telling ghost stories over Christmas you know as one does and this one guy is all I have a story that will chill you nbsp But it is at home and I have to send for it so you can all go ahead and wait nbsp And that is how tenterhooks were born <s> The story finally arrives and he reads it and its this governess who takes a position looking after two wee chillens who are beautiful and perfect and good and innocent which is sort of freaky on its own no except that maybe they are communicating with and or possessed by some wicked ghosts nbsp Because the governess keeps seeing said ghosts who are apparently the valet and the previous governess who got knocked up by said valet and drowned herself in the lake allegedly and they appear to be trying to get the children nbsp Except that whenever the ghosts appear the children make a POINT of REALLY DELIBERATELY not seeing them even though the governess is sure they do nbsp It is pretty sinister <s> But then also maybe the children really don 't see the ghosts because there are no ghosts because the governess is going mad nbsp Because maybe they make a point of really deliberately not seeing them because they actually don 't see them because nbsp they aren 't there <punctuationfreak> nbsp And the housekeeper doesn 't seem them even when they 're right there but maybe she just doesn 't have that ability nbsp And I realize that I am not making this sound very scary and loads of people read <weirdcaps> and don 't stay up nights but few things nbsp terrify my shit more nbsp than ambiguity nbsp Except maybe sharks <s> I also feel like I should shoot you a disclaimer here and let you know that James is a mad nbsp over-commafier and no one thought to nbsp pelt him with nbsp periods so his sentences get rull long and Victorian nbsp Not like Lisa Appignanesi is do to the point where you totally lose track of where the sentence started but enough to exhaust the old temporal lobe nbsp But I find him Worth It <s> Cross-posted at books i done read <s> Montmorency is a thief <s> A common criminal doing time in one of Victorian London is notorious prison in <date> <s> But what makes him a different than many criminals is that he is very smart and that he is lucky enough to have a benefactor of sorts -- a brilliant doctor who saved his life <s> While fleeing the police after a robbery attempt Montmorency he crashed through a factory skylight and landed on an enormous machine and would have died from his injuries if an ambitious young doctor hadn 't wanted to use him as a test case <s> A year after his accident following multiple painful surgeries the thief who is known as Montmorency an alias he has adopted from the name on the bag of tools he was clutching as he fell is routinely trotted out for meetings of the Victorian scientific community <s> He is pro 'ed and poked like a laboratory animal while the upper-crusties are treating him like some kind of rare zoo exhibit Montmorency a bright young man with an excellent memory is actually studying them and storing away all sorts of useful information <s> He is not stealing valuables items any more -- just valuable ideas nbsp After one such exhibition Montmorency absorbs up a very interesting piece of information a map of the newly renovated London sewer system <s> Montmorency realizes that this would be the perfect escape route for a thief and for the rest of his incarceration he begins planning <s> He will use his burglary skills and newfound knowledge to reinvent himself as a gentleman <s> I really enjoyed this book <s> Of course I am currently fascinated by the Victorian period but this book was both well-written historical novel and an exciting adventure crime story <s> Though I personally would never have the nerve to burglarize it is fun to imagine -- I do love heist movies and crime capers so there you go <s> I think Upland did a good job imagining any plot holes and figuring out plausible explanations as to how Montmorency is able to pull off a double life as a Victorian gentleman a trick in itself and a thief that spends his nights in the slimy sewers of London without getting caught <s> He does encounter all kinds of setbacks and dangers <s> I do wish that Updale had given more details about the actual burglaries -- once it is established that he is a thief she doesn 't give many examples of the crimes just the fact that he is a burglar <s> Also she doesn 't flesh out too much of his character -- Montmorency is so busy trying to reinvent himself yet the reader learns next to nothing about his history not even his real name <s> A little more detail would have been great <s> Since this is the first in the series of four I suspect the reader will get more information in the later volumes <s> While I do recommend Montmorency I have to point out that there is extensive discussion especially in the beginning about the filth of the London sewer system and everything that is in there -- and fairly explicit descriptions of the sanitation systems of Victorian prisons <s> If you have a weak stomach you might want to skim those chapters <s> I like to read while I eat but I would not recommend this book for mealtime nbsp reading until you get past about Chapter 13 <s> It is short only <date> pages and a fast read <s> This volume of the Montmorency series is also available on audiobook narrated by the wonderful Stephen Fry aka Wooster from PBS ' Jeeves amp Wooster <s> I 've already put Monmorency Book 2 on hold at the library <s> Sadly though there are several copies of the first book in my library system which has 24 branches they only own one of each of the remaining books in the series <s> It is too bad this book isn 't more popular nbsp nbsp Maybe if all the teens read it they 'll get hooked on Victorians and we 'll have a whole new generation of lit lovers <s> This is book 4 for Our Mutual Read challenge <s> In some ways this reminds me of Suite Francaise by Irene Nemirovsky which is another instance in which the story behind a book is just as interesting as the book itself <s> My first online search for information about The Bondwoman is Narrative pulled up not information about the narrative itself but an outline of events about Henry Louis Gates Jr is discovery and analysis of the manuscript the proposed theories surrounding its authorship by Hannah Crafts a pseudonym and its journey to publication <s> Which admittedly is fascinating <s> I 'd been unsure whether to include this Virago Modern Classic in this month is reading but the story behind the story cinched the deal for me <s> As fascinating as it is however I became more interested in the story behind the story and almost forgot about the narrative itself there are about a hundred pages of text before the novel begins and the introduction is engaging but in its efforts to illuminate the various possible identities for Hannah Crafts much of the story is plot is revealed along with abundant information about the actions of the characters therein <s> I would have preferred the introduction be presented as an appendix but this is a pet peeve of mine being so spoiler-phobic and simultaneously being an orderly reader who would prefer to begin at the beginning and read straight through but the appendices are filled with their own interesting information e g detailed description of how the manuscript was authenticated so there wasn 't much room there for more I 'd guess <s> So I read about 20 pages of the Introduction and then I jumped ahead to read the novel and I jumped back to the Introduction when I had finished Hannah Craft is novel <weirdcaps> the backstory is gripping and vital contextually to a more complete understanding of The Bondwoman is Narrative so I am not actually complaining about this even if it kinda sounds that way <s> Here is the thing though forget about all the history behind it for a second <s> The Bondwoman is Narrative is a gripping tale <s> Apparently the author was heavily influenced by books like Bleak House and Jane Eyre I 've only read Jane Eyre of those two but I am not sure I would have spotted the connections although scholars have pointed out many direct similarities between TBW isN and these two texts and there are all kinds of creepy and dramatic events that pull the reader into the story <s> A hatchet with hair still stuck to the heft trees haunted by spirits still furious at their unjust treatment while alive women driven mad conniving business dealings and yes this includes the business of human trade this is not a dry historical narrative but a fantastic yarn <s> Nonetheless a yarn with considerable import <s> As potentially the first known novel written by an African American woman this novel is significant for being one of few of that time period that took the author is race as the norm <s> Unlike other narratives of that time period which were sometimes even written under pseudonyms by white women pretending to write an 'escape-from-slavery 'chronicle true abolitionists or simply opportunists who envied Harriet Beecher Stowe is incredible success with her <date> novel Uncle Tom is Cabin the black characters in The Bondwoman is Narrative are never described in stereotypical terms and the presumption is that characters are black unless otherwise described <s> This is the exception rather than the rule for manuscripts dating to this time period so it is certainly possible to read this novel for scholarly reasons but too much emphasis on its importance might discourage readers who if they just approached this as a 19th-Century Sentimental novel might just find it a good read <s> Surely a book can be both important and enjoyable <s> Anyone else read something lately that they were surprised to find themselves truly enjoying even though they might have originally chosen the book because it was culturally or historically significant I am running out of cliches to express how much Sarah Waters rocks me like a hurricane nbsp Seriously nbsp She is amazeballs nbsp When she is good she is very very good and when she is bad she is still pretty damned good nbsp Admit it The Night Watch only kind of sucked because it wasn 't Fingersmith <s> And to be fair Affinity nbsp Also not Fingersmith nbsp Ok but come on you guys nbsp SPIRIT MEDIUMS and SECRETS and spinster ladies who are recovering from the deaths of their fathers and then also something else horrible that they 're not telling you about and also VICTORIAN LADY PRISONS nbsp You would like read <s> Ok so nbsp Margaret is a spinster lady who is visiting women in prison because that is the sort of benevolent thing ladies did in those days to guide them in the ways of not being felons and also nbsp so that the benevolent ladies didn 't go stark raving mad while living at home with their mothers and being spinsters nbsp Also something horrible happened to her and no one is talking about it but everyone is mentioning it obliquely and nbsp glancing significantly at everyone else nbsp Prepare to feel out of the loop <s> But then Margaret meets Selina prisoner-slash-spirit-medium and if you are at all familiar with La Waters you will be all I SEE YOU COMING LADY ROMANCE nbsp And if you are not well you have eyes nbsp And I really want other things to have happened so that I can delineate them for you but for the rest of the novel Margaret goes to visit Selina in prison and that is sort of it for nbsp many many pages nbsp then something Fairly Unexpected happens at the end nbsp So <s> And it is awesome and atmsopheric and there may or may not be spooks nbsp Waters can toss a word salad like she was born to it nbsp I literally have nothing else to say about this novel nbsp I am going to start just putting 'ditto ' for all of my Waters reviews

<s> Tonight I took a step back in time <s> I took a dance class <s> Since the age of six I took dance classes and the dance studio became a haven for me <s> Home was confusing or frightening school

what a bunch of nonsense the whole thing was <s> And at first it did seem that way to me <s> Then a few friend requests popped up <s> Some faces I instantly recognized others sent me to my bookshelf to find my yearbooks turning pages remembering and a bit shocked that some of these people remembered me at all <s> I had felt invisible for a lot of high school and there was something revealing in knowing I was seen <s> As my friend list grew I rekindled relationships with people from my past kindergarten classmates friends of friends acquaintances I met through past jobs through travel and through the other random moments in life <s> I found children I was a nanny for in college all grown up with the same three year old grin hi 'en somewhere in their expression and magically recreated in their own to 'ler is faces <s> It became all a little bit captivating <s> No longer were all these people frozen in time <math> judging me and what I hadn 't done it startles me to think how self centered and more than a little paranoid that thinking was <s> My own fears made me believe no one could see past well the past when it was me that was stuck in time forgetting that we all step through trap doors miss our chances take new directions <s> We all do <s> And we become who we are because of it <s> Even my closest friends that I stay in constant contact with have become dearer to me <s> I do know what they are doing at any given moment when they feel like sharing and it is a gift <s> I no longer just hear from Judith through emails or the occasional call <s> I know that she just got great news or shares pictures of her son is visit from college and I get to be a part of her life again just as I did when I lived around the corner from her in Atlanta even though we now live five hours apart <s> I join in my friends ' joy as they a ' to their families and share pictures of moments I would have otherwise completely missed <s> I see us all growing up doing everything all over the map <s> And all my paranoid visions of judgment are laughable now <s> The love and support from people I once only knew from Algebra class and school field trips now encourage me before a job interview or send snarky comments to me when I need to laugh <s> My heart swells when someone is in crisis or worries in the ER for a sick child and a group of Facebook warriors from all across the globe keep thoughts and prayers flowing through message after message lighting up the screen at all hours <s> It has been a learning experience and for any naysayers about social media there is something so connected real and genuine about it all and I can honestly say it has enriched my life <s> In those small snippets of text that grace the main pages there is humor wisdom sadness and acceptance <s> And for me there has been more <s> It is how I met the person I love <s> Through careful steps shared memories and more than a little trepidation we got to know each other <s> And I am absolutely certain I would never have been able to open my heart any other way <s> Coming from a shared background knowing his past him knowing mine others knowing both of us and encouraging a romance it was the perfect formula for me to step back into the world of trust <s> And I did one status update at a time <s> I constantly search for a way to quiet my mind once it starts whirling a way to stop thinking worrying and fretting <s> At times when I feel overwhelmed I need something to escape into <s> For many years cooking has been a source of passion and comfort for me-- a way to sink into something else and change my focus <s> Having been single for more years than I would like to count it has too often seemed a waste or at times too costly to do the kind of cooking I like to do <s> Nothing makes me happier than a crowd to cook for <s> I love all of it the planning choosing recipes finding out who likes what and then the shopping preparation and unveiling the finished product <s> To me it is sharing love giving of myself and I enjoy so much watching others enjoy a good meal and the camaraderie and laughter that accompany it <s> I never questioned whether or not I would be able to cook it was something I saw my mother and my grandmother instinctively do with rarely a cookbook or recipe card in sight <s> I assumed it was a learned behavior like reading or riding a bike <s> I do believe that part of that mentality is from a southern upbringing <s> At least from my mother is point of view it seemed expected for a woman to be a good cook it was all part of getting and keeping a husband <s> But for all of the backwards and sometimes time-warped southern traditions I am thankful that learning to cook--feeling the need to cook is in my DNA <s> In my grandmother is tiny mountain cabin which lacked a full plumbing system and barely enough room for all of us to stand- let alone sit- in her house she created aromas I am not sure have been replicated to date even though my mother holds many of the recipes <s> Her gravy and biscuits still makes me ache for Sunday mornings and even though I have watched my mother countless times and have made more attempts than I care to mention I can 't make them taste the same <s> Because my mother grew up very poor my grandmother is cooking skills were put even more to the test trying to stretch a thin budget to feed five children <s> Even still my mother recalls my grandmother is dishes with great admiration and nostalgia and these same dishes have graced our table over the years <s> And while growing up things in my house were strained tough and at times incredibly unhappy some of the few peaceful times we shared as our disconnected silhouette of a family were around the dinner table <s> Looking back it was almost as if when the kitchen timer sounded all the chaos took a time out for dinner <s> My mother was and has always been an excellent cook and many nights out of the week we sat down to a great meal <s> There is a calming effect with food the anticipation savoring the focus <s> In the midst of the end of a workday an argument or just a swirl of activity everything has to slow down at least somewhat <s> For me cooking was always a little for daydreaming too <s> I always imagined honing my skills and how I would one day be a wife and mother preparing meals for my family my fresh start to heal and begin anew <s> Over the years as that seemed further from reality I still took comfort in cooking for my friends coworkers and my surrogate family members throughout all the cities I lived in <s> And so many times when I was concentrating on the dreams that I didn 't see coming true I didn 't realize that in many of my closest friend is houses the kitchen brought me a sense of family <s> I think of Judith is kitchen in Atlanta sharing so many meals in her home the back of the house awash with light over early dinners of amom is special dish ' her son is favorite <s> I think of 'Nanny Rice ' made with so much love in Debby is kitchen in NC that I grew up associating it with comfort and her heart for me <s> I think of cooking meals at Patrick and Kristin is house for friends and for their little girls remembering when they still sat in booster seats giggling at me from across the table <s> And in just the last few weeks my best friend Kim and I have shared and made each other is recipes more than once <s> She is my teacher as of late and I love knowing I have her expertise at any moment <s> As I made a pot of homemade soup tonight at the end of a stressful day after too many worries about money work and tough decisions- I found myself slowing down as I chopped and sliced sauted and stirred <s> And a little bit of each of those kitchens from my grandmother is to Judith is to Debby is and finally my own-- helped me ease my mind and feel a sense of comfort and family <s> And there is nothing more delicious than that <s> There are times when nbsp I spend hours on a blog post sorting through all my thoughts and sentences wearing the pages of my thesaurus thin not able to connect the exact meaning with my keystrokes <s> I always have a feeling of accomplishment when I am done--believing at least that I have gotten as close as I can <s> Sometimes the words resonate with readers and sometimes they don 't but I know I said what I wanted or needed to say <s> Then there are times when the words flow when I can 't get them down fast enough it is almost stressful to write at a quick enough pace before I forget where my mind is heading <s> More often than not these writing bursts happen late at night or early in the morning <math> as my nightowl tendencies lend me to greater creative connectivity past the hours of midnight <s> And many times those streaming thoughts are the ones that seem to connect--I know there is more of a purity there <s> My last post No Other Way nbsp was one of those entries <s> I wrote it from beginning to end in a matter of minutes and got some comments and emails so touching in response that I was teary-eyed <s> I even printed a few out for inspiration <s> But mainly I was so heartened <s> I know that I have battled some of the darkest bouts of depression a person could ever go through and have experienced so much seemingly bad luck in my life that nbsp my friends often commented to me that it seemed at times like a black cloud followed me <s> When in those midnight-black places I didn 't want to hear from anyone that things could get better <s> It seemed like empty words coming from people who could not possible understand my pain or the sheer impossibility of getting to the other side <s> And then every now and then I would read an article a story an essay or a blog post and someone is words would reach me <s> I would see shared circumstances and find something that gave me a glimmer <s> Or as in the case of Matt Logelin is blog I would read about someone in completely different circumstances but whose strength and grace just made me believe nbsp that I too could keep going nbsp Those moments could sustain me for long periods of time <s> So often when I share something of my life the responses and stories I get in return from readers blow me away <s> The grace survival humor and ability to put it all into words is so touching and beautiful and we all never really recognize how amazing our own stories are <s> And although my life is far from perfect I do know that I would never ever have believed all the amazing things that have happened to me in the last year <s> Two years ago I was so far away from all this--and if you are reading this--and if you need these words--please read them and know them to be true <s> Even from the bottom of a seemingless bottomless pit everything can change <s> Everything <s> It may not all be perfect but it can be happy and hopeful and more than you thought possible <s> It can <s> I promise <s> And for so many of us creative souls writing is therapy healing and sanity <s> Write-- put it all down <s> It doesn 't have to be poetic <s> Even when I look back on some of my most heartbreaking journal entries or blog posts I am so thankful I have those words--laced with all that pain <s> Because looking back I know how far I have come how little hope I had and how nothing is ever written in stone <s> And for anyone else who has come out of these dark places whatever they may be someone out there needs to hear your words of survival and hope <s> So share trust yourself <s> It may make all the difference <s> It did for me <s> I am thankful- for decisions I didn 't get to make dreams that fell through- love lost <s> I am thankful- for all the things that went wrong <s> The turns in my life that cut me to pieces- the long journey back to making myself whole <s> I am thankful- for almost falling into the abyss Being pulled back against my will- almost angry that I survived <s> I am thankful that I couldn 't imagine such happiness because it is sweeter now that I doubted it with such intensity <s> It is easy to be thankful for beauty <s> Who would have ever thought I would be so thankful for the very worst things The missed chances defeat dark places I dare not revisit <s> The outcomes I fought with all my might to change- to bend- to make what I thought I needed <s> But nothing worked <s> I lost those battles over and over <s> For that I am most thankful <s> There was no other way <s> I know that now <s> I found myself again <s> It is been a long time <s> I am here <s> Right where I am supposed to be <s>

upset about something <s> While she chattered on about the weather or her recent purchase of new placemats for the kitchen she was trying to find the courage to say what was really on her mind <s> Finally in a quiet voice almost a whisper she said You didn 't send us a card for our anniversary <s> We have been married for fifty years this was special <s> I was just surprised <s> Fifty years <s> I knew when their anniversary was <s> My mother has never been subtle or able to hold back excitement for any holiday or birthday <s> She is nearly unbearable around Christmastime walking around in holiday sweaters that embarrassed me growing up and even now <s> So for the weeks leading up to their anniversary date she was dropping hints and asking for my advice on a present for my father all the time reminding me of the approaching day <s> I should be a bigger person <s> It is one day out of the year <s> I could drop a card in the mail with some simple sentiment nothing too sappy nbsp devoid of anything nbsp that makes me sound overjoyed about the occasion <s> I could send flowers and just sign the card with my name <s> But I never have been able to make myself do it <s> My parents both grew up in poverty in an area of Kentucky that is still a bit lost in time <s> At that time in that place it wasn 't uncommon for people to marry young <s> My mother was sixteen when they married my father was twenty <s> From day one and not just because of her age my mother has been dependent on my father <s> She is and has always been painfully shy and doubts everything about herself with such depth that I am shocked when she steps even a millimeter outside of her comfort zone <s> She didn 't have a driver is license until the age of 29 and this was after years of marriage and success nbsp with my father is career and after having two children <s> They had money for her to have a car <s> Instead she waited for my father to take her where she needed to go <s> Their marriage showed no evidence of love or respect at any moment since I can remember-- since I knew even a little about what those words meant <s> My mother has always professed her love for my father <s> I know she believes that and means it <s> But how you can truly love someone who has never put you first has never encouraged you or believed in you who has belittled you taken you for granted ignored your birthdays squashed your dreams and expected in turn to be waited on hand and foot is beyond comprehension for me <s> She was a child when she married him <s> He taught her his version of love and she was an excellent student <s> Fifty years of marriage for my parents to me is not a cause for celebration or special recognition <s> If I have to label it I would say it is an accomplishment at best <s> My mother survived fifty years of never making a decision without deferring to my father <s> She managed to put a face on for the world that seemed together and content when my father is alcoholism and many affairs were the crippling reality <s> I can 't paint her completely as a hero or even a martyr-- as she lived in such denial over the toll my father is choices and behavior were taking on our family <s> She chose indifference over action <s> She chose denial over protecting me <s> For the forty years I have lived with or known my parents their marriage has confused me sa 'ened me angered me <s> When I was very young caught up in my mother is excitement of marking special days on the calendar I would make homemade cards for their anniversaries out of construction paper and glitter happily handing it to them on the morning of the big day <s> But even when I was barely out of grade school celebrating that day felt false <s> Not marking that day with some gesture wasn 't done out of bitterness it just seemed so much like a lie a betrayal of everything I knew to be true <s> I couldn 't make myself encourage my mother is state of denial <s> I feel for her <s> I hurt for her <s> I wonder so often what my mother could have become what she would have done with her life had she not married my father or had she broken away from him when she was young <s> I sometimes imagine her with someone who would have seen her <s> Truly seen the person she is the heart she has <s> She can 't even see it herself <s> So each year I let that day in February quietly pass <s> The square box stares back at me on the calendar <s> I don 't have to mark it I know the date <s> It is the date that made my mother who she is and me who I am <s> It was the beginning and the end for all of us <s> It is the loss of her innocence the beginning of his betrayals <s> It is a mix of love and hate <s> It is a contradiction wishing the union didn 't happen but knowing I would not be here if it hadn 't <s> And there isn 't a card for that

<s> Statistics are like bikinis <s> What they reveal is suggestive but what they conceal is vital - Aaron Levenstein The NSF has finally ended the suspense <s> I got the fellowship <punctuationfreak>

from 5 00PM ET until 12 00AM ET on Monday April 6 for scheduled maintenance 'Maybe this could this be an indicator that they 're uploading the awardee information <s> Or am I just being hypervigilant Last year the winners of the grant were posted on the 1st so I have been in a state of constant anxiety waiting for the announcement this year <s> I should have taken it for granted no pun intended I promise that the year I apply will be the one in which everything is delayed but maybe the maintenance message is a cryptic light at the end of the tunnel We shall see tomorrow <s> I am putting together the <weirdcaps> version of my honors thesis to present at our undergrad research forum next week and so am scrounging Google images for maned wolf pictures <s> They have miserable reproductive success in captivity details in the thesis so there aren 't too many pictures of pups but this one absolutely melted my heart and I have to share Poor kid looks like he already knows his

I applied to about five schools visited three and am now down to deciding between my top two choices <s> As with everything else in the country these days finances and funding issues are unfairly large factors as well <s> I applied for the NSF is Graduate Research Fellowship grant back in November and after months and months of patient waiting notification season is upon us <s> Awardees are supposed to be receiving their letters over the next week or so <s> I have been putting the little red flag up on my mailbox every day even though I have no outgoing mail just so I can tell at a glance when the mail has been delivered <s> But even when I see the mail has been delivered I wait all afternoon and make myself complete the day is list of work and writing goals before actually checking it just in case the letter has come because I know that once I recieve the news for better or for worse I 'll be too worked up to accomplish anything for the rest of the day <s> At this point I am not even really having anxiety over the fellowship itself the main concern is that this award pretty much determines which school I 'll be attending in the fall <s> I would like to know already But I am stuck in neutral as far as decision-making until I get word on the GRF <s> So that is the current status on my quest to become a graduate student <s> I have found a really great job for the summer but am holding off on blogging about it until it is <date> certain still waiting for all the paperwork to go through <s> Pondering Pikaia has been neglected recently I intend to be a better updater in the near future <s> In case you missed the announcement earlier this year science news and research blogging has moved to Endless Forms over at the Nature Network and <smiley> is going to be more of a chronicle of my hopefully continuing progress through the world of academia <s> Meanwhile is anyone else awaiting notification about the GRF Any stories about the experience from people who have applied in the past So yesterday Bora and I had fun joking about what Charles Darwin would have been like on Twitter <s> We came up with some hypothetical yet reasonable ideas Me arwallace Damn and Bora rowen next time I 'll block you Today I thought of a couple more agassiz i can has barnacles huxley down boy drgully i 'd like to see you try the wet wrap for a change - So in honor of Darwin Day on Thursday I thought it would be fun to solicit more ideas make up your own Darwin tweets and post them in the comments Remember Tweets must be <date> characters or less Note Someone has actually created Twitter accounts for both Darwin and Wallace but they haven 't been too active as of yet and I trust the creativity absurdity of Pondering Pikaia readers to get the creative juices flowing <s> EDIT it has come to my attention that there are two accounts for Darwin the one I originally found was charles_darwin but cdarwin is a good one active and informative too -Dr <s> Gully was the physician at Malvern a medical resort where Darwin frequently sought treatment for his various infirmities and ailments <s> The treatments were decidedly unconventional involving exposure to cold showers being wrapped in cold wet sheets etc etc <s> I thought that last year is <weirdcaps> conference was great but this year has had even more sessions more people and more fascinating topics I got a huge kick out of Henry Gee is summary in poetry form <s> I missed the evening banquet tonight because of a slight emergency back home that I needed to handle but the day was jam-packed with tons of blog goodness <s> I haven 't been liveblogging but I do have a review of the talks I attended today First up Blog-To-Book moderated by Dave Munger and Tom Levenson <s> Dave and Tom told us about the role that blogging has played in their experiences with writing print books and we discussed various issues involved in writing for books vs blogs <s> Some of the items mentioned were adjusting for a different audience changing the structure from reporting to truly telling a structured story and some discussion of why some bloggers want to try writing books <s> Is it because we feel our writing isn 't truly legitimized by blogging is it for fame and fortune was it the writing goal even pre-blog Does blogging help a writer to narrow down their interests for the book or is it a diversion of time and effort Someone can 't remember who sorry drew the analogy that a blog entry is to a book what a <weirdcaps> video is to a feature film <s> Overall a very interesting discussion <s> Next Transitions Changing Your Online Persona as Your Real Life Changes moderated by <weirdcaps> and <weirdcaps> <s> I was very interested in this one as I am approaching graduate school and contemplating how the transition between schools advisors and projects will affect my blogging <s> There was lots of good discussion about pros and cons to being anonymous how to maintain an online presence without detriment to family career and other related topics <s> Some issues of the difference between the experience of men vs women were given a lot of time as were the generational overhaul that seems to be slowly coming around as newer professors can seem to be more comfortable with the idea of blogging than older advisors <s> My last session of the morning was Teaching College Science Blogs and Beyond moderated by Andrea Novicki and Brian Switek <s> I am currently a UTA for freshman Honors Organismal Biology and hope to attain a faculty position some day so I made sure to attend this one <s> There were many ideas presented on the advantages and challenges to using blogs in college classrooms <s> They can be great ways to engage reluctant learners or students who are more comfortable expressing themselves in writing than speaking up in class <s> Also it is a great way to present supplemental material and encourage students to delve into the subject matter further in a less regimented more exploratory way <s> It could become unwieldy for large classes though and there are also privacy issues <s> Overall however the ideas for innovative strategies and beneficial results were very encouraging <s> After lunch came the session in which I was a panelist Blogging Adventure How to Post from Strange Locations <s> The other panelists were Kevin Zelnio Rick <weirdcaps> Meredith Barrett Talia Page Karen James and Vanessa Woods <s> We started off with an interactive simulation of blogging in the field complete with flashing lights pinching bugs and pen-stealing anglerfish <s> If the whole blogging thing falls through we should set up an amusement park <s> Then we all shared our stories of blogging from the field and talked about technical challenges time constraints and other obstacles to updating from remote areas <s> We also talked about why blogging from the field is important it helps to maintain a connection to the outside world and update family and friends gets people interested in science and provides a social context for scientific research <s> I currently have a proposal under review for my master is thesis but if it comes through I will have a brand new adventure blogging opportunity in the coming year stay tuned Finally I attended How to Become a Paid Science Journalist Advice for Bloggers moderated by Tom Levenson and Rebecca Skloot <s> This included lots of great advice on how to pitch ideas to magazines the importance of remaining aware that editors will judge your writing from any and all of your blog posts etc <s> So that was my day Keep in mind that there are four concurrent session in each time slot at this conference so there is much more going on than one person can relate Keep an eye on Bora is blog aggregations of the conference updates of writers from all across the science blogosphere <s> I have had a great time but tomorrow I am fleeing these arctic temperatures and heading back to Alabama <s> I 've had a great time meeting and trading ideas with so many people this weekend and I am already looking forward to the <date> conference This morning I rode the arctic blast northwards and I am here in Raleigh <s> I took a look around NC State earlier today I am currently on the hunt for grad schools but my main purpose for being here is the <weirdcaps> <date> blog conference I had a fantastic time last year and am looking forward to even more interesting sessions and people this time around <s> I will be on the panel for the Blogging Adventure How to Post from Strange Locations session tomorrow Saturday at 4 30 where we will discuss issues involved in blogging from remote locations while doing field research <s> If anyone else on NN or any other science blog network is in town for the conference keep an eye out for me Cross-posted to EF

quot wide strips leaving about 1 quot space in between the strips <s> Sprinkle half the confectioner is sugar over the ladyfingers and wait for 5 minutes <s> The sugar will pearl or look wet and glisten <s> Now sprinkle the remaining sugar <s> This helps to give the ladyfingers their characteristic crispness <s> Hold the parchment paper in place with your thumb and lift one side of the baking sheet and gently tap it on the work surface to remove excess sprinkled sugar <s> Bake the ladyfingers for 10 minutes then rotate the sheets and bake for another 5 minutes or so until the puff up turn

Boring Since your graham crackers are not store-bought they don 't have to be square <s> Use your cookie cutters to make them any shape you want Prick each square a few times with the tines of a fork I did this because those little pricks do make them look like graham crackers whatever shape they are Using a spatula place the sections of scored cracker dough on an ungreased cookie sheet I didn 't have to do this since I rolled right on the cookie sheet Bake on the first side for 8 minutes then turn the cracker over and bake for another 6 or 7 minutes Cheryl of Free Range Living said that she

is more difficult to su 'enly disagree reposition oneself from the outside or challenge the record <s> Visual diagrams lend permanence to thoughts and help to establish universal structural arrangements organizing all intellectual manifestations <s> Visual diagrams are also particularly useful for ability to pan out <s> In a text document it is often hard to get an overview without relying on an arbitrary abstraction like a table of contents <s> When reading a map however the scholar bends over to see more clearly the detail around a particular city or steps back to see the nation as a whole <s> Just so a visual diagram of an argument allows the reader to very quickly slip between the finite details and the big picture -- making sure that the argument fits exactly where it is supposed to <s> For both of these reasons I 've found as a scholar who produces text that visual diagramming aids both my ability to recall large numbers of facts -- and to organize them into a larger picture without repeating myself <s> There is much to be said here but I 'll confine myself to mentioning two of my favorite tools and their uses 1 <weirdcaps> Key uses - Notetaking at conferences lectures when facts may be needed for later recall - Organizing facts related to an overview of a broader field - Brainstorming in a relatively new subject area - Keeping track of large numbers of dates characters and places when these items are new <weirdcaps> is a sovereign organizer of images notes and web links -- it allows you to drag and drop URL is jpg is and text from your daily reading program into a map <s> A few keystrokes allow you to type 'thoughts 'quickly linking 'up 'to 'parent thoughts '-- overarching categories History of Chicago lt History of Cities -- and 'down 'to 'child thoughts ' History of Chicago gt Ship and Sanitary Canal <s> <weirdcaps> is amazing at making million-thought outlines at conferences <s> Using it to take notes allows you to over time create an extended map of your entire knowledge of things-people-have-told-you-about-the-periphery-of-your-field <s> Say I am listening to presentations at the Anglo-American Conference and one of them includes a colleague lecturing on balloon housing in the history of Chicago <s> When I begin taking notes on 'Balloon Housing 'I link it to the 'History of Chicago ' <weirdcaps> remembers that I have other notes on the History of Chicago and su 'enly my two sets of ideas are connected <s> Everything the colleague now tells me about housing and construction is now linked however distantly to

allows you to take notes on a project and move them around in a 3d map until they make sense <s> Because the essay view is synoptic the writer is eye can constantly move back up the tree hierarchy -- to make sure that this thought is in the right place -- and down the tree hierarchy -- to make sure that every statement is thoroughly supported with adequate evidence <s> The essay is written as a branching tree <s> Each sentence and paragraph can be dragged-and-dropped into place entire sections can be rearranged with their entire structure intact into the linear flow of the essay <s> In this way the essay is structure is constantly being reorganized for clearer flow <s> The writer has the ability to easily zoom in and out of a particular view <s> As one zooms out viewing the entire essay as a map blank spaces of insufficient support become visually clear <s> That ability alone decreases the chances of convincing oneself that one has adequately supported a point only to remember when printing the essay out that insufficient evidence has been cited <s> Such tools increase the writer is chances of catching redundancies early and decrease the likelihood of writing and rewriting the same essay over and over again <s> A few weeks ' work suggests that Mindmanager doubles the writing speed of an average essay at least <s> Once the thoughts are organized in what seems to be their proper shape sufficiently elaborated the writer exports to a text document <s> The visual hierarchical mindmap instantly becomes a linear essay <s> However <weirdcaps> doesn 't allow you to make the million-point 3d map of your own brain <s> It is marvelous for moving from a visual brainstorming diagram of main points down to support it is less good at creating permanent ideas in a branching tree of knowledge giving large ideas permanence and making connections where none previously existed <s> For brilliant note-taking at conferences where people are throwing you information you might need to find again in 5 years -- much better to use Personal Brain <s> For my own purposes I 've chosen to adopt both tools for different uses <s> I use <weirdcaps> for taking notes in other people is

with the words 'crumbling cities 'or 'decaying cities 'or 'ghost cities 'or 'ghost towns 'Where were they first noted these cases of urban decay -- in Scotland in California on the fringes of empire I

History of Science Society was filmed at the Detroit Book Depository <s> From <date> when Melanie Klein published her psychological studies of children playing in sandboxes to <date> when the first studies of place cells were published the primary field of new research in the mental processing of the landscape was child psychology <s> Piaget and Donald Winnicott claimed claimed to study the 'infant is point of view ' Piaget observed children drawing objects and discerned the lack of a sense of a Cartesian grid in their mental worlds things that were emotionally near were reached for as if physically near <s> The psychoanalyst Edith Cobb embarking on a long-term study of childhood experience identified a formative period between five and twelve when most of a child is energy was directed not towards parents or friendships but rather towards place <s> At this age she wrote 'the natural world is experienced in some highly evocative way producing in the child a sense of some profound continuity with natural processes and presenting overt evidence of a biological basis of intuition ' Play for the infant Winnicott argued happened in a space with neither 'inner psychic reality ' nor 'external reality ' He describes a dialectic between merging with mother and separation that is reduplicated with every nonliving object around the child in particular blankets te 'y-bears or other cherished objects that the child can alternately caress and attack treating one moment as the human extension of her own body and the next as an insensate object its button eyes to be torn out <s> The sense of self and otherness is therefore gradually formed in the 'potential space between the individual and the environment ' The environment becomes thus infested with creative play that invests all objects in the immediate landscape with valuation extrapolation and association <s> Cobb showed children Rorschach tests and watched them play in sand boxes <s> She observed with fascination how the children seemed to express emotional attachment in play with objects more vividly than with people or animals 'I became acutely aware that what a child wanted to do most of all ' she wrote 'was to make a world in which to find a place to discover a self ' Winnicott defined two different kinds of childhood learning about the environment the first 'favourable ' outcome happens an abundance of individual symbols and fascinations projected onto the environment 'the potential space becomes filled with the products of the baby is own creative imagination ' The landscape where childhood play is allowed becomes isacred to the individual ' as the place where she 'experiences creative living ' This is the world of play characterized by a sense of wonder free enjoyment and easy association that Winnicott lauds as giving children a sense of the fullness of their own potential and the many riches of experience <s> It takes the form of turning any landscape into a magical wonderland invested with the potential of encountering fairies or taking adventure <s> The second outcome Winnicott argued would happen in cases of 'failure of environmental reliability ' when a baby absorbs adults ' perspectives on the environment <s> This form of learning teaches the child about zones of danger and safety but discourages play and so Winnicott concludes is less consistent with the individual development of an internal life of the ability to critique authority or of risk-taking behavior outside <s> Individual imagination in safe childhood exploration of landscape was thus set up against collective order of the environment and the manufacture of a disciplined uncritical subject <s> Most adults Winnicott argues have experience of both playspace and discipline <s> Mature adults can return to access their mental worlds of play the space of 'unintegration ' which he defines as a 'day-dream-like ' state where fantasy dream and real world meet inner projections applied and then separated from real-world objects the limits of self and other readjusted <s> Only by relating to the landscape he thought did children have the opportunity of distinguishing themselves as

<s> In class today we were discussing an article which brought up the topic of 'Reinforcement or Motivation 'Of course it was in relation to what extent we as Speech-language clinicians should reinforce good behaviour in our child clients or whether we should let intrinsic motivation guide their behavior <s> We defined reinforcement as anything external to the child such as giving stickers and motivation being the child is own reasons for learning <s> In one study there was a group of children were told that they would be given a prize when they finished a drawing activity there was another group of kids that didn 't know they would get a reward until the end of the activity and one group who received no prize at all <s> The study showed that the children initially told that they would receive a prize for their drawing were drawing less in the classroom afterwards and that drawing became an instrumental means to receive an award <s> Overall these types of studies have shown that 'rewards have a significant negative effect on intrinsic motivation 'I got to thinking about this and its application to my experiences with choral music and I feel that my intrinsic motivation to sing is really what drives my passion <s> I always find that whenever I am offered money to sing my relationship with the music changes <s> It no longer is a passion for me since performing the music is just another job <s> Of course I would be lying to say I didn 't enjoy the fact that I get paid for gigs occasionally however I can 't honestly say that my most musically fulfilling experiences occurred when I was paid to sing <s> I understand that performing is part of an artists ' livelihood but do we ever reach a point where we are just doing another job and we 're not being musically satisfied anymore I know many musicians are possibly reading this and I would love to get their input on this matter <s> Therefore dear readers what are your thoughts Does internal motivation guide your happiness or do you feel like monetary reinforcement plays a role in shaping your happiness response as well It doesn 't even have to be choral or music related since I find this is a topic applicable to all areas <s> I 'd love to hear your thoughts in the comments section below Greetings I must say that last night is Broadway Gala was extremely fun and definitely the least stressful Gala I have ever experienced <s> I think it was due in part to the fact that Belle Canto didn 't have too many numbers so I wasn 't doing rapid-fire costume changes in the wings of the stage and I actually had time to just hang out in the green room and watch the other performances <s> However it did feel strange to be so idle when there was still so much backstage chaos going on <s> The first half of the evening were song selections revolving around the theme of 'Family 'from Seven Brides for Seven Brothers The Sound of Music Gypsy Anne of Green Gables White Christmas and Cinderella and the second half were songs from The Fi 'ler on the Roof <s> I have to get it out now I must say a special thanks for the amazing men is chorus this year It is staggering to think that these men return year after year to help us out with the Broadway Gala given the amount of work they have to go through every year <s> They definitely had a lot of work in store for them this year with the male chorus demands in Seven Brides for Seven Brothers and Fi 'ler on the Roof <s> You may wonder how a treble-centric choral program manages to find men but it is all through the connections of our choristers <s> Fathers husbands brothers friends random strangers <math> these men comprise our male chorus <s> The only unfortunate thing this year was that Belle Canto and the Men is Chorus didn 't have any duet numbers since I only have fond memories of knocking on coconut bras of the men from last year is South Pacific <s> I watched the first half of the concert from the Green Room t v so it was hard for me to hear exactly everything that was going on but it seemed like everything appeared to run smoothly <s> The 'Goin ' Courtin isong from Seven Brides for Seven Brothers was extremely cute when 2 Belle Canto lasses were showing the proper courting ways for the socially unrefined brothers <s> There was a point where each of the men took turns two-stepping with the gals and it was hilarious to watch their purposefully off-beat dance steps as they tossed the ladies around <s> The numbers from Anne of Green Gables Cinderella and Gypsy were mainly small group or solo numbers and they all were carried off wonderfully from soloists from the choir <s> I do have to say and I am not alone in this that the highlight of the first half was definitely the songs from the Sound of Music and specifically the lovely little Mia playing Gretel in 'So Long Farewell 'The unphased little Mia sat in the mi 'le of the stage all by herself and sang the solo line with confidence and charm <s> I watched from the backstage t v is and my friend Nicole put it very well in saying that the performance was so gutwrenchingly cute that her ovaries felt it <s> The second half with Fi 'ler on the Roof brought all the choirs on stage for the mass numbers and I must admit I was winging it for a few of the pieces <s> Due to the fact that I was in Montreal for most of the week and missed out on 3 of the large rehearsals I was definitely lagging behind in choreography precision <s> I knew my steps for the solo Belle Canto numbers such as for 'Sister is 'and 'The Dream 'from Fi 'ler but everything else was new to me <s> I appreciated the help of my fellow choristers tweaking my movements in Fi 'ler during the dress rehearsal which was right before the performance and I just watched others for the cues in Sabbath Prayer Anatevka and Sunrise Sunset <s> Also thanks to Amy from Belle Canto for gathering up some Belle is to run through 'Sisters 'with me backstage <s> Sure it wasn 't my best Broadway Gala performance to date but I had fun and I know my slight mishaps didn 't ruin the show <s> The most challenging was 'The Dream 'and it wasn 't due to the fact that I didn 't know what I was doing movement-wise but lining up words with an improvised piano part was not easy <s> Especially when we needed to get notes from piano <s> However I am not here to dwell on the negative <s> It was an extremely fun performance overall and I must give kudos to Steven who played Tevye for many of the Fi 'ler songs <s> Maybe it just worked out that he is the husband of our choir conductor but we managed to maximize on his talent in the past few years <s> He played the she-male Edna from Hairspray last year and his comedic flaire for Tevye was spot on this year <s> Plus it makes me smile to think of how he is a Geology academic by day but a community Broadway star by night <smiley> Overall our 9th Broadway Gala was a success in my eyes minus some small missteps missed notes and funky piano improv on some of the songs <s> It is a bit of a chaotic production every year but I wouldn 't have it any other way <smiley> Enjoy some of the pictures from the evening The men is chorus in Fi 'ler on the Roof Photo Credit Stephen L <s> Chamber Choir singing Do-Re-Mi from The Sound of Music Photo Credit Stephen L <s> Touching up makeup backstage An array of costumes from the evening Relaxing in the Green Room A cozy self-portrait My dress for the sisters number <s> I originally brought a black dress since I wasn 't sure on what the costume verdit was as I kept on getting continuous e-mails from people changing their mind while I was away in Montreal but I noticed that lots of people had color dresses on during the dress rehearsal <s> Due to the fact that our choreographer Adam said he was more focused on looking at people is dresses I figured another black dress wasn 't the most simulating so I called my mom to bring this dress that has been sitting in my closet for a while <s> Sometimes I feel sorry for my pretty clothing pieces that never get to be worn so I am glad this dress was able to have a night out <s> I believed it all worked out well and you can probably tell from the first photo in this post that the color pops a lot better than black <s> Matching sister is dresses worn by actual sisters in the choir Photo Credit Amy B Belles classy in black for our sisters numbers <s> Photo Credit Amy B All of Belle Canto on stage performing Sisters Photo Credit Stephen L <s> My last day in Montreal was definitely less action-packed but just as much fun <s> I met Leanne at the <weirdcaps> Schulich School of Music around noon after her morning practising <s> We headed off to Simons yet again for some shopping but then ended over in the hip Plateau area on St <s> Laurent street for lunch <s> At the advice of Jeremy we went over to Cafe Santropol for their delicious sandwiches <s> In my mind I was expecting a bakery-like place that served sandwiches on the side but the exter ior of this restaurant looked like an ordinary house <s> Indeed inside the restaurant was a home-turned-restaurant and we grabbed a table in the sun-room at the back of the house <s> There was a cute patio outside which I can only imagine is very lovely in the summertime <s> The sandwiches were made on their signature Cafe Santropol bread and Leanne postulated that molasses was the secret ingredient to give the bread its rich color <s> There were so many delicious sandwich options but I ended up settling on one with smoked ham with apple and mint jelly <s> It was so refreshing and light I can 't wait to go back next time and try their other inventive sandwich options <s> After lunch we did some vintage shopping on St <s> Laurent and one of the highlights was walking into a store where the sales girl looked like she walked out of the 50s era with her red lips jet-black tied back into a chic roll thick-framed glasses and vibrant cropped sweater <s> The store was full of hi 'en gems with showcases full of cat-rimmed glasses shelves with evening clutches from the <date> s and hanging displays of vintage brass broaches <s> I appreciated the fact that this vintage store was extremely non-junky since it is no fun to go vintage shopping and you 're sniffling because everything is dusty and old <s> It started snowing and getting chilly near the end of our shopping trip so we headed back to Leanne is place to start on dinner for the evening <s> She made a delicious vegetarian casserole and baked vegan chocolate brownies for dessert <s> Again we topped off the evening by viewing multiple episodes of GLEE as well as watching the Olympics men is hockey shootout between Canada and Sweden <s> Exciting times Now I am back in Edmonton and getting myself organized for the Cantilon Broadway Gala I 'll be performing at tomorrow <s> If you 're in the Edmonton St <s> Albert area you should come check out the show Location Arden Theatre St <s> Albert AB Time 7 30 pm Tickets 30 Adult 15 Student I fear this blog is venturing far away from the realm of choral music oh well I am taking a break from school so the subject matter is taking a break from choral singing as well <s> Today Leanne and I headed off to try lunch at The Sparrow <s> If I thought Reservoir was amazing yesterday the Sparrow is equal if not better <s> I was assured everything on the menu was delicious and it was <s> The restaurant is run by a chef who worked under Gordon Ramsay in London and the Sparrow embraces 'gastropub 'food <s> Thus uniting liquor and delicious eats to go along with it <s> I also heard they have a killer brunch too bad I am not here until the weekend The restaurant design was also quaint and cute with a lovely sparrow patterned wallpaper on one side of the restaurant <s> Afterward Leanne and I ventured off to find Fairmont Bagels where she picked up many delicious hand-rolled bagels <s> We walked down St <s> Denis and did some shopping and when we parted ways where she headed off to rehearsal I took a break from walking in the cold and went to go get some hot chocolate at Juliette et Chocolat <s> I remember last time I visited Juliette et Chocolat I had a bit too much chocolate and had an intense sugar buzz afterwards <s> This is because their hot chocolate isn 't some watered-down powder mix <s> You 're drinking actual melted chocolate mixed with cream <s> This time I didn 't overdose and the experience was much more enjoyable <s> I just sat there drinking liquid chocolate gold and eating a sundae topped with brownies strawberries bananas and chocolate fondue sauce while reading the online news from my cell phone <s> After this I did some more shopping in the area before meeting back up with Leanne after her Contemporary Music Ensemble rehearsal at <weirdcaps> <s> Leanne was famished so we went to find La Banquise for some delicious Montreal poutine <s> This restaurant is 24h and I have fond memories of its greasy and satisfying dishes <s> My friend and I searched for this restaurant by walking uphill on icy streets with killer windchill and I remember the sweet warm smell of victory when the aroma of freshly fried food was in the air <s> La Banquise was a greasy comfort-food haven for us and it has not changed <s> I opted for the Poutine Dan Dan this time where crispy fries were topped off with pepperoni bacon onions and cheese all smothered in gravy <s> Greasy heart-attack inducing food never tasted so good We headed back to her apartment and enjoyed viewing 'Chickasaw 'a musical <smiley> gifted to me by Donald Patriquin yesterday <s> I also topped off that viewing by introducing Leanne to GLEE and we watched the pilot together <s> How I love that show Just one more day in the city I am traveling away in Montreal and I have a few highlighted snapshots to show for it <smiley> Started out in Verdun QC walking from Leanne and Jeremy is apartment to the metro Heading up to the Plateau area to have lunch at Reservoir a restaurant recommended to me by my sister <s> So delicious The restaurant had a laid-back vibe but the food is gourmet in a non-pretentious way <s> The menu was all in French on a chalkboard and I ordered something where I recognized the words isalmon and apple 'but I wasn 't wholly sure of what the dish was <s> However I did find out it was a pan fried salmon which was topped off with deep fried sweet onions on a baked slice of apple <s> I know it sounds like a strange combination but it was so inventive and appetizing <s> I have never tasted anything in my life like it <s> To top it off I got warm crusty bread to go along with my latte Then I was off to a concert at St <s> James United Church to see Leanne play in her string trio <s> In between waiting for busses to arrive and dodging hobos at church entrances I couldn 't get into I unfortunately was late and missed their piece since they were first in the program <s> But I did catch the other performers and they sounded great <s> The church was also a really nice venue for music <s> After the concert I met up with Canadian composer Donald Patriquin and chatted about music over sushi <s> What an excellent combination We did a gift swap at the end where I passed along some music from the Cantilon Chamber Choir and he shared a <smiley> with a musical he wrote music and directed call 'Chickasaw 'He also gave me a reusable bag with a Nietzsche quote in French 'Life without music is an error 'to bring a hopeful reminder that I made the right choice about not going on the choir tour after reading my post Choral Apathy <s> Then I was off to St <s> Catherine is for shopping I raided of Simons thoroughly and afterward I gawked at beautiful things I can 't afford at Ogilvy is <s> Since I had time I went to Schwartz for a smoked Montreal meat sandwich <s> I was told that I HAD to eat here and after dodging the hobo outside the door lots of hobo run-in is today I enjoyed a deli sandwich at the counter <s> It was delicious but there was just SO much meat <s> I couldn 't even see the bread I had to divide what I thought was the midway point of the sandwich and eat 4 separate pieces with a fork and knife <s> It is very much a eat-and-go restaurant since there is always a line-up but I think it would be a much more relaxing dining experience if I went back with some more people next time <s> Then I took the bus back to the <weirdcaps> area and had a chai latte at Art Java <s> It was nice to just sit down and read the <weirdcaps> student newspaper <s> Olympic news was also on the t v so I enjoyed how people were in Stanley Park golfing since the weather was so nice and warm for the Olympics <s> It was also just nice to be near other students even though they were all there cramming for exams and finishing up their papers before their reading week which happens to be a next week <s> After meeting up with Leanne we came back to her place and baked chai spice cookies from scratch and had a craft evening where we made cards <s> What a fantastic way to unwind after a very productive day Because I believe in sharing delicious things here is

friend Leanne whom I sang with in Con Fuoco and Jeremy her lovely husband Meet up with Canadian composer Donald Patriquin for a tour of the <weirdcaps> music department-yay for connecting with awesome music people though blog comments Shop at Simons -yes this is totally unrelated to music or choir but I am still a girl and girls shop when they travel <smiley> Drinking hot chocolate and eating copious amounts of Montreal deli sandwiches Coming back home to perform in the Cantilon Broadway Gala is performance of Fi 'ler on the Roof I 'll be back just in time for the Broadway Gala performance <s> If you read my post on it last year you can bet it 'll be a fun evening indeed <s> We do the dress rehearsal that afternoon and the performance that evening <s> I am missing all of the blocking rehearsals next week leading up to the performance but thankfully we blocked Belle Canto is main numbers and for the other group pieces I can easily assimilate myself into the background <s> I know my notes and words so I am not worried <s> Take care and stay warm for those in chilly climates like mine I 'll definitely be blogging when I am in Montreal next week so stay tuned I have put off writing this post for a while because frankly it kills me to be talking about it <s> For as long as I have been in choir I have enjoyed the perks of being in a choir from free food to the chance to tour amazing places <s> In the beginning years of the Chamber Choir my first tour was to Regina SK after that was Vancouver BC following that was my first international tour where we went to Wales for the Llangollen Music Festival then there was a mini choir exchange tour to Toronto ON <s> Next I was off on my next large international trip Hungary Vienna and Prague for the Bela Bartok Festival <s> Then I had a few years break but I still had the chance to go on a mini trip to Victoria B <s> C for a day to sing at a music conference <s> However after a few years in Belle Canto we were off to Cork Ireland to compete in the Cork International Choral Festival Then I was extremely lucky to be able to return to Cork the following year because the University of Alberta Madrigal singers entered the same festival as well Yes I have been extremely lucky to travel to so many places <s> Yes I have been blessed to have had the opportunity to sing in amazing venues <s> Yes touring is a luxury and I have been given an experience that some people will never be exposed to <s> It still hurts though <s> Since I haven 't explained myself very well 'it 'refers to the fact that Belle Canto is off to compete in the Seghizzi Choral Festival in Italy this July and I am not going <s> This is the first time that I have been left out of a choir tour <s> Don 't get me wrong it has nothing to do with the choir I know they would all be happy to have me there but it is the first time where 'life 'has interfered with my choral passions <s> The reason I will not be able to head off to Italy and have wonderful choral adventures is that my Masters program is packed with clinic and courses that I need to complete which coincidentally runs until the end of July <s> For a few months in the summer last year after accepting my place in the program I toyed with the idea of going to Italy maybe even just for the weekend Show up compete in the classes and then head back to Canada without missing on any major coursework or clinic time My mind buzzed with this possibility Maybe it was possible to have the best of both worlds <punctuationfreak> Alas the stress of not knowing what I would be missing until July arrived and by that point already having my tickets booked just didn 't cut it for me <s> Also I usually extend my trip and travel after the competition since I am already over there but a 3-day weekend blitz would not really allow for that <s> I had to make a decision and school won out <s> However I have to admit that when I received my acceptance call from the University after the initial shock from that message died down the FIRST thing that popped into my head was 'That means I can 't go to Italy ' <smiley> For a second I felt like declining my Masters acceptance I realize that may sound a bit sick to some of you readers <s> Clearly I did not act on this natural choral reflex of mine my parents would have probably slaughtered me after first giving me a raging lecture on how I shamed them and all their efforts to raise me <s> I have slowly come to terms with the fact that I won 't be able to go trying to find trivial details to make me feel better like 'That means I don 't have to fundraise like crazy this year Whoot <date> saved ' 'Nobody knows where Seghizzi is anyway ' and 'The performance venue doesn 't look that nice ' <s> All in attempt to placate my silently suffering self <s> I have never been through such a bout of choral apathy <s> It is a deadly thing <s> It is the crippling unmotivation that is getting me <s> I feel like I have nothing to work towards this year <s> Why should I memorize that piece I won 't be able to sing it anyway <s> Why should I go to that performance I don 't need performance experience anyway <s> Maybe it is even better for me not to sing since I am just throwing off the group balance that actually will be touring <s> I 've always known it is important to have a common goal in choir whether it is for a particular concert or competition but once that end goal is no longer in sight it is hard to motivate yourself to continue what you 're doing <s> We all need something to drive us and inspire us to be better <s> When that stimulus is gone we 're directionless <s> Meanwhile I am excited that my choir is going and watching them buzz over the amazing experiences to come I get to hear about their travel plans and the amazing gigs they are lining up for themselves such as singing in St <s> Mark is Cathedral for Sunday service in Venice However I can find myself detaching from it since I find it hurts less <s> The less I know about their wonderful tour plans the less I know about the things I am missing out on <s> It is not a great strategy but it is the one I am currently employing <s> Silent detachment with a hint of grin-and-bear-it <s> I suppose it would be easier if I could blame this on something <s> Blame it on the choir for not wanting me there That is not the case <s> Blame it on my passion-consuming program Which is not the case for the most part <s> Blame it all on me Even though I know I made right choice since there wasn 't really a choice <s> All I can do is wish them the best <s> Cheer them on while they 're overseas competing <s> Hope they bring back a 1st place standing so I can bask in the glory as well because hey even though I am not standing on the same stage as them in Italy doesn 't mean I am not still a part of the choir <smiley> Oh and for any of my fellow choristers reading this post I also wouldn 't say no to them bringing home a handsome Swedish choir boy for me <smiley> In the meantime take care readers I hope this wasn 't too much of a oh-woe-is-me blog post I really do wish my choir the best and you can bet I 'll be singing with them up until the day they leave on that plane to Italy Oops I can 't believe I missed the one year anniversary of my blog To think that January 19 <date> is when it all began <s> Though I can 't say that blogging has forever changed my life it definitely made my past year much more interesting <s> As well it is a very therapeutic way to express my musical thoughts and meet awesome readers I was able to try my hand at electromusic composition a year ago and I posted lots of fun sound clips of my work for you all to listen to and documented my musical project progress along the way <s> Blogging also gave me some amazing opportunities to attend and review excellent concerts put on by the Edmonton Symphony Orchestra such as Carmina Burana and the Symphony Under the Sky Festival in Hawrelak park <s> It was also an exciting time when I was the blog of note for August 20 <date> and I had hundreds of visitors checking out my page It was overwhelming to get that amount of traffic but it was so exciting to hear from people around the world who had the same choral passions as I <s> I like to think that I was able to post a wide array of entries such as the evolution of choral uniforms to more thoughtful entries documenting my choral involvement such as my first time out at camp and my first choir rehearsal <s> I also hoped that you have enjoyed some of my choral tidbits for success such as faking confidence and having a successful candlelight procession <smiley> Overall I just want to say thanks to all my readers for actually reading what I have to say It is staggering to think that people actually want to read my choral thoughts I 've really tried to write my entries in an engaging way since I do believe that there are still people not completely sold on the idea of choral music <s> It probably doesn 't help that one the only times choral music makes it way into mainstream media is when there are booming adult voices singing ominous choruses at a climactic film moment <s> I am thinking of the two-on-one lighttsaber duel between Qui-Gon Obi-Wan and Darth Maul at the end of Star Wars Episode I <s> As stimulating as the Duel of the Fates battle sequence was choral music is so much more than loud chorus singing Choir is such a dynamic and engaging way to unify individual voices to create an amazing acoustic texture <s> No choir sounds the same because no choir has the same singers <s> Every voice has a unique role within a choir and that results in the enjoyment of singing as well as the challenges that choirs face <s> While I probably don 't need to change your mind per say since you probably have been following my posts due to a personal interest in choral singing there are still so many more people out who need to experience the a 'iction that is choir <s> However if you dear reader are not a chorister but still enjoy my posts <s> I feel like I have done my job <s> Take care and talk soon

KNIT two three four Cross-posted from my garden blog This is Mr <s> Licorice sometimes known as Mr <s> Fangs and Claws He came to us as a half-grown abandoned kitten that wandered into a co-worker is garage <s> Out of all our feline herd Licorice is the only one who goes outdoors on his own <s> Even though he is neutered he acts like an intact tom aggressive territorial foul tempered when he is indoors aggressive territorial and happy to be petted and adored when he is outdoors <s> Prozac failed to curb his behavior and while tempting I can 't keep him under sedation all the time <s> So we had him microchipped put a reflective collar on him cross our fingers and hope for the best knowing that outdoor cats are exposed to all sorts of risks <s> Well Licorice must have run head-on into one of those risks because Monday evening he came in with an open sore on his chest that on inspection looked like an abscess that had opened up <s> He seemed chipper enough and had a good appetite but the next morning it was still open and oozing and had a foul odor so I confined him to the sick kitty crate for observation and called the vet <s> Most likely he 'd gotten into a fight with another cat and since the wound was on his chest he was not the one who backed down Yeah that is our Mr <s> Fangs and Claws <s> Wednesday morning after a dose of sedative so getting him in the kitty carrier wasn 't quite as bad as wrestling a cactus he went into the vet is office <s> By then he 'd developed a fever and the wound was still draining <s> When the vet got him under anesthesia and got the abscess open it was pretty bad <s> It had gone deep the fluid inside was thick and smelly and there was a patch of skin that had gone necrotic <s> If we 'd tried to treat this at home he wouldn 't have lasted long <s> So Licorice came home that evening and went straight back into the sick kitty crate <s> He was pretty agitated and loopy coming off the anesthetic so I covered the crate with blankets trying to calm him down <s> The next morning he was very quiet and subdued probably hurting from the surgery <s> His appetite was good though <s> And this morning he is a little brighter and demanding to be let out of his crate sorry it is kind of a nasty view of the drains in his incision He is eating well and using the litter box so recovery looks good but he is not a happy kitty <s> Hates the plastic cone <s> Hates being confined <s> Hates it when the other cats come and stare at him <s> Poor sad kitty That was a <date> hit to our bank account and we were already tapped out

and from an LYS long gone <s> I still have two more skeins of the stuff to play with <s> The shawl went amazingly fast <s> Started it on the 28th of December Finished knitting and weaving in ends on

my pain management doctor to get the pain under control and then see what my LLMD had to say about my reaction to Tindamax I was planning to see both doctors within a week of each other anyway I saw my LLMD on Friday <s> I told him how I reacted to the Tindamax--which was entirely different than I 'd reacted to Flagyl a similar drug--and he suggested that it is highly likely that Tindamax and I are just not compatible <s> That my extreme emotional walloping was the result of a nasty drug side effect and not a herx die-off reaction <s> So no more Tindamax for me <s> Done <s> Since Tindamax was my cyst-killing agent we needed to plug that gap in my medication regimen <s> Plaquenil may or may not kill cysts depending on whose research you read <s> So I might be covered there <s> But we

<s> It is no secret that I hate Thomas the Tank Engine <s> I hate most moralising children is shows but I reserve particular venom for Thomas despite the fact I loved the stories when younger and have seen a marvelous stage show <s> Thomas and his friends are a whiny bunch of disobedient brats everything about them is gloomy and miserable and tedious <s> There is no joy and to top it off every new series has half-a-dozen pointless new characters crow-barred in solely for the merchandising opportunity <s> I hate Thomas which is not to say that we don 't own quite a lot of Thomas kit <s> It is unavoidable and part of the reason why I have a particularly soft spot for other less overtly commercial offerings 'Pingu ' for example 'Miu Mao ' the fabulous Italian claymation cats and Peppa Pig <s> Years ago a friend of mine informed me that her three-year-old son loved Peppa Pig and I was slightly bemused as to why a boy would like a show focused on a pink girl-pig but the moment the spud was old enough to watch <smiley> I understood <s> Peppa like Pingu and the cats is all about fun there is no harsh moral <s> Sometimes someone might be a little bit naughty often things go a bit wrong but there is no breast-beating only kindness and funny and pigs falling about laughing <s> I love Peppa Pig <s> In fact I may possibly have just the teeniest tiniest crush on Da 'y Pig as it happens <s> We already have two Peppa DVDs - it was Peppa who informed my spud that Santa comes down the chimney Peppa who showed him that it is OK to jump into a mu 'y pu 'le and Peppa who makes him laugh at me every time we hear that Peppa is Mummy loves her computer <s> We probably wouldn 't have bought the latest <smiley> however having been given it for review I have to say that if you have a boy who loves Peppa or who hasn 't met her yet this is officially your <smiley> <s> It is called ' Peppa Pig The Fire Engine and other stories ' and in it Peppa goes on a train a fire engine a rocket and there is even a pirate episode <s> Seriously all she needs to do now is to go on a bus and an airplane and the spud might never watch anything again <s> Until he is buying porn on the internet in 10 years time that is <s> Oh and by the way the nice Peppa Pig folks have given me an extra copy of 'Peppa Pig The Fire Engine 'to pass on to one of you if you can tell me in 20 words or so why you love Peppa or hate Thomas and make me laugh in the process - UK format only I believe <s> I only have one copy to give away though so funniest wins as judged by me and a team of Mummy mates next Friday <s> Well that was a long time to leave you with a nauseating post <s> Turns out that staying up and working to 2am 5 or 6 days a week don 't leave much time for er anything really <s> I was going to write about the little opening ceremony we went to for Brixton is fancy new square but I lack the motivation to get the pictures off my camera <s> Instead I am going to write about the flip-side of parenting the dark side of my little spud-u-like the side we 've been seeing for a few days now <s> It starts this slide into the netherworld with a bad night <s> Perhaps he had a nightmare perhaps a cough whatever it is if he has to get up early the next day he is guaranteed to be in the sort of mood which involves the phrase 'I don 't want to ' as in 'I don 't want to get up ' 'I don 't want to get dressed ' 'I don 't want to eat breakfast ' 'I don 't want to go to nursery ' <s> Eventually of course he does all those things <s> Recently he is taken to wanting me to pull him home from nursery on his scooter which does my back in <s> On a bad day if I refuse he whinges all the way home 'It is too difficult ' 'I am too heavy ' 'I don 't want to ' or more accurately 'I am too difficult ' Today was bad <s> He screamed blue murder all the way up our quiet street <s> I offered to carry his scooter I held his hand I walked 3 feet in front encouraging him to follow I stopped I pushed him gently from behind thinking it would be fun this is what it sounded like to the neighbours 'No Mummy No Mummy Not like that Don 't go far away Mummy Don 't leave me Don 't Stop You 're pushing me down You 're pushing me down ' We got to our front steps and he refused to walk up instead lying down on the wet pavement sobbing at the top of his lungs <s> I tried to pick him up and he flopped <s> I practically had to stuff him into the house <s> Within seconds of getting inside he was happily demanding pasta and turning on the Wii <s> I was at the window nervously waiting for child services to show up <s> Inevitably the day closed to a familiar sound-track 'I don 't want to habba bath ' 'I don 't want to wear my jamas ' ' 'I don 't want to go to bed ' <s> Eventually of course he did all those things <s> The key word here is 'eventually ' as it takes a lot of negotiation to get him to stay in bed and even then he can remain defiant until the last Crap <s> Seriously help me here I am about to commit a proper blogging crime <s> A cardinal sin if you like <s> I am about to get irrationally gooey <s> I am about to vomit saccharine emotion all over your screen <s> You can stop reading

to <s> Seriously you go <s> Right <s> Let is get this mess started <s> So tonight the spud decided to go to sleep in our bed and since I was tired too we both had a bath and got into our jammies and lay down in bed <s> I read him 3 Dr <s> Seuss books <s> He had some warm milk <s> We pulled up the duvet <s> He snaked a little arm under my head and pulled me to his cheek <s> I was feeling I have to tell you pretty relaxed at that point <s> Then the frog came home and picked up a guitar and immediately the spud wanted to 'play your tar 'The frog put the guitar on the bed and we played then he left to have his own bath and I made the two chords that I know while the spud strummed <s> OK here it comes <s> I showed my boy a little tune and we lazed about having fun with it and not talking and then out of the blue he turned to me looked at me levelly for a second and said 'I love you really big ' and he smiled beatifically as though he had just given me a holy benediction <s> Then he turned and went back to the guitar <s> You see <s> Very very very sweet <s> Pretty much enough to hoist your pancreas into overdrive <s> Thanks for letting me spew that one out <s> I 'll get me coat <s> We had one of the Spud is best friends over for a playdate yesterday <s> They see each other infrequently now that the Spud has left the wonderful-but-far-away Montessori nursery where they both went and is now at the less-than-wonderful-but-close local nursery but they are still great mates and I am very fond of his Mum which is always a bonus <s> There is always a sting in the tail when we see this particular friend because although he is lovely and gentle and funny and bright having continued with Montessori he can write his own name now <s> Yes I know <s> No no same age <s> Exactly yes born on the same day even <s> Sigh <s> Anyway so on Saturday during lunch he was lecturing the spud on what was going to happen to his fish fingers because he now knows that food goes into the mouth down the gullet then into the stomach through to the little intestine into the big intestine and then comes out as poo <s> The spud was fascinated <s> I nearly ate my hand in envy it wouldn 't fit down my gullet <s> I have never wanted to be one of those pushy parents that force information into their offspring but er it is quite cool to you know watch kids learn stuff <s> And stuff <s> So today when he was complaining that his tummy hurt I took the opportunity to remind my Spud of those things his friend had told him <s> I reminded him that he had a full tummy AND a full intestine and he might need to do a poo something he is managed to avoid for a couple of days <s> This resulted in him doing a series of fairly alarming stomach contractions <s> Thinking he was going to make himself ill I asked him what was wrong and he said 'Nuffin <s> I am trying to make my poo flat so my tummy doesn 't hurt 'A little information <s> A dangerous thing <s> We had an accidental playdate on Tuesday <s> We were leaving the nursery when the very brave mother of one of his friends invited us around for pancakes as she was already having a few people over <s> It was pouring with rain and I left the house under the shelter of my new umbrella an item I am capable of losing in seconds as witnessed by the fact that I lost it twice the day I bought it <s> This is normal umbrella etiquette for me 10 years ago I lost 3 of them in two days and until this recent purchase I haven 't owned one since <s> I also packed a pocket umbrella for the Spud an item which has survived for the entirety of my marriage to the Frog purely because I made a pact never to use it <s> We headed out from nursery a little pack of bedraggled humans under various hoods and brollies <s> We arrived and immediately the children formed a pack and started pulling the house to pieces while us Mums formed a second pack and destroyed a bottle of wine <s> Pancakes were made <s> Pancakes were eaten <s> Bedtime passed <s> Nobody noticed for at least an hour <s> By the time we left it was quarter past nine and pouring with rain <s> The spud insisted on riding his scooter so I carried his bag my bag and triumphantly both of our umbrellas <s> We walked along him scooting next to me under my shelter and me feeling incredibly unbelievably smug for not having left our brollies at either the nursery or with our friends <s> I thought as we walked through the rain-dark streets happily talking about how deep the pu 'les were and what a fun evening we had that perhaps I am finally to be trusted with an umbrella <s> Perhaps I thought my native forgetfullness has been cured by the a 'ed need for attention that motherhood brings and that perhaps - just perhaps - this one might be for keepsies <s> I was smug all the way home until I realised I was wearing only my jacket and that my coat with my house-keys still in its pocket was hanging forgotten over our host is balustrade <s> Ah me <s> One of the things I felt the lack of when I was pregnant was a sense of continuity for my child <s> My husband and I live ages from our families neither of us have a family home or church or school that we can hope our child will go to there is no family christening gown or aged rocking horse <s> I thought everything was going to have to be new <s> About a year ago however I loaded onto the record player in his room a Dr <s> Seuss album from the <date> s which I have been toting around with me since well since the <date> s frankly <s> It was The Sleep Book b-side If I ran the Zoo <s> He loves it but he likes 'Green Eggs and Ham ' even more which we read along with the record <s> Shortly afterwards I went to visit my parents and discovered a box of wonders in their cellar <s> Now he drifts off to sleep under a Winnie The Pooh blanket made for me when I was his age by some unidentified aunt perhaps or family friend he plays with my ancient building blocks and eats his pasta from my old Bunnykins bowl which the frog hates too twee and bourgeois and covered in bunnies and he plays with some of my old cars including a tiny London bus I 've had for at least 35 years which he refers to as 'your special bus Mummy ' <s> It is cool I am remembering more and more things from my early years <s> We 're singing songs from 'Little Toot ' while he is in the bath a title which I have to say always makes me chuckle and go 'la la la ' a lot - because what girl can remember all the words to a song about a tugboat 40 years after the fact I am enjoying handing these pieces of my childhood on to my own child and am very conscious that this sharp and often wearisome thing we call the present is actually his past and the most important thing we can give him <s> There are a few more things in the mystery box that he will inherit as the years go by but the most important thing is of course a sense of family a sense of continuity <s> Something that I hope ultimately will hold me in good stead when I am old and frail and in need of a real special bus or at least a son with enough charity to keep an eye out for his old Ma and perhaps wrap her knees with a Pooh blanket on a cold afternoon <s> Well just what I always wanted having to take a holiday day because Charlie has been excluded from nursery for having a runny tummy <s> I am not sure what is worse him being ill which judging by his performance today he isn 't or me having to waste a holiday day during an exceedingly busy period at work <s> I am still not feeling tippy top after a few days of illness although have managed popcorn and a banana today <repeatedchars> healthy but given I don 't have to struggle into a desk through cold weather and rush hour traffic I could easily put in a day is work so really cannot justify a sickie <s> What is lovely however is us hanging low together <s> I am getting some work done and we 're being very very lazy <s> So far today he is painted a picture eaten copiously watched 'Shrek ' played computer games and er lordy I think that is it <s> Currently he is playing 'Shrekcart ' on my <weirdcaps> a device which is possibly under-rated as a babysitter although earlier on he took a picture of me in all my morning glory and I caught him right in the act of posting it onto Twitter so I admit to the possibility of being wrong on that one <s> Shortly we 're going to head to the park to get some air which will probably do us both some good <s> Today has all the redolence of a day off school when I was young and I 've realised why - because that is exactly what it is only this time I am in the place of my own Mum trying to get some work done while amusing my bored offspring who is well enough to feel restless but not quite well enough to be insistent <s> He is cu 'ly and funny and sweet and is playing by himself the best he can given that he is only 3 <s> It is cold outside warm inside and I see a lovely warm bath and an early bed in our future and a weekend of work but that is a few days away and for now we 'll just eat our cheese toasties get into our warm clothes and go and feed some ducks anon <s> The last few days the Frog and I have been fighting off nausea and a general sense that we feel ill <s> The spud has been his high-stepping self until this morning when halfway to an out-of-town visit about 45 minutes from home he threw up his breakfast all over himself <s> Nothing like negotiating the entry to the M4 whilst listening to one is offspring redecorate the back of the car <s> I need here to leave a word of thanks to the go 'ess as right at the entrance ramp there is a petrol station so just as he was heaving his last and seconds before we got sucked into the vortex of the motorway I was able to stop and get the poor kid cleaned and changed <s> We turned for the journey home 45 minutes of auditory and other sensory delights as the spud is stomach proved it wasn 't just fooling around <s> Once back bathed reclothed cu 'led and tucked onto the sofa with 'Ice Age 'while I washed various car-related items and two sets of his clothes he felt well enough to ask for a little warm chocolate milk and once that had been down for half an hour with no ill effects I offered him a dry biscuit <s> I have very bland taste in biscuits <s> My favourites are Digestives and if given a choice between say a Bourbon vs a Rich Tea I 'll take the Rich Tea every time <s> Recently I discovered these cheapo very plain very lo-calorie biscuits which are I believe the acme - or perhaps it should be the nadir - of how plain a biscuit can possibly be <s> I love them and I gave one to the spud an hour ago <s> He took it <s> He looked at it 'Is this for Elsie 'he said holding it up and talking about our elderly next door neighbour 'Or for Papi Georges 'his 81 year old Grandfather 'It is a Papi Georges biscuit 'Only 3 and already he is assigning food into age-appropriate brackets <s> It stayed down by the way and now he is demolishing cheerios <s> We may

<s> I 've been enjoying so much new music lately that if I could find the time I 'd have a song a day to post here <s> But given that I don 't I have to be content with once or twice a week and in doing so I invariably skip over songs that I was enjoying earlier in the week <s> So it is Sunday afternoon and the sun is shining and the children are running around the garden in the hazy light that teases us with memories of summer <s> And this here is what is playing in my kitchen <s> A sweet soulful dreamy song that makes me feel as though we have all the time in the world <s> Hear more of The Low Anthem nbsp here <s> The second song 'To Ohio ' is another favourite I have on repeat along with the above 'Charlie Darwin ' There is also a gorgeous stop-animation official video to this too which you can see nbsp here but my love of live music overrides even that and I just had to post a live video <s> Hope you had a lovely weekend <s> Enjoy Well a few weeks ago I was alerted to the fact that my favourite shop nbsp in the world now has a nbsp blog <s> I can 't remember when I first discovered nbsp Pedlars it was certainly a few years back and may have been in an interiors magazine that I first saw it mentioned <s> Over the years from the time I first received their lovely catalogue into my letterbox although I would not necessarily have been a big spender I have bought a number of things and poured longingly over many more <s> I am not sure what it is they have that makes it so appealing but I suspect it has a lot to do with their manifesto Stuff We Love That You 'll Love Too <s> In other words they buy and sell stuff they they love and they happen to have the most amazing taste in the world which in turn makes it so appealing to the likes of me nbsp One thing I immediately loved when I first flicked through their catalogue was not just the diversity of products or the overriding sense of fun or even the downright coolness of it but the broad range of prices <s> Here was a shop that had divine lighting that cost hundreds but they also had pocket-money stuff that not only could the kids afford but that they actually really wanted Of course a bit of investigating showed that of course they had lots of children themselves <s> And they lived in a beautiful house in the wilds of Scotland <s> As well as the most amazing holiday home nbsp which you can rent nbsp And lots of dogs <s> And all I could think was darn it these guys have it perfect I am sure they would laugh at that but we have to have heros don 't we By the way this is NOT the holiday home In their own words ' we also have an organic farm in Scotland and a Christmas Tree farm too <s> We have six children four dogs lots of horses and ponies and three chickens <s> We live in Scotland and in London and we have a fruit and vegetable farm in Wales <s> We are constantly on the look out for things that interests us ' Sigh <s> I love everything about Pedlars <s> They have amazing nbsp Vintage finds fantastic nbsp homewares brilliant nbsp fun stuff nbsp for all the family as well as a nbsp music club nbsp that is right after my own heart <s> In fact there is so much more to see that I have to just recommend you take yourself on over there and have a look <s> And I do think nbsp what they are doing nbsp must be the greatest job in the world <s> Imagine So if you get a chance do pop over and become a follower on their nbsp blog and you never know but you might actually win one hundred pounds to spend in their shop Because they are very clever And even though it is lame to say I was planning to do this post anyway ever since discovering their blog and definitely before I did win that very amount yesterday it is true <s> Honestly Nothing nbsp more satisfying than finding something for next to nothing is there Our local town recently had a new a 'ition of a charity thrift shop This is a very telling sign of the times and rather something as this particular well-to-do town is more home to the likes of up-market boutiques and I never thought I 'd see a charity nbsp shop there <s> But there it is and I have to say the quality is delightfully up-market But of course <s> And even better the prices are proper charity shop prices unlike certain other ones who have been taking the you-know-what of recent years <s> So I popped in the other day with very little in my purse and no intention really other than to have a look <s> But I did spend <s> A little <s> This sweet cardigan is so perfectly Julia Childs that I nbsp couldn 't resist it at just 3 <s> I think it is the colour as much as anything <s> And although this skirt for 5 doesn 't look so great on a hanger it is lovely on <s> It is years since I wore something so long and I bought it thinking I would alter it in some way but it is too nice as it is nbsp But then part of my intention not to spend was because earlier in the week nbsp I had fatally gone to my favourite shop nbsp Avoca nbsp for breakfast and as nbsp usual stopped to look at their sale rail on the way out <s> Shopping with friends nbsp can be bad for you <s> Persuasive friends <s> Friends who insist you try on that dress that made you gasp when you saw it and then rave about how perfect it is on you sigh <s> I am weak <s> I am <s> So I bought it <s> And yes it was on the sale rail but this is Avoca we are talking about nbsp So I won 't be telling you how much I paid for it even when one friend was cheeky enough to ask them to knock a bit more off it which they did nbsp It wasn 't huge <s> It was less than <date> <s> But still more than I would usually spend <s> But I had to <s> And I am glad I did <s> Because it is just so lovely <s> A friend said it is like something out of Bagpuss which is so apt because that is a world that still exists in my head <s> Some days I think in my head I am in that little shop Bagpuss amp Co <s> It is perfect <s> A shop that doesn 't sell anything <s> It is just a place for lost things <s> Take a little peep here <s> This is nbsp my childhood nbsp this is all that makes me who I am today <s> I cannot think of anything that captures it better <s> Listen here for more of Danny And The Champions Of The World <s> Here is a band we 've been listening to over the last week or so and I really wanted to share this video with you <s> I don 't think it is an official video I think it is probably fan made <s> But from the first time I watched it I 've come back to it again and again <s> Because it is just so incredibly moving nbsp It is such an uplifting song and coupled with footage that is simply people dancing it somehow breaks my heart in a good way <s> Dancing is such a human thing and done with such quiet joy and confidence and honesty with no self-consciousness that it becomes a thing of great beauty <s> And watching it my heart is filled with such great love for humans <s> I can 't explain it <s> But maybe one of you will get what I mean too <s> And even if you don 't it is a joy to watch regardless nbsp And do turn up the volume a little I can 't believe I haven 't posted here about this band before now Back in November I was thrilled to read that on the back of their new album nbsp Midlake nbsp were on tour and coming to Dublin <s> I was still feeling grumpy that I had missed out on no less than four gigs by bands I would love to have seen so I was determined not to miss this and bought tickets the day they came out <s> I 've been listening to the new album and it is just gorgeous with echoes of English Folk that just rolls over you like warm water <s> I wondered if I would like The Courage of Other is as much as I loved their previous album The Trials of Van Occupanther which is on my list of Albums I Never Get Tired Of and so far I am loving it The above song is from the Van Occupanther album <s> Have a listen nbsp here nbsp for some more songs from The Courage of Other is <s> So that is where we 'll be tomorrow night and I am looking forward to it to a night of meeting and eating with friend is a night of live music of being transported away for the evening <s> Happy Valentine is Day to you all and I hope you get to do something lovely wherever you are Update nbsp It was amazing <s> They were brilliant <s> It really is something else to see seven incredible musician is up on stage playing together like one fluid entity each playing one unique layer of sound yet knowing exactly where everyone else is all in a perfect seamless fusion of beautiful nbsp music <s> And they did nbsp take beloved songs and bring them to another level and it was everything a live show should be <s> I have to say the above song was one of the highlights for me <s> The drumming alone on this song was heady stuff and just gorgeous <s> So a happy girl I am <s> This will keep me warm for many weeks to come And A Few Of My Favourite Things <s> I was never one for fashion magazines <s> Although if someone produced a Vintage Thrift fashion magazine I would no doubt be a fan <s> The only exception might be the Irish magazine nbsp Prudence nbsp which is not only aimed at people who are broke but it doesn 't have a ridiculous price tag like most fashion mags do <s> I like that This may be why I love places like Etsy nbsp and ebay <s> But of course that takes time to browse something I don 't have an awful lot of <s> Which is why magazines are great I guess I do go through phases of buying Interiors magazines when I need inspiration my favourites being Homes and Antiques and nbsp Living Etc <s> But my absolute all-time-favourite can 't-live-without magazines have to be my monthly music regulars Uncut nbsp and nbsp Mojo <s> I just love to hide away with these and a cup of coffee nbsp for an hour or so and devour every word I can <s> It is never enough but there is a month is worth of reading in them and by the time the next one is out I have just about finished it <s> And you get a free cd each month too <s> My favourite pages are the music review pages which is where I find all sorts of jewels both new and old new bands new singers new albums rereleases <s> It is all there <s> And if I like the sound of it I 'll take myself off to Spotify nbsp to check them out Although sometimes you have to wait a couple of weeks for a new album to be available to listen to One thing I have discovered from reading these two magazines is the record label nbsp Jagjaguwar which is host to some of my all-time favourite bands like nbsp Bon Iver nbsp and nbsp Volcano Choir <s> This months Uncut included a cd of songs from bands on this label some of which I have heard of some I haven 't <s> And I wanted to share the one that jumped out for me the one I am listening to on loop <s> From British Columbia nbsp Pink Mountaintops <s> Their sound reminds me somewhat of nbsp Mazzy Star nbsp gone somewhat gospel nbsp and someone else I can 't put my finger on <s> Last year is album 'Outside Love ' is just gorgeous <s> Have a nbsp listen here The title track in particular is sublime <s> So let the mi 'le of the week just slide right on by us <s> I am focused on the weekend with the right kind of laidback sounds to keep me company <s> And plenty of reading material which I 've no doubt will furnish a number of posts here on Carnival <s> Hope your week is going swimmingly for you too <s> And what might you be listening to I have been entranced <s> Yet again <s> On loop in my kitchen in my car is 'July Flame ' the new album from the lovely Laura Veirs <s> A number of years back my sister Emma gave me a copy of 'Carbon Glacier ' which she had picked up in the <smiley> <s> I loved it <s> From the first listen <s> And the following year went straight out and bought her follow up album 'Year of Meteors ' <s> When she played in Whelan is the week before Emma went back to the states for good we went to see her sat right up the front and I cried at least twice <s> She was amazing <s> And yes I was emotional about saying goodbye to Emma <s> But Laura Veirs rocked <s> In a sweet sort of way <s> So when I read the reviews in my favourite music magazines Mojo and Uncut and words like enchanted suffused and mysticism were used I just had to check it out <s> And it didn 't disappoint me <s> As I said <s> I have been entranced <s> And the inclusion of the likes of Laura Gibson and the mighty Jim James of My Morning Jacket just sends me into raptures There is hardly a wrong note on the whole thing <s> Laura is on tour at the moment though I was very sad to read they won 't be coming to Dublin this time <s> But seeing as Laura is very pregnant I figured it wouldn 't be fair to make a fuss Do check out her nbsp blog nbsp over on her website <s> And while there you can have a look at some of their other nbsp videos nbsp too <s> You can also listen and buy her six other albums as well as a recording of a young French choir who recorded nine of her songs the result of which is a strangely moving experience <s> If you think you might be interested you can also listen to more from Laura Veirs nbsp here <s> And read reviews or download songs nbsp here <s> I so wish I could post the track called 'Little Deschutes ' here for you to listen to <s> I am listening to it as I write with goosebumps <s> It truly is sublime <s> But the album is so new I haven 't found it anywhere that can post here <s> So have a listen if you come across it ' I wanted to make something sweet The blood inside the maple tree the sunlight trapped inside the wood make something good ' Nothing like a weekend away is there As I mentioned nbsp over on Milkmoon myself and Jay managed to escape for a long weekend to visit some friends Marta and Sam in Madrid <s> And as everyone knows there is nothing better than having someone who knows the city for finding the best of everything So there was endless wanderings around the streets of Madrid and on Saturday myself and Marta took ourselves off nbsp and we found a number of vintage shops which I was very excited about <s> And let me say the prices were amazing <s> This sweet dress was 18 and it is in mint condition <s> I am loving tweed and plaid at the moment and I couldn 't resist this rather school mistressy kilt for 10 It is <date> wool and so warm which was just what I needed as we traipsed about in the snow <s> And this gorgeous leather bag which we both admired in the window Marta bought and then gave to me sweet thing that she is was <date> <punctuationfreak> I love it so much I could have filled an entire suitcase with fabulous finds but as we were restricted both financially and in terms of baggage I had to limit myself sadly <s> But I am already planning my next trip hopefully in June for Finn is

for NO reason at all except that he didn 't want to be there anymore well I take that back he DID want to be there right ON the floor <s> He was COMPLETELY calm while laying on the nasty gross dirty floor but when I went to pick him up the kicking wiggling amp screaming began <s> And it was ugly very very ugly indeed I am glad it was dark dim in there because I was probably turning 47 shades of red from sheer embarrassment amp humiliation <s> The stares from everyone in line were nearly unbearable for me <s> I am one who lets what others think really bother me and while I realize I will never see any of those people again I was still quite upset about the crazy scene that my fabulous son was making Dawn AKA 'the baby whisperer ' was waiting in line with us and since she didn 't want to ride she was able to take E out of line once we reached the point where the line opens up and allows you to do that which seemed about <date> miles away at the time <s> I have never felt a greater sense of relief in my life once he was out of line amp no longer sprawled out on the floor <s> Note I went on this trip to <smiley> with plans to ride only <math> things and instead spend the majority of time on things E would enjoy and after this experience in line I really didn 't care if I went on another single ride all weekend Thankfully that was the ONLY time he had a full meltdown over the

you learn alot once you start USING an item <s> I am ready for new dishes but waiting until more of these break <s> Beth wanted to see my laundry room <s> This would probably be the most boring and drab room in the house <s> In fact I just recently told O I want to paint it because <math> it is plain white and <math> it is right off the garage so receives all kinds of bangs to the wall etc and could use a coat of paint to brighten it up please leave me your color suggestions <s> Hopefully in my next house I 'll have a bigger laundry room it was really something I was searching for before we bought this house but just didn 't work out <s> This was a hard picture to take hence two shots one from each side because literally the room is only the length of the two machines side my side <s> Hydrant Girl wanted to see my favorite part of the house that would be my office when I am able to get in there and really get things done or just relax and surf the web <s> Travel amp Dive Girl wanted to see my kitchen counter where I do my baking it is not much and it is a bit smaller than I 'd like it but I make do for now <s> That corner cabinet is where all my baking ingredients are stored so at least it is convenient <s> Sara wanted to see my living room as it is now eeks toys abound and if you look closely you can see E is head near the fireplace he was likely a 'ing more toys to the floor <s> Oh and that window treatment is a thorn in my side it never stays in place so it usually just looks like a piece of fabric thrown up there <s> Lindsay wanted to see a view from E is perspective i took 2 shots <s> Fidgeting Gidget wanted to see my favorite shirt and my softball glove <s> I am a 'life is good 't-shirt junkie and I really like this one right now 'less is <smiley>

nutrition topics <s> I need to do some classroom guidance in the CDC room for the rest of the semester <s> I am way behind on my direct hours made a call to the Disney ticket office got good news which will hopefully prevent me from losing a day on my 3 day ticket since we only made it to the parks on Sat amp Sun heading to the post office this afternoon to mail 4 packages i really need to get all this school stuff done so I can use the weekend to do a transcription of one of my counseling sessions that will occur Thurs Fri this week <s> Note transcriptions take FOREVER every single word

where to send your Disney prize I have not been able to download my pictures yet but here is a brief review of the race hoping to post pictures later tonight The short story I met my time goal finished the <date> miles and I avoided the 'van of doom ' the one that picks you up if you fall behind a <math> min mile pace <s> Phew <punctuationfreak> I got about 4 hrs of sleep the night before the race amp was fighting off some intense nerves which caused me to have a super upset tummy all night long and then I woke 30 minutes before the alarm ugh <s> A rough start I met Meghan Jessica and Beth in the lobby at absolutely insane hour of 3 30am to head to the race start <s> We waited around some used the porta-potties some froze some checked our gear headed to our corral froze some more peed in the bushes where I got burrs all over the back of my shirt and then finally started our race Meghan Beth Page Beth is friend and I were all in Corral E and started at 6 28am after being 'in process 'for 3 hours Meghan and I ran the first 9 or so miles together doing <math> intervals after running the entire first mile at about the 9 mile mark I could not continue with Meghan as I needed more recovery time she kept going and I lagged behind with a bit more walking although not too much more <s> In the end I finished 6 minutes after her At every mile mark there was a princess-theme billboard w time clock and music <s> There were tons of characters along the way as well and while we thought we would stop for pictures we quickly changed our mind when we saw the crazy long lines I realized how much I like the song 'Holding Out for a Hero 'by Bonnie Tyler <smiley> Really though it has got to be THE perfect amake-you-want-to-run isong <s> Or maybe it was just that it was playing as I passed the Disney float thingee with 5 Disney Princes on it i dunno let is just say it was the song My goal was to finish under 3 hours and I barely did just that 2 58 26 was my finish time <s> I am already thinking that is not good enough and want to improve it <s> I am sure these feelings will fade in a couple of days <s> LOL <punctuationfreak> I would love to do the Princess <math> again next year and I am making tentative plans in my head so now it is just a matter of the stars aligning correctly i e date timing I took a bunch of pictures <s> I haven 't totaled them up yet but I will do that tonight and post the winner Oh and I am still putting together that 'pictures of my home 'post hoping to finish that and post this week too

<s> I can 't hear you cuz I am stupid This is going to be a rant <s> If you 're not interested in reading a rant come back later when I am closer to a glass half full of the milk of human kindness <s> I 'd like to have a little talk about cell phones <s> I don 't mean how people so often answer them when they 're with other people- friends or strangers- and then have the conversation right there in front of us all as if we 'd just before asked what they were up to these days 'Oh my that is such a long story <s> I know Listen in on this call and it 'll give you a snapshot 'I also don 't mean the people who use their cell phones at unsafe times <s> Say when they 're crossing the street <s> Or when they 're turning left on a green light and they 're supposed to yield but instead when the phone rings and it is their dad they feel they have to take it so they do and they drive right into the front of my car and total it <s> Being nearly a half century old provides one with more than just a sense of perspective it also means one can remember things Okay not everything <s> And no not always where the car is parked at the store as well as what one is to buy at the store <s> But I know the words and tune to two different versions of 'Hound Dog ' all three versions of the Free Credit Report dot Com ads plus the Hillshire Farms commercials and I know that Pure Prairie League performed 'Amie ' <s> So it is not like my brain is devoid of all usefull information One thing I remember very clearly is how people used phones before there were cellphones 'Yeah yeah <s> Most people remember phones before cellphones <s> We remember early cellphones <s> Why on the first few season is of 'The X Files ' Mulder is cellphone was so big it looked like he was talking into Maxwell Smart is shoe 'I remember when all I really wanted for Christmas was a Princess phone <s> I remember when my grandmother refused to use her phone during certain hours because she had a party line - which isn 't as much fun as it sounds and doesn 't cost <date> per minute- and she didn 't want to interfere with her neighbor is rights and opportunities to use the phone <s> And I remember how people reacted when they got a long distance call <s> I didn 't know anyone who got a call from overseas in all the cases I witnessed the participants were four hours or fewer apart from each other <s> For each instance the behavior was the same Someone would answer the phone they 'd determine the identity of the caller and who they wished to speak to then they would turn to that person and hiss 'It is your mother '- if it was their mother- then in a much louder hiss they 'd a ' 'Long distance ' <s> You 're probably wondering why someone would say 'long distance 'at that point <s> If you live in Wisconsin and your mother lives in California and she is calling you from there then naturally she is calling you long distance <s> No one should have to explain the conditions to you in other words <s> But the phrase 'long distance 'was not uttered sotto voce for the benefit of the intended recipient of the call <s> It was a cue to the other people in hearing distance as to how they should behave <s> Televisions and radios were shut off <s> Depending on the time of day children were taken outside or to other rooms where they were shushed <s> It didn 't really matter that these precautions were taken to render the vicinity as quiet as possible <s> It didn 't matter because the first thing the person who was handed the receiver did was shout into it 'HELLO MOTHER <s> IT 'S GOOD TO HEAR YOUR VOICE 'Why did they do this Some of them did it because America was more rural then and they had grown up running and yelling and working and playing outside <s> They were used to arguing baseball rules across a field and calling people to dinner who were in the back forty <s> The other reason many people shouted was because this was a long distance call <s> These were not stupid people <s> They were leading productive lives <s> They had most likely not seen the highly informative video 'How Your Phone Works 'but if they 'd thought about it they probably grasped the idea that there were wires running into their house and into Mrs <s> Avery is house and into Mom is house that carried the conversations <s> Well if everything is being transported by wires then it doesn 't really matter how far away the other person is does it There are wires here and wires there and it all works the same whether it is Mrs <s> Avery down the block or Mom in California <s> Right Technically yes Of course it also costs a hell of a lot more to talk to Mom in California and to this day I 've yet to have anyone explain that to me in a satisfactory manner But in practice no <s> The further away the other person was the louder you had to shout <s> I am reminded of those earlier headier days of phone usage whenever I am out in public but especially when I cross the river and visit the more sophisticated city of Portland <s> Portland after all is bleeding edge <s> Nike is there <s> IT firms are there <s> They had a plan to free wi-fi for the whole city <s> Portlanders know their technology <s> You can figure I was surprised then when I realized how many Portlanders were shouting into their cellphones <s> Whether they 're leading productive lives or not these people are stupid <s> This is <date> not <date> and I have different expectations for people is behavior and their understanding of how things work <s> We have all seen enough news stories about overheard intercepted cell phone calls to get that conversations are transmitted over radio waves and you don 't need to shout just because there isn 't a wire running out the end of your phone If you want to learn about the beginnings of wireless communication- Hey You might find it interesting- you can read about the Alohanet here I don 't think lack of knowledge about how cellphones work is what is causing most people to shout into them <s> I think it is caused by stupidity <s> I really believe people are shouting into their phones because they 're too ignorant to realize they 're trying to use the phone in the wrong place <s> Not wrong because it is offensive although sometimes that is also true <s> Wrong because there are environmental factors preventing the phone from fulfilling its purpose of enabling communication <s> You 've probably seen these people If you were one of these people I doubt you would have read this far In an elevator descending in a parking garage built by someone whose sideline was fashioning fall-out shelters spoken loudly 'Yes I am on my way to the car now 'Another floor down and the thick walls and wiring interfere as if speaking to someone who is old or a non-native speaker of English 'I said I am in an elevator and I am on the way to the car <s> Can you hear me I <s> AM <s> IN <s> AN <s> ELEVATOR 'One floor below the sign reading 'Abandon all hope 'but the phone user hasn 't in a voice used for calling 'Chow is on 'to the back forty 'Can you hear me Hello Hello I was in an elevator 'Shakes phone This works for remotes and flashlights but I 've never seen it work with a phone <smiley> 'Screw it I 'll have to drive over and do this in person ' <s> But these were not the stupidest people I saw <s> That dubious honor goes to the folks who were walking beside the Max train talking on their cellphones <s> They had the phone up to one ear and they would put their fingers in or hand over their other ear- the one closest to the train tracks- in an attempt to block out the noise and continue the conversation <s> Unless you 're negotiating a hostage situation an organ transplant or a way to make people stop knitting or crocheting those Martha Stewart 'Freedom 'ponchos then there is no reason not to stop and continue your conversation somewhere and somewhen else <s> After all at this point it seems to be consisting of 'Talk louder I can 't hear you I am walking beside an effing train trying to shout over it What Because I am completely stupid 'Okay <s> Maybe that last was really just editorializing on my part <s> I can 't be sure though <s> It is hard to hear well when you 're standing beside an effing train <s> Quotidian Economics I have recently become friends with one of the young men in one of my computer classes <s> I am not sure how young as he says his birthdate is the equivalent of a state secret and he has had to kill people to protect it <s> On the other hand he is young enough not to recognize that 'Say 'Good night ' Dick 'is a reference to Dick Martin of 'Laugh-In 'as opposed to Dick Cavett the talk show host Does anyone besides me remember the series of comedy shows Dick Cavett put together for radio I heard them on the Armed Forces Radio Network but they had to have started out somewhere else first He wears a lot of message T-shirts with sayings on them like 'I won 't lower my standards to raise yours ' <s> He is one of those intense people who feels that everyone should be learning philosophy and that philosophy should be the basis for a civilization 'If only people thought more about what they 're doing and why the world would be a much better place 'he told me today 'If people treated one another fairly and ethically there would be peace and everyone would get along 'Do you know why more people don 't study philosophy 'I said 'No 'I took a class years ago that explained that people didn 't even consider things like 'What am I doing ' and 'Why am I doing it ' until society was sufficiently industrialized that it could afford a leisure class <s> Most people then and I happen to think most people now as well were too busy trying to get by trying to eke out a living <s> But then again it depends on what you mean by philosophy doesn 't it 'Are you saying people are too busy studying economics to study philosophy 'I am saying that if you 're living hand to mouth and you can barely feed your family or if that is your perception then you 're probably not thinking about why you 're doing something <s> One reason you 're not thinking about it is that the answer is obvious you 're doing what you can and what you need to do to acquire food and shelter and clothing for the people who are your responsibility <s> You 're not worried about the people outside your circle because it is someone else is job to look after them <s> During the Irish Potato Famine there were probably very few people sitting around saying 'Does everything work towards the common good in this world 'That is just it though 'he said 'There was no potato famine ' <s> It is at this point that- in the words of Lynne Truss- 'I start making pointed harrumphing noises ' <s> I am pretty familiar with historical revisionists <s> I once visited the concentration camp at Dachau and the Lyndon Laroushe people had set up a table outside the gates <s> Clearly they had not been inside the gates because even if you wrote the facility off as an elaborate hoax you would at least have to wonder why anyone would put so much time and effort into staging it <s> I believe that wondering is only a short nudge from believing and what I saw at Dachau was beyond even the talents of Disney or George Lucas to contrive 'How can you say there was no potato famine Why would all the historians say there was one and why would all those Irish people have emigrated to American and wherever else 'There wasn 't really a famine <s> Yes the potato crop was smaller than usual but there would have been enough for the Irish if they were only supporting themselves <s> The problem is that the Irish were supposed to be supplying potatoes for all of England too <s> When the English arrived to pick up the potatoes the Irish people told them there weren 't enough and they couldn 't supply the English and feed themselves <s> The English then took all of the potatoes and the other crops too and the chickens and goats and children to use as slaves and their daughters and packed everything everyone off to England 'Okay 'So that is it <s> If the English had treated the Irish with respect and left them enough food to eat then there wouldn 't have been a famine at all 'Right 'I don 't get it <s> Everybody studies math and science and nobody studies philosophy <s> Why is that 'Because you don 't make any money with philosophy <s> We still live in a bottom-line type society <s> You make money by using math and science to invent or develop something <s> You don 't make money being nice to people and explaining to other people why they should be nice to each other 'I guess that is true <s> Do you think that is why there is such an emphasis on math and science 'I am probably not a good person to ask <s> When I was in elementary school we were all pushed as fast and as hard as we could be to learn math and science so we could defeat the Russians <s> Math science and chess 'Oh the old Space Race thing 'Yes and we weren 't going to beat the Russians by sitting around coming up with ways to be nice <s> And Bill Gates didn 't get to be a billionaire by thirty-one by being nice either <s> He made a billion dollars and then he started giving it away <s> Ethics and respect for other people are fine in personal relationships but I 've never heard of anyone using them to get ahead <s> You can be as kind and respectful as you want in your cardboard box under the bridge 'The conversation moved on then to why people don 't follow Bill and Ted is advice to 'Be excellent to each other 'and why nearly forty years after the attempted introduction of the metric system it still isn 't dominant in American society 'Umm because we 're Americans and we 're still a super-power so we 'll use any damned measurement system we like and to hell with what the rest of the world is doing 'was my take on the reason <s> In some ways I hate having those kinds of conversations with younger people <s> I always feel like I am letting them down and letting myself down as well <s> I understand that I am just presenting to them the facts as I 've experienced them Do I wish things were different You bet your sweet bippy I 'd love to buy the world a Coke and keep it company More and more frequently unless someone asks me specifically I just let them proceed in ignorance <s> Yes someone at some point is going to shake them by the scruff of the neck and tell them it is a dirty old world and most people would sell their mother or one of their children to make a buck or to get a carton of cigarettes <s> But I no longer think it is my job to do the shaking and I would rather do them the kindness of maintaining their innocence as long as possible <s> Relapse Sometimes when you 're suffering from an a 'iction it seems as if you 're the only one and it is kind of nice to find out you 're not <s> Maybe calling it an a 'iction is too strong <s> Maybe 'obsession 'would be better 'Affection 'isn 't big enough for the things I am going to be discussing <s> It is a good word for a phase you 'll grow out of like thinking life will end if you don 't end up married to Kevin Spacey Kevin Kline or Les <weirdcaps> Alan Rickman isn 't on that list because no matter how increasingly shabby he looks as Severus Snape he will always be entrancing in 'An Awfully Big Adventure ' People also don 't seem to grow out of their desire to own a lot of Sharpie pens <s> Once you have the regular thickness in all the different colors you can start on the ones with 'fine 'on one end and 'ultra fine 'on the other <s> Sometimes they make good souvenirs I once bought four of them at a stationery store at the beach and gave them to appropriate people along with their back-story Could we have bought the same ones at the Office Max here in town No <s> They would have been the same color but they wouldn 't have traveled three hours in a bag with a Cannon Beach sweatshirt and some salt water taffy and that makes all the difference It is hard to set someone on the path to Sharpie love though <s> You can give someone a Sharpie and they will either squee and their eyes will light up or they will say 'Oh <s> A marker 'and it is hard to tell which ahead of time <s> Another perennial favorite for unpredictable responses- I thought I had grown out of this one but apparently not- is fonts <s> Not fountains <s> Not those things they baptize babies and sometimes larger humans in <s> The typographic kind you find in books magazines and web designers ' caches <s> I have not designed in years therefore I had not come into contact with font collections online therefore I thought the danger was past <s> Then I read 'The Principles of Beautiful Web Design 'and there was a chapter on typography and even worse there were links <s> Now I have

't expected this to change any time soon <s> Girls tend to see me as one of the guys and guys tend to see me as one of the guys and that is okay <s> Whether it makes me one of the guys or not I love baseball <s> I don 't know when I started to love baseball <s> I was listening to an audiobook about Spenser and he was reciting the names of the Impossible Dream <date> Red Sox and they floated to the top layer of my brain like long-forgotten friends <s> I don 't know why my father would have been a Red Sox fan and I would only have been six-years-old when these guys played which makes it very

COPD so at this time I am purely a spectator and commentator And if people appear to be spectating with me I will talk to them about baseball <s> Anyone <s> And they only have to look like they 're the tiniest amount interested in the game <s> I offer as evidence the fact I once spent twenty minutes explaining to my mother about a ground-rule double <s> My mother is a a 70 year old woman b only remotely interested in sports and that goes double for baseball and c usually doing something else and listening to me purely because I am her offspring <s> Yesterday evening I attended the Vintage Baseball game held at the Fo rt on the field not too far from the gazebo <s> They play in the uniforms of and use the rules of the early <date> is <s> This means no bunting no sliding no stealing no called strikes no called balls so no walks and no gloves <s> Also the ball must be thrown underhand <s> I arrived at the field with my blanket and my sweatshirt rolled into a ball and was able to find a good seat even though there were a lot of people and the game had already started <s> I plopped down next to an old man- not being ageist <s> He was at least seventy-five <s> Not as elderly-looking as the seeming centenarian who later got hit by a foul ball but still old- who was sitting in one of those very short lawn chairs <s> I pulled out my <weirdcaps> started getting some pictures and trying to understand the rules <s> I am not sure if he talked to me first or if I talked to him first <s> I have feeling it was me and I asked him something like 'Do you think those bats are made of hickory 'My daughter had sent me a link to an article on why baseball bats break and it mentioned that in the early days the bats were made of hickory and since this was supposedly the early days I thought it was a reasonable question No I don 't know why I thought he might have an opinion <s> Maybe because he was an old man and they seem to have an opinion on everything except what they want for their next meal He said he thought they might be and we started talking about why bats break and how players like Ichiro who keep their bats in humidity controlled conditions don 't break their bats <s> And then we talked about baseball in general and how the Mariners are doing and whether they will turn out to be the reincarnation of the <date> Braves and how the Portland Beavers are doing and in between all this talking- which was spread over six innings- we sat in companionable silence that was only broken by exclamations of 'Nice hit 'or 'He batted from the other side of the plate last time <s> He might want to consider going back to it ' <s> The reader can easily gather from this bare-bones recounting of our interaction that nothing untoward was said by either the old man or me <s> There was nothing in fact that could not have been broadcast as 'color 'during this particular game had there been color announcers at that time or announcers of any kind <s> I had noticed that every so often the old man would exchange a remark or two with the old woman in the chair ahead of him <s> A lot of people were exchanging remarks with other people though and the two of them weren 't in matching chairs or anything so what happened around the mi 'le of the sixth inning came as a big surprise My mother claims it shouldn 't have but she wasn 't there so it is all supposition on her part What happened was that the people directly ahead of me had brought their two children and the kids got increasingly restless and the parents had already bribed them with soda and hot dogs and Cracker Jack and decided finishing the game wasn 't worth any further monetary investment <s> So they left <s> This was an awesome development for me because I now had an unobstructed view of the field even when I was sitting rather than kneeling <s> The parents and children leaving wasn 't a wholly unexpected event <s> The unexpected thing was when the old lady called over her shoulder in the manner of one of the wives on 'Last of the Summer Wine ' 'Well now that there is room <s> I suppose you could come up here and sit beside me 'No response from the old man <s> Presumably he was focusing on the game 'Did you hear me 'The old man is head slowly swiveled from the runner on second trying to decide whether he could make it to third once the ball was struck before the ball bounced 'What did you say 'A bit louder this time- 'Now that there is room I suppose you could come up here and sit beside me 'I suppose I could 'Yes <s> I suppose you could 'The old man moved up and as soon as he was settled in she left to get a hot dog <s> By now it was the seventh-inning stretch- no singing of course as that portion of the stretch hadn 't been inaugurated yet- and I went up to have a better look at some of the bats <s> Because the old man and I had been discussing them earlier I said to him as I walked by in search of my own hot dog 'He said his bats are made of white Ash wood and there was no weight limit but there was a circumference limit and the length limit was 42 ' <s> Can you imagine how tall you 'd have to be 'You 'd have to be a basketball player No limit for weight though 'No limit on what 'asked the old woman returned from her successful mission 'No limit on weight 'he said 'Hmm ishe said <s> It was very apparent now that I was the third wheel on a tandem although she was displaying as much interest in the whole topic as my mother had in the ground-rule double and I departed on a hot-dog recon of my own <s> When I came back to the game I sat facing the other side of the field <s> I hadn 't seen the action from over there and I thought it was the better part of valor even though it had never been my intention to cause trouble <s> But why was there going to be trouble I had no interest in hooking up with the old man <s> He was a nice enough old man with some good baseball stories to tell but even if I were looking for a sugar da 'y he didn 't look like he had the makings of one <s> And if I were an old woman I can 't imagine why I would be jealous of my old man talking to someone like me <s> No one would consider me trophy wife or girlfriend material <s> I hope the old man didn 't get in trouble <s> I hope he had a good time watching the game <s> And I hope this experience doesn 't put him off talking to other people <s> They could learn a lot from him <s> Even if all they talk about is baseball <s> Now I 've got the pill My doctor looked at me from under her straight-across black bangs her eyes serious behind her silver wire-framed glasses 'The fact is your cholesterol is sky-high my friend 'Yeah well I am cutting back on the cheese like the nurse said 'The doctor is hair swayed as she gave her head a quick shake 'Your cholesterol is so high I can tell there is no way you 're going to be able to bring it down with a low-fat diet <s> I am going to put you on Zocor 'Ah the old good news-bad news situation <s> The good news is since we 're not going to try to reduce the cholesterol by cutting the fat I can still enjoy cheese occasionally <s> The bad news is- with the exception of the mental anguish caused by contemplating a life without cheese - I was a lot more comfortable with the idea of lowering my LDL by diet and force of will than taking another pill <s> I am thankful that someone invented this pill and it is going to help prevent atherosclerosis and a possible heart attack <s> Don 't get me wrong about that <s> But I 've been a 'ing more and more pills to my life in the last few years and Zocor like Prozac is going to be something I am on for the foreseeable future In the interest of full-disclosure when I received my first prescription for Prozac two years ago I was extremely happy <s> It is goofy I know but I am very proud of my identity as a trailing Baby Boomer and in my mind having to take Prozac solidified my membership in that group <s> A doctor later diagnosed me as having an 'attachment disorder 'which essentially means I have a hard time accepting that we 're all getting older my child is going to go to college then off to start her own life my parents are eventually going to die and even more eventually so will I and the world will just continue on as if none of these events amounted to a hill of beans <s> Aside from personally finding this line of thought depressing as hell I think most Baby Boomers have suffered or are now suffering from some form of attachment disorder <s> Come on <s> The only way you can unironically say 'Never trust anyone over thirty 'is to ignore the fact that someday you 'll be there yourself Besides- and this is probably the crux of the issue- Zocor is something my pop takes <s> And he is diabetic <s> And seriously overweight <s> And seventy-one <s> What the hell am I doing having to take the same medication as him The short answer is it is his fault <s> Actually it is his parents ' fault <s> Okay it is probably their parents ' fault too <s> In other words I am one of those cholesterol from 'apple pie and Grandpa Si 'people just like in the commercial <s> Come to think of it most of the people on his side of the family suffered from some form of anxiety or depression too <s> As I look at the state he is in and consider whether his fate might be my own in twenty-five years it appears having an attachment

free-form My process varies <s> My thesis The Four Portlanders of the Apocalypse was highly planned <s> I spent months developing the concept taking photos of locations around Portland drawing and testing out the sizes of various elements on photocopiers <s> The finished designs were transferred to the blocks using carbon paper and then I carved all four concurrently <s> My current series the Iunges has been much more free-flowing <s> I start directly on the block spending time looking at the grain then sketching the outline of the Iunge <s> I make a few guidelines as the carving progresses but for the most part the details are not drawn out first <s> I 've found this technique very liberating since woodblock tends to be a very rigid medium <s> What do you enjoy most about printmaking I love being able to make two-dimensional art using three dimensional means <s> I 've always been more comfortable with mediums that require a certain amount of force and control <s> Metalsmithing was actually the focus of my education and taught me a great deal about precision <s> Ultimately though I found the prospect of making the same pieces of jewelry over and over again

Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh BFA <date> Currently teach printmaking one night a week at Pittsburgh Center for the Arts and run Norulak Screen Printing in Pittsburgh <s> How did you get started in printmaking Studied printmaking in college as a minor I was a painting major <s> Describe where you work <s> I do my etching work at Pittsburgh Center for the Arts where besides teaching I monitor the Wednesday night access studio <s> I do my screenprinting work at my shop usually when the commercial work slows down a bit <s> What is your favourite printmaking process Currently I 'd have to say etching <s> What is your creative process for any given print eg sketch first Pre-planned or free-form I use a photo-transfer process for my etchings <s> Starting with a photo which I 've taken I scan it and print it out on my laser printer then using a solvent transfer the toner from the paper to a zinc plate <s> The toner acts as a resist when the plate is etched in nitric acid <s> After the initial etch traditional etching techniques such as aquatint scraping and burnishing etc are used to complete the image <s> What do you enjoy most about printmaking I enjoy the mystery and surprises that come about from the indirectness of the process <s> Acid does what it will do and sometimes can 't be controlled <s> However you can change it after it is done its thing and mold it that way you want <s> What is your least favorite part of the process An image or a plate that refuses to work its way to completion <s> Happens sometimes <s> What are your inspirations other artists people places events etc I am a landscape artist and I am inspired by my visions of nature and how we humans have interacted with it and the effects of time and weather on natural and man-made objects <s> I 've been inspired by the prints of Whistler <s> He was known as kind of a rebel in his time <s> He was also the first printmaker to start signing his prints in pencil <s> How has your work changed and evolved since you started I like to think it is gotten better <s> But I think I 've evolved from a straight landscape artist to one that is making more of a statement about the natural environment as well <s> How do you get past creative slumps I get a bunch of plates and start beveling them <s> I usually try to have my next 5 to 10 images planned out in advance so I usually don 't have slumps <s> How do you promote your work I sell in galleries as well as online <s> I must admit the social networking phenomena has been helpful in getting the word out <s> I think teaching helps also I do a lot of demos and lectures for museums and art groups as well <s> Getting into juried shows also helps <s> Anything to get your work and name visible certainly can 't hurt <s> Any other comments or advice for others who want to try making hand-pulled prints Try starting with monotypes which is kind of a hybrid of painting and printmaking then venture into one of the other processes

central Indiana and attended college at Ball State University where I received a BFA in Graphic Design and a Masters in Painting <s> How did you get started in printmaking I took printmaking courses throughout college and was hooked at the start <s> I was introduced to German Expressionist prints early in my academic career and I still cannot get enough of the work absolutely powerful <s> Describe where you work <s> I work in my home studio <s> I like to be surrounded by my tools and be able to work on my artwork at any convenient moment <s> I print on a Dick Blick press which I love It is very empowering to own your own press and have the opportunity to print whenever you want What is your favorite printmaking process I really enjoy intaglio <s> There are so many techniques that can be utilized to create the final print <s> I enjoy charting a course on how I want my prints to look in the final stage and then implementing the steps to make it happen <s> It can be a very time consuming medium but is very much worth the effort in the end <s> What is your creative process for any given print eg sketch first Pre-planned or free-form I usually begin by writing down ideas that are inspired by a number of stimuli books nature people watching tv radio <s> I then develop my ideas in sketches to work out compositions and subject matter <s> I also sketch in pen and ink to practice my mark making which I then transfer to the copper plate <s> An attractive quality to printmaking is in the creation of multiples so I like to create series of works to further explore the multiple and cover my ideas from different angles <s> What do you enjoy most about printmaking Pulling the first print off the press is very exciting <s> Even though a plate has been worked over for several hours and you have a pretty good idea of what you may get there are always surprises revealed once the plate is inked and printed <s> It is really a magical moment <s> What is your least favorite part of the process The process of printing an edition of several impressions can be monotonous and time consuming <s> I am usually at my wits end after cleaning inking wiping and printing five impressions of the same image <s> At this point I walk away rest and approach the edition with fresh eyes because focus is needed to create a consistent edition <s> What are your inspirations other artists people places events etc Observation of urban and rural nature people video radio and reading books always provide inspiration <s> Visiting museums and reading about other artist is work and methods of production is also great for fueling the creative fire <s> How has your work changed and evolved since you started The quality of idea forming through observation and more playful execution of techniques has increased over the years which has really elevated my work to a more challenging place for me and hopefully the viewer <s> How do you get past creative slumps I recognize them and enjoy them <s> I try to avoid being frustrated and understand that the well will once again fill up <s> I find these to be great times to look at other artists work or just take a break and not think about art-making at all <s> How do you promote your work I just recently started selling my work on Etsy I have a website which features my finished works and a blog that I update with sketches and works in progress <s> I enter competitions once or twice a year and have gallery shows about once every couple of years <s> Any other comments or advice for others who want to try making hand-pulled prints Printmaking can be accomplished with limited means <s> There are several books out there that illustrate great printmaking techniques that can be accomplished with a few household tools <s> There is no excuse for not printing The best thing about prints are the multiples that you can trade for other artist is works If you could curate a museum show of a printmaker who would you exhibit I would love to curate a comprehensive exhibition of Goya is prints <s> The show would include various states of specific prints if they exist and original plates tools and a reproduction of a press that he may have used <s> Oh yes and there would be printmaking demonstrations throughout the duration of the exhibition <s> What printastic museum would you recommend other printmakers to visit THE REMBRANDT HOUSE MUSEUM They have the MOST comprehensive collection of Rembrandt prints <s> The house which Rembrandt owned for many years has been restored to reflect how Rembrandt lived in it in the 17th century <s> It is a remarkable experience <s> The Rembrandt House Museum Jodenbreestraat 4 <date> NK Amsterdam The Netherlands Delicious Chicken by kelokeefe Original Etching - Steampunk

Rover the Smithsonian and Seventeen Magazine helping to grow market share increase revenue and adapt to the ever-changing realities of the digital age <s> But we all know what they say about 'all work and no play 'In my spare time I explore a variety of creative pursuits including cooking writing photography and printmaking <s> For more than three years I assisted classically-trained chefs in teaching recreational cooking classes at L 'academie de Cuisine in Bethesda MD <s> I 've also co-authored a number of books and articles on topics ranging from online pricing and distribution models in the music industry to business use of technology contemporary American politics travel and product development <s> For th e past few years I 've worked with artists at Washington is Corcoran College of Art Design to explore photography typography and graphic design printmaking and drawing <s> I 've earned a BA in Political Science and Spanish Language Literature from the George Washington University and an MA in Communications from Georgetown University <s> HOW DID YOU GET STARTED IN PRINTMAKING Almost completely by chance actually <s> I 've worked in advertising for a long time and have been fortunate to work with extremely talented copywriters designers producers and programmers <s> The bulk of my experience is in creating interactive and print campaigns and products for hospitality travel automotive and consumer products companies in the <smiley> and Europe <s> And while I 've always been co mfortable collaborating with brand managers and market researchers and account executives I 've often felt that working with my design teams was harder than it needed to be <s> I am not sure if this was due to my lack of hands-on design experience not sharing the same vocabulary some fundamental gap between left-brain and right-brain personalities <s> But as the guy ultimately responsible for the quality of our work I was determined to find a way to improve my interaction with my designers <s> My approach was to take classes at the Corcoran College of Art Design everything from Photoshop and <weirdcaps> to drawing photography lighting design for interiors and graphic design <s> A few years back I replaced a can celed class with screenprinting and was absolutely amazed by the powerful emotional and physical connection I felt in the studio <s> The physicality of the process infinite opportunities to follow traditional techniques or to experiment with new approaches the joy of creating multiples it all had me hooked right from the start <s> DESCRIBE WHERE YOU WORK The bulk of my printing happens in the print studio at the Corcoran which is in the basement of a really old former public school building in DC <s> It is a great space to learn the basics <s> It is on the smaller side so you learn quickly how to work in close quarters with other printers how to move carefully between printers as you carry your prints to the rack how to be aware of those moving around you with prints or pots of ink or the random sharp pointy object <s> Our equipment is anything but fancy wood and aluminum screens clamped to work tables no cool vacuum tables or anything like that <s> And it certainly isn 't new our racks and floors and tables and washout room are layered with spots and smears of ink scratches rust dents a subtle reminder that there is history all around us the collective creativity and sweat and effort of all the students and masters who 've printed before us <s> T hat makes the space inspiring and as cramped and frustrating as it can be it feel s like home <s> WHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE PRINTMAKING PROCESS Screenprinting definitely <s> I studied intaglio many years ago with master printer Scip Barnhart which was really a great experience <s> But as much as I enjoyed the process it is so much slower than screenprinting <s> And much more dependent on my ability to draw which is probably one of my least-developed skills <s> So while I enjoy it most of my intaglio work would probably be stick figures interacting with other stick figures <s> Screenprinting on the other hand well that is a whole different ballgame <s> My creative process for screenprinting is fueled in so many ways by my photography through abstract designs or compositions in Photoshop or Illustrator or more traditionally through non-digital processes <s> I am able to envision an d create much more effectively and I think at a higher level through screenprinting than I would with any other process <s> WHAT 'S YOUR CREATIVE PROCESS FOR ANY GIVEN PRINT EG <s> SKETCH FIRST PRE-PLANNED OR FREE-FORM My best prints - or at least the ones I feel are the most successful - start out from my photographs <s> I try to travel to interesting places though recently thanks economy those places have been much closer to home <s> P laces like Philadelphia shooting well-known but very interesting places l ike Eastern State Penitentiary or Smith Island Maryland which is home of the many-layered Smith Island Cake <s> I 'll even drive for hours and hours to places like Centralia PA which is what is left of an entire town destroyed by a coal mine fire <s> Places with history with a unique story with some kind of beauty and meaning <s> I then pul l everything into Photoshop or Illustrator to experiment with texture tone balance all the little t weaks needed to pull together an exciting composition <s> Sometimes there is a lot of manipulation involved as with my print 'El Gran Gallo ' where the original photograph is substantially transformed into a graphic print <s> Other times the digital work is very minimal as with ' Gull ' where Photoshop was used merely to create CMYK separations the print clearly reflecting its photographic origins <s> Finally it is into the studio where I try to challenge mysel f with each new project working with new color palettes techniques that are new and unusual or sizes or aspect ratios that I haven 't worked with before <s> WHAT DO YOU ENJOY MOST ABOUT PRINTMAKING The night before I go into the studio I 'll spend some time doing a mental walk-through of my battle plan about everything that needs to be done about the best timing order where things can go wrong <s> I try to anticipate problems and how to keep them from happening <s> So by the time I get into the studio I have a fairly good idea of what needs to happen when and how I can act and react if anything funky happens <s> What I love about printmaking then is when I get into the studio and the day unfolds much like I 've visualized it <s> I am in the zone everything is breaking my way <s> My film looks just like I want it the emulsion isn 't too old and is holding the detail of my images nicely <s> There is plenty of room to work I am getting my inks together without much hassle <s> And when the printing begins it is almost on automatic pour flood drop pull lift flood repeat <s> I spin gingerly on one foot and carry my prints to the rack the other printers in the studio moving deftly aside as I scoot by <s> There is a harmony a synchronicity between us <s> My head is down I am doing good work the rhythm and pacing are spot on <s> Can 't get enough of that feeling <s> WHAT 'S YOUR LEAST FAVORITE PART OF THE PROCESS I hate picking colors for my prints <s> I am woefully unschooled in color theory though I do generally know a good color combination when I see one <s> But my knowledge and skill in this area are very rough unrefined <s> I am certainly not delicate when it comes to color and often default to bold colors because I just don 't trust myself outside of this comfort zone <s> I 've been aching to take a color theory class for years but haven 't had any luck so far <s> Fortunately my instructors Manuel Navarette and Carolyn Hartmann have been extremely gracious in sharing little color theory insights with me suggesting better combinations or directions for particular projects <s> But I 'd very much l ike to take color theory so I can embrace this part of the process more fully make it more my own <s> WHAT ARE YOUR INSPIRATIONS OTHER ARTISTS PEOPLE PLACES EVENTS ETC In the last 15 years or so there are three artists who have really inspired me to embrace artistic pursuits <s> First is Scip Barnhart my intaglio instructor who gave me my first taste of the technical skill and creative processes required to create something meaningful beautiful fulfilling <s> More recently are two New Orleans artists Matt Rinard and Robert Guthrie <s> I 've been collecting their work for years and have been surrounded at home by their prints and originals and bits of sculpture <s> Each time I catch a glimpse of their work some little emotional part of me think s fondly of New Orleans and an overwhelming sense of happiness wash es over me <s> L et me make it clear that I am absolutely in no way comparing my work to the awesomeness these guys create but knowing how happy their art makes me I thought it would be really amazingly cool to see if I could find something within m e some creativity some passion that could give a bit of that happiness to others <s> And it goes without saying that I 'd be absolutely nowhere in any of this without the attention support and dedication of my instructors Carolyn and Manuel <s> HOW HAS YOUR WORK CHANGED AND EVOLVED SINCE YOU STARTED It is important to understand that when I walked into the studio that very first day I had absolutely no idea what I was getting into <s> None <s> Yeah I 'd had that intaglio experience with Scip years earlier but wow such a different process diff erent tools different mindset <s> So I was really starting from scratch <s> My first year or so was spent focused on the basics developing the muscle memory of the right way to pull the squeegee across my screen developing a fluidity of movement in my personal printing process becoming familiar with the temperament of the inks and acrylic base how they change based on environmental circumstances how to coax them into doing what I want them to do with a little bit of airbrush cleaner <s> My prints in this time were very traditional straightforward examples pretty much just ink on paper <s> But throughout that first year I did two important things <s> First I asked questions a lot of questions <s> I am sure I drove my instructors a little nuts <s> Second I searched bookstores and galleries and the internet for more information on screenprinting but also generally about all types of printmaking <s> So over the course of that year I learned for example about metallic powders and glass beads and me coflock and the use of adhesives <s> I learned about very interesting techniques using wax and oil paint to a d d depth and dimension to my prints <s> I discovered how important it can be to pick the right paper for an edition because some papers simply won 't accommodate an artist is vision for a particular project <s> I also developed a sense of the projects I should and shouldn 't be tackling <s> My dad was an artist and I thought it would be a neat homage to his work to create a print of one of his paintings <s> It was hard as hell to be honest <s> Not only technically because perhaps my skills with Photoshop and as a printmaker weren 't quite yet up to that level of reproduction but also emotionally because I was putting lots of pressure on myself to do justice to the original piece <s> A ' to that some difficulties with new inks that I was using and a few other hiccups and we had the recipe for one spectacular colossal failure <s> I still think it is a good idea to challenge yourself obviously but perhaps I 'd piled on too many expectations too much pressure <s> I 've found that I work better and am much more satisfied when I am focused on my personal vision for my pieces with their genesis in my photography or drawing or whatnot because I only need to be true to myself my vision my creativity <s> In the past few years all of this learning experimentation successes and failures have definitely influenced my work changed it I think for the better <s> As much as I still love the straightforward ink-on-paper approach I 've also embraced some less traditional processes <s> Images that are c on c ealed by 15 or more layers of multi-colored inks then sanded to carefully reveal parts of the obscured subject <s> Images printed in clear acrylic base with acrylic glazes or wax and oil paints used to provide color depth dimension <s> All this experimentation comes at a price though <s> If I 'd been sticking to simpler projects using more basic skills I 'd have a much broader deeper portfolio by now <s> Instead I have a handful of finished editions that I love combined with drawers and portfolios full of pieces in various stages of completion waiting to be sanded waiting for an epiphany to recover from an experimental misstep pieces that I am just not sure how to finish <s> I am okay with that trade-off because it is my belief that I need to spend a whole bunch of years up front working on technique so that later on I can print larger editions more complicated editions flawlessly and with relative ease <s> HOW DO YOU GET PAST CREATIVE SLUMPS Check back with me in a few years I am still trying to figure that out I 've definitely hit a few walls so far <s> One way I 've attacked t he problem of becoming frustrated with my skills development is by changing instructors <s> Which is absolutely not a knock on one instructor or another but I think it is important to learn from different people to be pushed and encouraged and challenged by people with unique perspectives paths approaches <s> When I get stuck creatively in terms of what I am going to do next it is sometimes good to just be in the studio printing even if I am not working on my next masterpiece <s> Because I have a day job my studio time is very limited <s> And I often find myself trying to maximize my productivity by printing complicated pieces sometimes with funky techniques or levels of detail that maybe maybe I shouldn 't be embracing quite yet <s> And when things don 't work out exactly as I 'd planned I am especially hard on myself <s> So lots of practice especially with less meaningful subject matter is key <s> Get in the studio and just print some squares or squiggles but aim to make all the right choices paper composition colors technique bringing everything together so you print the best darn squiggles you can <s> HOW DO YOU PROMOTE YOUR WORK I am just st arting to figure that out <s> Like I said most of my best prints start out as my photographs 'El Gran Gallo 'is an interpretation of a picture I made of a rooster at the Great Frederick Fair in Frederick MD which lent itself to a particularly cool transformation into a graphic print <s> But sometimes my photos just need to live as photos <s> So if you visit my E tsy shop or flickr photostream you 'll see I have photos as well as prints available <s> My approach so far has been very basic have a bit of a presence on my personal site post photos and prints to flickr and to lots of flickr groups and try selling some pieces on E tsy <s> It is frustrating I don 't yet have a good sense of where best to promote my work or how to best price my photos and prints <s> I don 't want to overcharge but I also don 't want to low-ball <s> After all camera lenses and studio time don 't come cheap <s> Other printmakers at my studio say they 've had good success on <weirdcaps> but honestly a <math> cut of a sale seems a little excessive to me <s> Maybe that is penny-wise and pound-foolish I don 't know <s> I am also starting to explore print exchanges and submitting my work to shows but I don 't yet have a sense of the return that will have for me <s> Right now I am just throw ing everything against the wall to see what sticks <s> ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR ADVICE FOR OTHERS WHO WANT TO TRY MAKING HAND-PULLED PRINTS Trust your gut <s> Whether it is screenprinting or intaglio or litho you 're going to know when you 've found a process that is a good fit for you <s> Struggling is part of the technical and creative learning process so you shouldn 't use a little difficulty up front as an excuse to give up <s> But there is certainly a difference between becoming proficient with a particular process and discovering you have a passion for it <s> Un Problemo Granda by fattybird Familiarity - original silkscreen print by estasketch Untitled - Original Mezzotint Print by

endings nbsp turn sour and my mild obsessive tendencies came to surface <s> The story actually begins on February 19th when I came across some incredible Raw Zucchini Chips featured on the blog Green and Crunchy <s> They were beautiful crispy crunchy little discs <s> By far a perfect substitution for Lays or Pringles any day <s> Life moved forward as it does so often and I quickly forgot about the little bits of heaven at least until I saw Bitt of Raw is posting of Zucchini Chips and her cute dog eating raw zucchini <s> Adorable <s> Zucchini chips were not going away any time soon thus the seeds of my obsession was firmly planted in my brain <s> I went to The Complete Book of Raw Food you know my endeavor and all searching for a recipe comparable to what I had read on the blogs <s> I found what I was seeking on page <date> Shazzie is recipe for Curly Crisps <s> On the surface everything seemed to be moving in the right direction <s> I had a cool hand-held mandoline a few small zucchini a beet and a couple of plump light green stubby things called Mexican Squash <s> Using my cool hand-held mandoline I sliced the vegetables into thin rounds a shy away from being paper thin but not quite <s> I choose a variety of basic seasonings including garlic onion wasabi and barbecue powders nothing too spectacular or out of the ordinary nbsp Well maybe the wasabi but nbsp I digress <s> My first batch I placed in the dehydrator for <date> degrees for about 12 hours <s> The edges of my produce curled taking on a slight crispiness but nothing compared to potato chips <s> The mi 'le of the vegetable discs were something less to be desired <s> They were soft and pliable resembling nothing like a chip <s> I popped them back in the dehydrator for another few hours <s> Nothing changed except the size of my zucchini chips they shrank <s> This whole process continued over the course of a week <s> Attempting varying sizes and thinness of different root vegetables with Teflex sheet without Teflex sheet with salt without salt with oil without oil <s> Good eatable food was thrown in the compost bucket because they weren 't crisp enough <s> I was relentless Man on the Raw was impatient with my compulsive slightly psychotic behavior <s> But I couldn 't help it <s> I wanted a crispy crunchy chip and I was bound and determined to create one <s> Finally I received a reprieve <s> I had a promising batch of zucchini and beet chips on Sunday <s> They came from the dehydrator after 30 hours at <date> degrees and they were actually a good crunchy consistency nbsp Success the girls enjoyed them and I finally had something the Man on the Raw could give his seal of approval on and he wouldn 't have to send me away to a psych ward <s> That was the case until the girls ate most of them and the ones that remained were left uncovered and I suppose the moisture from the Colorado air yeah right turned them back to a soft pliable chip taking on the texture of a mildly waterlogged potato chip <s> Of course when Man on the Raw came home after an exhausting evening of work he wasn 't in the correct frame of mind to believe me when I told him my chips were nbsp crispy at one point in their life <s> He just kind of heaved a sigh and his chin sank to the ground <s> I bite down on the side of my lip and nbsp quickly promised I wouldn 't attempt another batch of vegetable chips until I ended my juice feast and I was able to taste test nbsp them myself <s> Recipes number <date> of The Complete Raw Food Endeavor 1 <s> One thing the world doesn 't know about me

<s> A few weeks ago Bonnie the more exciteable of the two puppies charged at me in all her enthusiasm and bashed me in the nose <s> It bloody hurt <s> Enough that for the past few weeks I have been taking pain killers and nursing a very sore and tender nose <s> However me being me I thought 'it can 't possibly be Bonnie is fault 'and so I decided I had sinusitis Stop laughing at the back nbsp Having never had it before I scoured the Internet for symptoms of which pretty much boiled down to the ones I had <s> Except today I couldn 't stand it any longer and thought it best to see the doctor <s> So off I trudged to his little TARDIS in the next village and let him have a right good look up my hooter <s> Pro 'ing and pressing feeling and caressing asking me about snot and things on my hankie he confirmed that my sinuses are absolutely fine 'Have you knocked it recently 'he asked 'Oh well one of my puppies did a bit since 'I answered nbsp Some more feeling took place before he gave his final diagnosis 'You 've broken your nose 'he said <s> He explained how the bones and bits inside work and everything started making sense <s> It is slightly swollen but is now on the mend and apparently re-setting itself <s> And it still bloody hurts And moving swiftly on Amy drew out five names from her isee you Jimmy 'hat nbsp I will contact each one of you and ask for your a 'ress so that I can send a copy of my childrens book to you nbsp Here is the Vlog we did which shows Amy drawing the names from the hat nbsp If you didn 't win a copy but would like to receive one you can always buy one here nbsp Thank you for all your comments and for taking part in my little competition <s> What do you say to them when you realise that whatever you do say might not be understood nbsp Or will be more times than not a waste of time and will make you feel worse than you probably do already nbsp Those beautiful malteser eyes stare up at me with huge great tears just bursting with volcanic resemblence and I am supposed to decide in a split second whether this is an age issue or one of autistic trait <s> Last week I lost the plot nbsp I guess sometimes even mums are allowed to have a tantrum and that was what I did nbsp The door took most of it but I must have looked like a mad woman completely crazed by a child is rudeness nbsp I couldn 't cry nbsp Tears wouldn 't come to the surface even though I was sobbing inside nbsp I knew having a tantrum in front of my autistic daughter was the worst thing I could have done and I am still reliving it seven days later when she tells me how crazy I was nbsp But then the inevitable happened word from elsewhere that Amy had been telling her friends about our little tete-a-tete nbsp I was wrong to do what I did I am usually calm and walk away from a situation where I know I cannot win but just occasionally that little wire snaps and bingo nbsp I am a gonna <s> Of course things calmed down within the hour but I spent a few days beating myself up thinking of new ways to tackle the issues which no doubt surround adolescence nbsp But what is not easy to get a handle on is adolescence vs autism nbsp As yet I do not know exactly what the next twelve months will bring let alone the next five years of which I am sure will be just as hard for Amy as it will for me nbsp The school are helping as is the school nurse but right now support is very thin on the ground nbsp And that I am sorry to say is nothing new p s <s> Book giveaway draw will take place either tomorrow or Wednesday am trying to persuade reluctant child to help with filming it Something amazing happened yesterday nbsp I knew at the beginning of the week that I was nearing the end of my novel the one I have been writing on and off for the past two years nbsp The one in which I have fictionalised my own paranormal experiences seeing them through Camilla is eyes nbsp I have lived her life thought her thoughts created her from my own imagination nbsp I have felt as if I owned her as if she answered only to me nbsp I have visualised actors playing the parts of characters Martin Shaw as the Reverand Oakley Robson Green as Michael all verging on a complete fantasy of which I have seen played out before my eyes <s> But yesterday I realised that I had reached the light which marked the end of my work in progress nbsp I had said everything that needed to be said got to the point where stretching out the novel for the sake of length would have been wrong and most likely spoilt the whole effect nbsp And so I closed the file and finished it nbsp I haven 't typed the words 'The End 'because I am sure there will be much to a ' and too much to subtract nbsp I have put my little memory sticks on which the book is saved into a drawer and locked it nbsp After the lambing I will open that drawer and begin the editing process which I know will be hard but will mean another step nearer to presenting it for potential publication nbsp I suspect finding a publisher will be the most difficult part but for now I shall enjoy achieving my goal of writing my paranormal novel <s> And so in order to celebrate this achievement I am giving away three copies of a children is book which I wrote myself and self-published nbsp The book Adventures at Aaron Loch Farm is a compilation of children is stories which I wrote a few years ago nbsp It is nothing fancy but all my own work including the book cover picture nbsp But I am proud of it because it was the first book I had published albeit by myself nbsp I shall write all commenters names on a separate piece of paper then ask Amy to draw out three at random nbsp I am more than happy to post anywhere in the world nbsp And if I get lots of comments I shall increase this giveaway to five copies but if you would rather not receive a copy and you still want to leave a comment just say I won 't in the least bit be offended nbsp You know me I love my comments nbsp CJ <smiley> We had one of those unforgettable family afternoons on Sunday nbsp The sky was blue few clouds scattered in recognisable shapes a distant micro-glider buzzing above the barley fields nbsp The Farmer was sawing down hedges keeping himself busy in the Spring sun whilst Amy and I played hide and seek her idea mine was to sit down and play a board game nbsp One of Amy is hiding places was behind the greenhouse made of glass <s> I had no problem finding her on that occasion <s> We decided to join the Farmer in the end walking down the field to be greeted by 4 excited collies bounding towards us nbsp I couldn 't miss the opportunity of taking the camera and the camcorder so here is a little vlog snippet for you it is only a minute in length without my ugly mug so quite safe to watch <s> A long time ago when I lived in the South East I did some contract work for the Crown Prosecution Service a very interesting job but one I couldn 't have undertaken as a permanent post nbsp I saw many harrowing files witnessed cases being brought to court and even sat in on a murder trial to assist one of the law clerks nbsp It was pressure all the way and even though I was young married to my first husband with no children I just wasn 't cut out for the responsibility in which the job demanded nbsp Unfortunately I made few friends and was quite relieved once my contract came to an end lucky enough to find a permanent job not long after at Rothmans where I did make friends and felt much more at ease nbsp But even though my temporary post at the CPS didn 't work out I have always been interested in law attending college to get the Institute of Export qualification thus making my job at Rothmans more successful <s> Now I find myself asking a question as a defence lawyer knowing your client is guilty with strong evidence to prove it how would you defend them nbsp You have a murderer or the like standing in the witness box having just sworn on the bible and refusing to accept responsibility for their actions yet the lawyer knows otherwise nbsp Does the lawyer get his client off and risk that person being back on the streets to murder again nbsp What is classed as winning a case so far as the defence team are concerned nbsp When I was a little girl I used to love visiting my grandma nbsp She lived in a 3 bedroom <date> is semi on the outskirts of a small town nbsp The house also had a large back garden seeming much bigger when I was a child nbsp We always used the back door which opened into a little porch or lean-to as is sometimes known which went straight into a small kitchen nbsp I remember the units being similar to the ones we used to have in the farm house kitchen before it was renovated nbsp Two doors in the kitchen one leading into the back room which was used most of the time and the other going into the front room a large sitting room with a sideboard gramophone and a few other pieces of furniture of which I can 't quite recall nbsp I do remember however the photographs of which grandma had on display sitting proudly in their frames on the sideboard <s> I used to love this room I would spend most of our visits playing on my own with the brass ornaments grandma had on the fireplace nbsp I often got told not to touch but you know what kids are like nbsp But I was always so proud of the baby photo I used to stare at it and ask my mum to tell me what I was like as a baby <s> The reason why I look so chubby was because my parents left me with my auntie for two weeks not long before it was taken nbsp My dad had to go to Germany on business and mum decided to go with him taking my almost 4 year old brother with them nbsp When they returned they were shocked to see me as I lay in my pram the only explanation being my auntie had fed me on bananas for the whole duration <s> Having been <repeatedchars> the baton by Trish of Mum is Gone To I now proudly present it to my taggee who can be found here nbsp This is a picture of the person in question a little clue for you on the photograph <s> No matter how many times we wish we had the better option we are always able to make do with what we have nbsp I have learnt over the years that the challenges and obstacles of which I have been faced with have not been bestowed on me because I couldn 't cope nbsp We go through many testing times throughout our existence some of us are faced with more than others but these are only times which we can deal with only tests in which we will eventually pass <s> We need people in our lives to help us cope with the days that we wish our parallel universe was a little nearer to reality nbsp It isn 't easy sailing through life having nothing to worry about and that is something most of us will never experience nbsp I worry if I haven 't got something to worry about nbsp The responsibilities we take on during the course of our lives are often so great that it isn 't uncommon for one to feel we are in it way over our heads incapable of getting through a day <s> Life is a precious gift imagine how incredible it would be if there were two of us nbsp A parallel existence in another universe could be all the things we always wanted to be it could do everything we planned to do visit all the places we want to see have the perfect job live in a perfect house nbsp Even though this wouldn 't be reality what would you want for your life in a parallel world nbsp Putting aside your contentment in this life imagining you could choose another You <s> I had Amy is statement of special education needs review recently <s> The first one at her new school <s> I came away with a spring in my step totally in awe at the incredibly keen interest of which the school have taken towards her welfare <s> They can 't do enough for her ensuring she gets the maximum enjoyment and educational support she possibly can <s> I had my report to submit along with reports from the school and her communications officer <s> And what I found comforting was the fact that we are all on the same wavelength <s> No 'ing heads and lots of 'yes absolutely is and I felt good inside <s> Amy is growing up and the school are acknowledging that head on <s> As you know she has started doing life skills which comprise of swimming helping at another school cookery and soon to be helping at a library and possibly a nursery <s> The nursery arrangement concerned me a little due to Amy is difficulties in dealing with younger children she gets very aggressive towards them but the school once more came up trumps and ensured me she would be observed and supervised at all times <s> The current statement stipulates 26 hours support per week but the authorities were suggesting that this be reduced to 20 hours as from 1st April <s> The school are in total disagreement with this plan and are insisting that 26 hours remains if not to be increased <s> I was almost jumping up and down with thanks <s> It is so important that Amy doesn 't lose any hours because as the school agreed the reason why she has been doing so well at mi 'le school is because she has a good level of support <s> But it is all about funding <s> People don 't matter anymore and that is what we need to change

and one which may be assigned to a specific place in the psychic activities of the waking state 'I do believe there is a scientific reason for our dreams <s> But why for goodness sake was I dreaming about David Duchovny The truth is out there <s> Yesterday I had the opportunity to see the movie 'Precious ' and apart from being the most disturbing movie I have ever seen it also opened a window to

am only slightly younger than Methuselah and it traumatized me <s> I had definite mixed feelings about the film and about Gabourey Sidibe is performance <s> She was perfectly cast in the role but it was obvious she had not had much acting experience <s> In most of her scenes I had difficulty hearing what she was saying <s> She seemed to do what most new actors do -- she spoke a little too quickly and she mumbled <s> Only in her voice-overs was I able to clearly hear her <s> I wanted to love her performance but I didn 't <s> I loved her character though and Precious is a true hero overcoming almost insurmountable o is <s> The film was produced by Oprah Winfrey and Tyler Perry and directed by Lee Daniels <s> A reviewer by the name of Armond White who writes for the New York Press had this to say 'Winfrey Perry and Daniels make an unholy triumvirate <s> They come together at some intersection of race exploitation and opportunism 'Another reviewer called the movie 'Social pornography at its worst festering in racial self-loathing and oblivious to a system that ignores its neediest 'I felt that way too but I think the movie touched a chord with Oprah because it must have felt slightly

not easily manipulated and it kind of ruins the fun <s> As one reviewer said about the movie 'Precious ' 'There is a thin line between compassion and voyeurism soul-searing drama and overwrought

by the kind of blue waters that you think only Photoshop or Koolaid mix can create <s> The stone beaches are like bleacher seating for the beautifully tanned and Speedo-clad bodies that lie on them all day every day <s> And everything smells like lavender <s> Hvar is famous for it is lavender products and they are sold everywhere resulting in the lingering scent that is strong enough to even win out over the sea of cigarette smoking tanners <s> This town is apparently THE place to be for the month of August and with no planning on my part I find myself in the heart of Europe is biggest summer

English <s> Part of the real beauty here is that there are islands everywhere <s> The vistas are dotted with tiny rocky outcrops just big enough for a channel marker up to large mountainous landmasses shaped like a young child would draw a plump-petalled flower the spaces in between the petals each in fact a secluded bay with safe anchorages and heavenly bath water swimming holes <s> The island of Hvar is the biggest one around and I wanted to do some exploring so a few days ago I rented a car <s> Because it is prime season here I was limited to only one option for a car <s> A first generation <smiley> Beetle painted in sparkly purple and adorned with gold flames and a lions head <s> Seriously this was my rental <s> Now of course I acknowledge that this car was three decades past its prime <s> Anti-lock brakes power steering a radio these were of course luxuries I could not expect to have but there was more missing from the standard line-up of generally expected auto accessories <s> Upon being given the keys I was warned by the rental guy that I should probably go straight to the gas station as 'the fuel gauge doesn 't work so who could know how much petrol is in the tank ' While approaching the gas station I figured out that braking was not a given either <s> Thankfully it was a manual and I know how to downshift so no huge problem however it should be noted that to engage the clutch it was helpful if you could regularly leg press <date> kilos <s> Also no seat belt not a huge problem since the human Velcro effect of sweaty skin on pleather made me feel secure in my oneness with this vehicle no roof no way to adjust the position of the seat which was way too close to the rally-car after-market pedals and steering wheel and most problematically it would turn out no lights <s> At the petrol station I had a momentary hesitation where I realized that this car and I use that term loosely was perhaps not going to make for a fun day and that if I were wise I would return it and reserve a real manufactured in this century car for another day <s> Of course I put this absurd thought out of my head and headed off for points unknown <s> First stop Stari Grad or translated Old Town a well-earned name as the place was founded way back in <date> BC <s> Here I strolled around snapping photos of various architectural features and stopping for a perfect breakfast <s> I am a big fan of breakfast in fact it is my favorite meal of the day <s> Back when I had a normal ' life going out with friends for a leisurely weekend breakfast was something I truly looked forward to every week <s> As I travel breakfast is often my longest and largest meal of the day <s> So I fancy myself a bit of an expert on this building block of nutrition <s> In Stari Grad I had a plate of perfectly fried eggs topped with homemade cheese and local sea salt served with a fresh from the oven baguette and the ripest tomatoes I may have ever eaten <s> This breakfast masterpiece was accompanied by a perfectly crafted cappuccino and it was by far the best meal I have had here <s> I figured I was off to a great start and that my day would thus be assured fabulousness <s> There are a couple other towns near Stari Grad that I had already visited so I decided to pass them by to get into new territory on the island <s> The lack of braking capacity on the <smiley> started to concern me as the road left the oceanside and started inclining rapidly <s> As I wound round and round and up and up I started getting a tad nervous about my return trip as this was the only road available for both the outgoing and incoming journey <s> Here is where my FOMS kicked in <s> FOMS Fear Of Missing Something is a term coined by my friend Bob Daniels of Durango Colorado and it aptly describes my normal state of propulsion <s> So as the same little voice in my head that had though perhaps I should return this grape colored lemon of a car was saying to me Um Rach Do you really want to descend this mountain in second gear relying on what little remains of this things transmission to slow your plummet to the sea I kept crawling higher and higher afraid I could be missing something amazing up ahead <s> Finally at a vista point I saw my future more up and therefore more steep downs to come <s> I gave in to better judgment and turned around <s> I did stay in second gear the whole time and by about the 20th switchback I figured out that the bailing wire and duct-taped lever dangling below the steering wheel was in fact the horn which a 'ed an air of safety to my entering the blind corners <s> Back at sea level I decided to head west instead of south <s> West was less mountainous looking so it seemed a safer bet <s> A few kilometers in and the western road started climbing as well but soon enough I got to a tunnel which thankfully went through rather than over the mountains <s> As it turns out this tunnel was carved by a crack-pot force of I am guessing sugar-high Oompah Loompas <s> I say this because the tunnel was very short and narrow it wound up and down as well as side to side and it was pitch black <s> Like can 't see your hand in front of your face ink black <s> The tunnel is a one-way affair so cars queue up and wait for the entrance light to turn green gaining them entry into this very long and winding roadway <s> About <date> feet into the tunnel and I realized I should turn on my lights as I fumbled with dials and levers the cars in front of me sped away leaving me with no way to see what was ahead of me or for that matter next to me above or below me <s> No matter the combination of switches levers or buttons I pressed no lights came on not so much as a blinker <s> I navigated that tunnel solely on sonar and the very infrequent flickering of headlights from the <smiley> barreling down on me <s> If I could have found my purse and used my <weirdcaps> flashlight app I would have this would have been a miracle <s> The 60 seconds or so that it took me to navigate that ink black birth canal of engineering mediocrity were among the most terrifying of my life <s> When I emerged on the other side I parked the car and got out to verify that I was still alive and that this hadn 't been some rabbit hole into oblivion for me <s> The worst part of course was that I would have to go back through the tunnel because again there was only one road <s> This is when the novelty of the aubergine-colored bedazzled bug fully wore off <s> I was spent fried frazzled and seriously considering abandoning this thing right there at the mouth of the tunnel <s> I managed to pull it together enough to drive down into the next town where again I got out to test the steadiness of my legs and to try every <weirdcaps> trick in the book to get a light on this car to work <s> Finally I figured out that if I pulled out all the buttons and simultaneously pulled the windshield wiper lever forwards and down the driving lights would work this was confirmed by a kindly gentleman in a brand new Audi who upon confirming that I had about a 30 watt bulb to get me through the tunnel wisely sped off to avoid the likely coming fiery crash <s> This is how I made my return passage one shaky hand on the wheel and the other white-knuckled onto the lever and my dying flashlights of headlights blazing about a two foot path in front of me <s> When I got back on the safe side of that pit of despair I said aloud to myself I need a drink ' <s> Now this is a phrase I try to avoid using <s> My alcohol consumption has a long-history of binge and purge periods a fact that at times makes me think I should reevaluate my relationship with fermented spirits <s> So if the word need enters into an alcohol-related conversation especially a one-participant conversation such as this one I see this as cause for reflection <s> However in this instance I approve <date> of the usage of this phrase and I affirm that I really did NEED a drink <s> Sadly or maybe not there was no place around to get one so I just kept driving <s> I abandoned my silly idea of exploring new parts of the island and went promptly to Vrboska <s> I had visited this amazingly charming town a few days before via the tourist bus a safe reliable transportation option that it irks me to say cost me 88 less in cash and one less of my nine lives than the beguiling Beetle <s> When I had visited before it was a short trip of just about two hours and it had been limited to the city center <s> I took the opportunity to drive a flat road for a bit and ventured off to the beach <s> Now is a good time to point out that here on Hvar clothing seems to be very optional <s> Stores here that sell bathing suits have an over-abundance of tops and a serious shortage of bottoms since everyone knows tops are an unnecessary accessory <s> Often it seems bottoms are over-kill as well <s> I mention this because when I found the beach it was located alongside a campground named Kamp Nudist <s> You know I had to check this out <s> I mean if pretty much every other person is already naked what on earth could camp nudist have to offer The answer of course naked activities <s> Naked windsurfing speedboat rentals vollyball snorkeling and bicycling <s> I will refrain from further comment on this delightful little quick-dry oasis but I will make one generalization <s> This was the most cumulatively attractive and well-groomed group of people I have ever seen <s> After a few hours of de-stressing oceanside I opted to drive back to Hvar for the night giving myself plenty of daylight for the journey <s> I returned the car and told the rental shop proprietor of my concerns for the safety of others should he continue to rent this sparkly plum deathtrap <s> He took the keys smiled

would commentate for her <s> I 'd tell her why being number one or 21 or 51 was important what the different jerseys signified what category climbs were and so on <s> From the helicopter shots I would say things like third one back in white that is Hincapie he is only worn the yellow jersey once before so he is going to give it all he is got there he goes or ' Schleck is going to go again See told

Biagetti family reunion took place in a small region of Italy about two hours south of Bologna and twenty minutes from the coast <s> It was like stepping back into a simpler time where families ate together every night meals lasted three hours and no one was in any hurry to move on <s> The Biagetti family is large in numbers and mammoth in heart <s> For four days we ate we laughed and we lounged poolside at a ridiculously gorgeous villa that slept the 17 of us Americans who had come to Italy and hosted the 30 others who would stop by throughout each day <s> On the mornings that I was not weighed down too much by pasta pizza or Rose I awoke to do my practice on a patio overlooking sunflower fields and lavender bushes <s> It was a dream <s> Kristen and I have birthdays one day apart which is a big part of why I am here at all also her cousin Libby and I share our birthday so with three people turning older during the week we had plenty of cause to celebrate <s> The villa we all stayed in is owned by a man named Ercole Italian for Hercules who along with being an Italian Innkeeper is a famous florist he does the flowers for Vanity Fair is annual Oscar party among others <s> So on this birthday my 36 th Libby is 17 th and Kristin is let is call it 29 th Ercole the florist to the stars decorated a heavenly confection for us girls and then he graciously provided most of the entertainment for the night <s> As Kristin is Aunt Lisa perhaps put it best 'Ercole is such fun you find yourself wanting to make sure he like you ' Kristin and I asked to be his floral assistants at next year is Oscars <s> I am afraid we might not have conveyed this desire strongly enough but you never know where the two of us might turn up <s> The four days that I spent with the Biagettis were so filled with love that I can barely convey how overwhelmed I was to be with them all <s> Italy has always been special to me I am a chunk Italian myself and each time I arrive in this country I feel instantly happy and grounded <s> This time I realized part of why that is Italy is love it is all heart and passion and comfort <s> Ciao Bella Italiano <s> Then we were on the move again off to Spain likely the only new country for me on this leg of my travels <s> Neither Kristin nor I had ever been to Barcelona before and what better reason to visit <s> Leading up to this trip Kristin was deep in planning for her time in Africa and I was moving my base from Colorado to Ohio <s> Because we were both so tied up with other tasks we never really did any planning beyond Italy other than buying plane tickets <s> This has proven to be really fun in that we have no expectations so when we stumble on Cathedral Sagrada Familia four blocks from our barely-researched-yet-perfect-for-us hotel we smile and think of ourselves as leading charmed lives <s> Then some days we get hopelessly lost spend a small fortune we could have avoided if we had invested in a guidebook and generally make international arses of ourselves <s> While in Spain we followed in the footsteps of architect Antoni Gaudi whose macabre textural style compelled us from one building to the next and finally to the surrounding the home where he lived for twenty years <s> Each day in Spain we would get up at some very civilized late-morning hour and then pretty much just randomly head out blissfully unknowing of what we might stumble upon <s> Of course this method of travel comes with mixed levels of success <s> The stumbling approach led us to a market where to isave money ' we decided to eat at a stall which we assumed would be cheaper than a sit-down restaurant <s> That lunch ran us about 60 which was decidedly more than the previous day is sit-down lunch <s> But all-in-all the stumble approach treated us well <s> When you don 't know what to expect you have no expectations so you are often pleasantly surprised <s> One night we stumbled out way past dark <s> We had a beer here a glass of vino there until finally we tripped right into a very short man who looked like he was impersonating Prince assuming Prince ever wore red sequins and rode a flower-covered bike <s> Prince Jr led us to our final bar of the night where two very drunk Irishmen bought our drinks because exactly a year before I had visited their home town of Letterkenny thanks cousin Shannon for that one <s> High off free booze we stumbled home past street performers of every shape and size <s> Kristin calls them Buskers a new term for me but one she says is widely used <s> Men and women laden with latex paints oil-based makeup and non-breathing fabrics mime mimic and dance their way to Euros from the passersby <s> Earlier in the day on La Ramba a k a <s> Busker Row I saw a man wearing just a black Speedo walking down the street o ' because there is no beach there <s> People were staring at him gape-mouthed and upon further review I realized his Speedo was actually a tattoo <s> Some quick deduction and I screamed 'Kristin Look at that man ' upon which we began chasing after him cameras at the ready <s> The crowd in front began parting women gasped men looked dejected and once we rounded the bend we saw why <s> He was HUGE <s> I mean like good luck finding a woman who would think that was a good time HUGE And not only that but he was entirely tattooed entirely Not really sure how to segue smoothly here so I will move on to a topic not related to size but rather to eyes <s> I fell deeply in love with Spain yes because it is beautiful and because Barcelona is so cosmopolitan and historic at the same time but mainly I fell in love with Spanish men Elephant man mentioned above notwithstanding If I love Italy because of its people is hearts I love Spain because of its people is eyes <s> Tall thin mocha-complexioned men with hazel eyes are everywhere <s> I was actually uncomfortable in the pre

few weeks ago I decided to weigh in at the gym just to see if my scale at home was off <s> And BOY was it EVER It had me well over <date> <s> It was at that time that I waged a war with the ding dong scale <s> I swore I would never touch it again if it was going to be so hateful <s> But alas I could not stay away from it <s> I kept weighing in under <date> at home and over that at the gym <s> Instead of being discouraged I just took a step back and started going with the scale at home I mean please it had a better weight who wants to deal with reality It has been about 3 or 4 week since I got on the scale at the gym <s> But then it has been about 3 weeks since I have been at the gym consistently <s> I have had frigid cold temps and sick kids and no time to go the gym <s> So today when I moseyed on into the lovely gym to do my work out I thought I would tackle the dumb scale today <s> I am not scared So on my way out I put my stuff down hopped on the scale and <s> I almost passed out AGAIN Only this time I am proud to announce the scale happened to be at <date> <punctuationfreak> I skipped the <date> is If I could have done cartwheels with out seriously hurting myself because

good Christmas My dearest comrades otherwise known as the bloggerhood jeans I come to you today after about two weeks of family fun food and craziness to tell you my fatty has lost 11 pounds <s> It is unheard of I know for a fatty to loose weight during the holiday season but mine did Ok so lets back up a bit and I will tell you the adventures that I have been on in the last two weeks <s> After our trip to the 4th grade Christmas party fatty had a much needed vacation at home with her two adorable little non-fatty kids <s> They had Christmas cheer at Church where fatty wore me to dinner <s> And her little Christian buns owned that sanctuary And yes she showed it to her friends Please note tho I might say she 'owned it 'but she did not strut or flaunt because that is not like MY fatty she is way to proper for that The week leading up to Christmas consisted of shopping for the little non -fattys with her fabulous 'other half of we 'a trip to her favorite Mexican Restaurant PMS which despite a few much needed get out of my way or I will hurt you trips to Sonic Happy Hour for a large Cherry Coke was very uneventful as far as the high caloric high fructose corn syrup cravings are concerned and a trip in a blizzard to Kansas City Missouri with the whole fatty clan <s> That was fun She wore me out to a fun dinner with her clan for Christmas dinner in a blizzard in which she walked for three blocks to a restaurant that was supposed to be open but due to weather was not and then back another two blocks to the place that she ended up eating but only because it was the ONLY place crazy enough to be open <s> All was not lost though it turned out to be a fun memory making trip and the dinner was even good <s> She ate a spinach salad And then walked back to the and WORKED OUT I was so proud of my fatty Then the next week she wore me out for New Years Eve Where again she ate a spinach salad <s> She rocked the buns with her 'other half of we 'to hear her favorite local band of all time Bakerville <s> Boy what a fun couple of weeks this fatty and I have had together <s> My friends I hope that you all have had an equally good time sporting your fatty is buns during this holiday season <s> Here is to a fabulous <date> Until next time my friends <s> Size 18 jeans not <math> Fatty wears me to a Christmas Party <s> My fellow comrades Today my Fatty-bo-batty or FBB for short wore me out of the house for the first time since I arrived and it was about stinkin time Where did my FBB take me you ask Out for a Sonic Happy Hour drink Out to eat Out for ice cream Out to shop Nope she took me to a fourth grade Christmas party <s> At first I was appalled <s> Why would I fabulous jeans you know the ones that make her buns look squeezable and AWESOME want to go to a fourth grade party I mean come on Fourth graders have not had two kids <s> They could care less that I have to squeeze some full figured 5 '10 ' <date> something pound FBB into my outstanding material <s> But oh well <s> I walked her fabulous buns into that class room and followed every move she made <s> And to top it all off she did not even enjoy the buffet of high fructose corn syrup well maybe just one little cookie <s> She did not drink a soda today or eat wee little donuts <s> No sweet tea chocolate candy suckers potato chips dips or anything <s> I tell you what fellow bloggerhood jeans my FBB kicked some major high fructose corn syrup butt today I felt honored to make her buns look good Well it is time for her to take me off now she needs to put on her sweat pants and big baggy shirt because she can 't breath I will write more the next time she decides to take me out <s> And I will try to get her to take a picture of me and her buns <smiley> Until then good luck With love Bloggerhood size 16 jeans Our darling Micah got the size 16 jeans from Sue I am super excited about her journey over the next two months and I wish her a ton of luck in getting too skinny for the sixteens baby Here is her blog post about the package <smiley> Jenn <math> They are here <punctuationfreak> Said jeans appeared in my mailbox on Monday and it was so fun I felt like a little kid seeing that package <s> I hurried inside and opened my package from Sue <s> She is so sweet She put fun confetti in the package and some candy canes which if you saw the video you know I don 't have to feel bad for eating them <s> I took pictures <s> I just could not help myself <s> So now we get down to business <s> Can she fit into the size 16 jeans as hoped <math> SIDE NOTE <math> I really wanted to take some pictures in the jeans out in Dewey so you all could see our cute little town and so you could see all the fun thing that the jeans are getting to do but it was REALLY cold when they got here and I was not doing muffin top shots outside so you get to see my bedroom instead <smiley> With promises to see fun places with me in the jeans Ok so here goes and I really can not believe that I took these pictures and I really can not believe that I am SHOWING them online Ok so there you go They fit but snug <s> I could wear them but would really be comfortable after about day three when they are nice and stretched <s> But I have incredible support here at home and some really supportive friends so FATTY BO BATTY BE GONE Can 't wait to see what happens after two months <s> Good luck to all the other Bloggerhood sisters

<s> Two LA Landmarks Pacific Dining Car and Langer is Remember the 80s We didn 't walk we power walked <s> We didn 't eat breakfast or lunch <s> We had a power breakfast or a power lunch <s> And a suit wasn 't a suit <s> That is right <s> It was a power suit <s> The whole thing made me want to power vomit <s> When a friend invited me for breakfast at the venerable Pacific Dining Car in downtown LA my first thought was 'What should I wear 'I considered wearing a power suit or at least a power jacket while we ate our power breakfasts but settled on a look that was more casual Friday than uptight Tuesday <s> After all I figured the ultimate power comes from having a flexible schedule that allows you to take off the morning for a downtown breakfast outing <s> Sure enough all of the other diners were dressed in suits and ties and gazed at spreadsheets and pie charts between sips of coffee from a china cup <s> To fit in dining companion and I studied Jonathan Gold is list of 99 Things to Eat Before You Die while we developed a strategy for our next take over of a restaurant <s> I hadn 't set foot in the Pacific Dining Car since the 80s when I worked downtown as a briefcase-lugging corporate drone <s> I was happy to see that it hasn 't changed a bit <s> Some icons become stodgy over time but not the Pacific Dining Car <s> It still looks and feels fresh and elegant refined and special with its rich colors linen table cloths and fine china and silver <s> Butter rosettes and a fresh rose at every table I ordered the breakfast hash which is made from the left over steaks from the night before <s> Unlike most hashes which tend to be at least <math> potato this one was <math> steak and <math> potato all swimming in a rich savory gravy <s> It came topped with a poached egg and two biscuits on the side <s> Power breakfast indeed <s> Dining companion went for the Cajun style eggs benedict featuring sauteed mushrooms and a crab cake instead of Canadian bacon <s> After our two-hour breakfast we realized that it was time for lunch <s> So we did what any food-loving duo would do we traveled a few blocks away to Langer is to try one of their legendary pastrami sandwiches <s> When the sandwiches arrived the first thing I noticed was the warm bread <s> Then when I bit into the sandwich I immediately noticed the crisp chewy crust <s> I was enraptured <s> Apparently this is what rye bread is all about <s> Why doesn 't everyone do it this way We packed up our sandwiches to go and I vowed that I wasn 't ever going to eat again <s> That is until I returned home and that rye bread started calling my name <s> Of course I did what any good girl from the 80s does <s> I powered down the pastrami sandwich and then I took a power nap <s> Be prepared for a <date> minute wait in line and a <date> minute wait for 'fast 'food at The Slaw Dogs <s> You may assume that you can get a realistic glimpse into my eating habits by reading this blog <s> You would be wrong <s> Or half wrong <s> Or maybe half right <s> Take the last nine scrumptious days <s> I 've slurped Japanese udon and soba at Sanuki No Sato indulged in a friend is home-made cassoulet ala The Art of French Cooking sampled more than a half dozen 'red wines under 10 'at the same friend is home toasted to good health with a bottle of Veuve Clicquot shared paella charcutterie Spanish potatoes and a bottle of Spanish wine with friends at Three Drunken Goats met friends for dinner at Malbec where my medium rare steak arrived well done but the staff did an excellent job of correcting the overcook had a tasteless burger at The Counter in Pasadena sipped a Manhattan at the decades-old bar at Musso and Frank tried the jellied consomme like gelatin with a bouillon cube beef tongue mixed salad and Welsh Rarebit at Musso is and couldn 't get enough of the fusilli with fresh tomatoes hangers on from the garden shallots garlic olive oil splash of balsamic and sea salt I made for dinner on Saturday night <s> And even though this rundown sounds like a foodie is fantasy it is far from my typical week of dining and drinking <s> And it omits a lot of indulgences like the half sleeve of Girl Scout Thin Mint Cookies that I gobbled down in the car on the way back from the Scout is home <s> Or the Cherry Garcia ice cream that I had to have after a friend blogged about the joys of the cherry and chocolate confection <s> All but one of these meals was blog-worthy but I am not tempted to write about a single one of these dining adventures <s> And why not Because I want to talk about hot dogs <s> The Slaw Dogs kicks the classic hot dog up a notch <s> Specifically the dogs with attitude at Pasadena is newest specialty restaurant The Slaw Dogs on North Lake Avenue <s> The hotdoggery has been open since February and already lines are snaking out the door an unusual sight in the City of Roses especially north of the <date> <s> Today I chatted with two women who had driven all the way from Camarillo and Torrance to sample the dogs <s> While other eateries are tumbling faster than dominoes what is there about The Slaw Dogs that is packing in the crowds from all over Southern California It is an All-American classic <s> I know the saying is 'As American as Apple Pie 'but we could just as easily substitute 'hot dog 'for 'apple pie 'Can you think of a hot dog without visions of family barbecues fourth of July cookouts greasy diners and baseball games <s> It is nostalgia wrapped in a bun <s> It is a Regional Favorite Seems like every state puts a different twist on the classic <s> There is the Chicago-style hotdog <s> The Coney Island dominates the Northeast <s> And of course the restaurant is namesake the slaw dog is a West Virginia classic <s> The bloggers at West Virginia Hot Dog point out that nobody in West Virginia orders a islaw dog 'because it is a given that your hot dog will come with slaw Well it is a given if you live in one of the southern counties in the state <s> West Virginians take 'regional food 'to a whole new level The Slaw Dog gives you the chance to order your dog just the way you like it whether you 're from Brooklyn New York or Charleston West Virginia <s> It Was Ready for a Makeover Like the humble grilled cheese sandwich macaroni and cheese and hamburger the hot dog was ready to benefit from all the best ingredients including a selection of 11 links offered at The Slaw Dogs <s> It is Fun to Have Choices In a 'ition to the choice in links The Slaw Dogs offers 25 istandard toppings 'and 22 'custom toppings 'It Lends Itself to Fusion The Slaw Dogs offers a Thai Slaw Dog with chicken sausage spicy peanut-cocunut satay dressing cilantro-carrot slaw crushed peanuts and siracha aioli <s> The Green Monster which appears to be one of the most popular dogs offered is topped with roasted green chilli that runs the length of the dog chipotle mayo grilled onion pepperjack and spicy garlic salsa <s> For my first visit I went with 'The Original 'with chilli cheese mustard onions and cole slaw but I asked them to hold the cheese <s> It came served with a knife and fork but that is almost as much fun as slicing up your pizza before you eat it <s> Unfortunately my grilled hot dog bun became unhinged after two bites but that didn 't stop me from using my hands to polish off the classic <s> Left 'The Original islaw dog Right The Green Monster a crowd favorite How did it compare with the slaw dogs I 've devoured in my home state Unlike the fine shre 'ed cabbage in West Virginia the slaw is coarse shre 'ed at The Slaw Dogs <s> And the <smiley> buns are soft and steamy not dry from the grill <s> On the other hand the chilli and the grilled hot dog were superior at The Slaw Dogs <s>

<s> Yes yes soon the fourway bonding attempt with begin <s> Harriet gets her staples out on Tuesday her incision looks like it healed nicely as there was no redness or swelling and she was a good girl and didn 't lick it <s> She has seemed a bit depressed probably a result of the surgery and no being let out of her pen <s> Harriet in her willow tent and all matching floor towels <s> I tried putting the Snoozy pad in the tent but it was pushed out <s> Once arranged near the food bowls she often stretches out on it <s> Harriet has some definite ideas about <weirdcaps> <s> Her appetite has not been as sharp as her pre-surgery self or as the other rabbits who seem to think they are being starved <s> However in the last day or so appetite is seeming better and she was skittering around her pen and working hard at pulling a towel through the bars <s> There were two meetings without bars one inadvertent and one planned between Amelia and Harriet <s> The first was when in an attempt to let Harriet have more room I barricaded off half the back room <s> Amelia was engaged with a nap in her lean-to <s> Harriet was quite stimulated by the whole arrangement and within a few minutes had broken down the barricade and was nose to nose with Amelia who did absolutely nothing <s> This seemed like a good sign so later I opened the outside annex AKA the Bunnex and let Amelia out <s> She immediately found the pumpkin I 'd put out because it was molding on one side and began to help herself not to the moldy part which was really very small <s> I let Harriet out for some room exploration but she was more interested in finding Amelia <s> Play the video to see what happened <s> This event happened twice each time ending in a light scuffle <s> Now I have an idea of what to expect <s> If I can

live unless you do a custom frame and buy the glass separately and such and such <s> However after more thought than seemed necessary I realized if I bought the 16 x 12 frame I 'd only have to trim an inch from the length and I could fill in the gap at the bottom with the Angora fur that Alice so kindly sent along in the package <s> It looks pretty good it is fun to have some new art <s> I am going to hang it low so the rabbits can continue to admire it and commune with the image of their friend FATS <s> Amelia especially considers him her special friend <s> Amelia thinks about Fats and wonders what a Winter Wonderland would be like <s> Harriet got spayed last Tuesday it was a little scary when the vet said she was having trouble waking up and that sometimes happened <s> She was slow to eat and pee and poop and I had to give her a couple of doses of Medicam <s> She seems to have fully recovered judging for appetite poops and boxing matches with the other rabbits through the fencing and

spot like the bathtub or a pen outside <s> Tyler and Harriet lounge while Amelia shows concern for the difficulties of photographing a very dark rabbit <s> Since she has been here Harriet has been in a pen where everybun can see her and interact with her through the bars <s> There has been a little boxing and and the only time there was much upset was when she was in the kitchen and Tyler was in the Rabboratory everything was wrong and they each blamed the other <s> There has been lots and lots of pooping and peeing on both sides of the fence <s> When she first arrived it had seemed like Harriet would be the queen of box habits but now that she feels she needs to demarcate her space she is got both barrels blazing and the other rabbits aren 't much better <s> Harriet on a bun-errand <s> Often all rabbits are quite relaxed and I have them close while eating <s> There has been flopping on both sides a good sign Harriet gets to go out in the yard with supervision <s> Here she seems to have a set pattern of places she needs to go and things to chin so far she has not deviated from it <s> When I need to get her in I herd her into the kitchen and pick her up there she 'd rather not be picked up outside it is humiliating <s> Amelia loves to go out on the deck and thinks she ought to be allowed into the garden too <s> Have a good week Harriet can be a bit of the trickster she is

to take back to her pen <s> Because Harriet is in a pen I try to bring her out often to stretch her legs <s> The kitchen has a good straight run in it and I 've rabbit proofed the back yard enough

looked everywhere <s> I could just imagine what the BF would say because I had been saying I thought she wasn 't going to make a break for it and would stick around <s> Thinking she might have breached the side barrier and gone out front I went into the kitchen on my way through the house <s> Who comes racing out of the back room with Amelia on her tail yes it was the run away rabbit <s> Harriet had hopped up the steps and into the kitchen which she knew well and returned to her room to 'visit 'with Amelia <s> With a whole kitchen to explore the most interesting thing is still of the other side of the door <s> Tyler was complaining that he hasn 't had adequate face time on the blog and that we finally had some light so couldn 't I take some pictures of him After he saw them he

well Our coaches almost didn 't know what to say after each part of our training We also did a runthrough to make sure we were ready physically and mentally before we competed <s> After that we had a little time to do make up relax watch video of our music practice and then we were getting ready for the big event <punctuationfreak> Imagine what goes in your mind while you 're sitting there an hour before you go <s> You think about thousands corrections that you have and then you think of how many people are going to watch you on tv that your family is in the stands for the BIG competition you also think about how many hours weeks years that you work to be able to swim there It was almost 3 then you put your cap and googles back on and you get ready to do the last warm up before the competition <s> I did my laps of the routine with the I-pod that goes underwater with a teammate then got out and walk to the call room <s> There we had our focus group where the captain says what to

<s> Yesterday morning I was annoyingly awoken by the changing of the guards which made me think - maybe I spoke too soon about this normal thing When I say changing of the guards I don 't mean the fancy speal they do at Arlington National Cemetery how great would that be though What I do mean is that at around 4am-ish the lovely gentleman who so kindly have watched over the house all night and patrolled now go home to their families and taking their place are more nice gentleman Really I am not being facetious they are very kind As the new guards come in they are instructed to check their guns to ensure they are locked and loaded ahh I learn the meaning of locked and loaded - but shouldn 't it be loaded and then locked Well we are in The Ghanny so not everything is in tip top condition so if you don 't spiffy up that gun you can imagine how many times you might have to ensure it is properly loaded or locked - heck I am not even going to pretend I know what they are doing All I know is that they are making that 'chich-chich ' noise over and over and over again at 4 FREAKING AM It was like a literally wake up call - no Anna your life is not normal Better yet the neighbor guards thought this was going to be a musscle fest so they started flexing too Hello we are sleeping

<s> Format Trade Paperback <date> pages Publisher Other Press ISBN <date> <date> <math> Pub Date June 30 <date> Price <date> In recent years there has been no shortage of expat-written nonfiction books set in Beijing but fiction in the same category is hard to come by <s> That is why Jonathan Tel is new story collection The Beijing of Possibilities caught my eye the moment I saw it on the Commonwealth Writers ' Prize <date> short list thanks Leela Soma and Rob <s> It is a slim little volume with a most intriguing cover art of a pretty Chinese lady with what appears to be sightless eyes <s> When friends and I first saw the cover design we had a nice discussion of what that might signify was she looking 'inside 'herself or was she deliberately refusing to isee 'that which is obvious to everyone else Don 't you just love cover art that intrigues I did some research on the art and found out it has been taken from the Reed Darmon collection <s> Reed Darmon is the person responsible for the 'Made in China 'graphics book and you can learn more about it here <s> To come back to the stories all twelve invoke Beijing in some way or the other even if the stories themselves vary widely in time period and location <s> The most notable aspect of Tel is storytelling is how he recounts modern facts about China but interwoven with Chinese folk tales and superstitions <s> The Monkey Legend seems to be his favorite one and the first story of the collection 'Year of the Gorilla 'begins with the sentence 'It is been a while since the Monkey King set out on his Journey to the West ' with 'A Journey to the West 'being the title of this much-loved legend and folk tale <s> Another trait I noticed is his ability to blend old China with the new and no story illustrates that better than 'The Most Beautiful Woman In China ' which links together two thousand years of Chinese history while being set in Beijing today One generic character that makes his or her appearance in many of the stories is the 'Chinese migrant ' and after reading a lot of topical articles on China I have come to the realization that Beijing even more than Shanghai is a mecca for the Chinese people it is the land of opportunity the land where dreams come true or as Tel himself describes in the title it is the land full of possibilities 'Beijing is the center of the universe <s> Ask anybody who lives there 'The true Beijinger secretly believes that people living anywhere else have to be in some sense ki 'ing ' in a foreword by Helan Xiao One of my favorite migrant characters in this collection is from the title story <s> Miss Xu is a fisherman is daughter but 'foster amother to the child of a young couple in Beijing <s> The couple have hired Miss Xu to look after their as-yet-unborn child because they are too busy to care for the child themselves in ten or twelve years time they 'll be ready to take the child to live with them <s> Unfortunately the child dies before they could hand it over to Miss Xu but because she had been registered in Bejing as a 'foster mother 'Miss Xu lands herself an unexpected ticket to residency in Beijing which is to most Chinese what an American green card is to refugees Ofcourse being a 'hick 'from Hainan a sleepy little fishing village she was treated as an outcast in Beijing which makes for a very moving story <s> Tel also has this ability to infuse his stories with playful plots and language <s> Amusing but a little sad too is 'The Book of Auspicious and Inauspicious Dreams 'where a young modern couple during renovations to their <date> is home chance upon a rusty tin of souvenirs buried in a wall of their suburban Beijing house <s> Realizing it must belong to the previous owner they do everything to try to return the tin only to be met with exclamations of protests from the previous owner who insisted she had never laid eyes on the tin before and that she 'loved Chairman Mao more than her own mother and father 'which reminds the reader of a turbulent time in China is history where to be a lover of the arts or to have 'western 'things meant having a 'bourgeois 'background which in turn meant being sent to the villages for 'reeducation ' something that was a tough and humiliating experience for most intellectuals <s> I found a couple of the stories had the overall effect of looking at a subtly distorted mirror but for the most part Tel is prose and plots are smart entertaining observant and insightful <s> It is most definitely a collection to cherish <s> Oh and before I go <s> I haven 't been able to explain the girl on the cover <s> My best guess is that she is 'Little Yu 'from the heart warmingly sad story 'The Three Lives of Little Yu 'about a childless couple who adopt a little girl whom they call 'Yu 'only to have her snatched away by the god of death <s> They adopt a second girl and call her 'Yu 'too but the same fate awaits her <s> When the third girl again called 'Yu 'enters their family it is implied that she is a reincarnation of the previous little girls <s> So could the girl on the cover have been Yu between her lives on earth I guess I am getting carried away <s> I 'll bet you not even Jonathan Tel thought about his cover as much as I have <smiley> Oh and whatever you do don 't miss the last story there is a nice twist in the tale there a brilliant narrative coup Two insightful

<s> Everything runs reasonably smoothly in the patriarchal home until wife number four intrudes on this family romance <s> Bolanle a graduate amongst the semi-literate wives is hated from the start <s> Baba Segi is glee at bagging a graduate doesn 't help matters <s> Worse Bolanle is arrival threatens to do more than simply ruffle feathers <s> She is unwittingly set to expose a secret that her co-wives intend to protect at all costs <s> Lola Shoneyin is light and ironic touch exposes not only the rotten innards of Baba Segi is polygamous household in this cleverly plotted story it also shows how women no educated or semi-literate women in contemporary Nigeria can be as restricted controlled and damaged by men - be they fathers husbands uncles rapists - as they 've never been <s> Harper Collins Canada Downtown Mogadishu today is beat-up and bone-white from the sun and a coating of dust <s> It is overlaid with a deceptive grid of empty streets <s> Most buildings are ransacked shells frozen in time or have simply vanished <s> Today when we think of Somalia we think civil war Somali pirates Islamic fundamentalism so how very refreshing to chance upon 'Black Mamba Boy 'which takes us back to a thriving Somalia of yesteryear and not just Somalia but Djibouti Sudan Eritrea Egypt a veritable tour of North-East Africa in the mid <math> is <s> Let me explain 'Black Mamba Boy 'by Somali-British author Nadifa Mohamed is based on the true story of the author is father is life <s> Opening in <date> is Aden we are introduced to Jama a ten year-old Somali boy a street kid whose mother dies unexpectedly thus leaving him alone in this world 'Jama is forced home to his native Somalia the land of his nomadic ancestors <s> War is on the horizon and the fascist Italian forces who control parts of east Africa are preparing for battle <s> Yet Jama cannot rest until he discovers whether his father who has been absent from his life since he was a baby is alive somewhere <s> And so begins an epic journey which will take Jama north through Djibouti war-torn Eritrea and Sudan to Egypt <s> And from there aboard a ship transporting Jewish refugees just released from German concentration camp across the seas to Britain and freedom 'OK my challenge here as a 'reviewer 'is how to give you my impressions without gushing or using a great many superlatives so I 'll just say this if you choose to read the book you 're in for an amazing ride through the dusty noisy but bustling streets of the some of the most important cities of North East Africa in the '30 is <s> From the vast sandy deserts of Sudan to narrow busy alleys in Somalia from the tree-lined manicured boulevards of Djibouti to the emerald-green landscape with juicy mango trees of Abyssinia you will see it all Mohamed is prose zings with the vibrancy of North African life an unfamiliar landscape of strange tribes and tongues bizarre rituals superstitions and tribal kinship <s> The sensitive way in which she handles Jama is relationships with his family and kinsmen tugs at one is heartstrings <s> In a historical context I cannot vouch for Mohamed is accuracy because I know so little about that area and in that time period but it is told so well you get completely swept up by the events and happenings <s> But central to the story is suffering the suffering of the African people at the hands of their colonizers <s> Mohamed is acute and unsparing descriptive powers render vivid everything from Aden street chaos to traditional Palestinian we 'ing in Khan Younis but her clipped depiction of the death by torture of a young Somalian man at the hands of two drunk Italians made me gasp out loud and pushed me way out of my comfort zone into a place I wasn 't sure I wanted to be <s> And that is not a bad thing because when I read I want to be astonished I want to be moved I want to be shaken to the core and Mohamed succeeds in doing this <s> Having said all this though for me the most moving part of the account is when Jama finds employment as a deck hand on board the 'Runnymede Park 'at Haifa Palestine 'Runnymede Park 'was a British prison ship carrying thousands of Jewish refugees originally from Auschwitz Bergen-Belsen and Treblinka who were denied permission to disembark in Palestine their Promised Land but instead taken back to Europe to be made an example out of thereby deterring other would-be Jewish immigrants from making the trip to Palestine <s> Her descriptions of the agony physical and mental that the poor refugees suffered are so vivid I could literally hear the crash of broken dreams and feel the dejection in my own chest <s> If you enjoy Africa history travel the story weaves its way through a labyrinth of countries stories of exile and survival this one is definitely for you Hardcover <date> pages Publisher Little Brown and Company 1 edition Jun 9 <date> Language English 'Luxurious Hearses 'is this <smiley> 'Say You 're One of Them ' collection is fourth and longest story but perhaps its most important <s> I see it as important because more than any other story I have read here so far it is this one that brings to life the political economic and religious strife we read so much about in Africa <s> The story set in Nigeria illuminates the political situation of Nigeria the poverty of the people in the Nigerian Delta the tension between the Muslims in the North and the Christians in the south and what happens when innocent people get caught in between <s> After you read this longish nouvella you come away seeing with new eyes why every now and again Nigeria plunges into Muslim-Christian riots and why despite all the oil that Nigeria possesses its people are so poor <s> Our protagonist in this story is a <math> year old boy called Jubril who is forced to head south towards the Christian part of Nigeria after riots broke out in his very-Muslim city of Khamfa which is in the north <s> Ordinarily Jubril may not have had to run away but when his own Muslim friends turned against him for having a Christian father whom he had never seen or known he decided that if he was interested in saving his life it would be prudent for him to leave his town and Muslim mother and her family and head south to be reunited with his Christian dad <s> The story of his journey from the North to South in the midst of some of the worst religious riots Nigeria has ever seen with a host of wonderfully- colourful characters that are his bus companions his fears and insecurities about heading to a part of the country that is so alien to him and his perpetual fear of being found out as a Muslim in bus full of Christian refugees is riveting suspenseful and unputdownable The reader is as tense as Jubril who is forced to try and blend in with the other people on the bus a task made much more difficult because his right hand was lopped off when he was arrested for stealing a goat months before <s> As always Akpan is writing holds you spellbound <s> Most of the story takes place on the bus with occasional flashbacks to Jubrail is life in Khamfa before he had to flee <s> As a reader you are privy to all the conversations that place on the bus the fears egos anger and other emotions that the passengers bring with them power dynamics between the well off and the not so well off the sick and the healthy <s> Many a time like Oprah I got so claustrophobic from being on that bus I had this strong urge to jump off and yet the writing and the thought of what might happen next kept me glued to the pages 'An Ex-Mas Feast 'was audacious 'The Fattening of Gabon 'was downright sad but 'Luxurious Hearses 'is gruesome <s> You 're going to need a strong stomach to endure the second half of the novel <s> Gruesome it might be but at no point do you get the feeling the author is aiming for sensationalism instead you come away feeling deeply for the characters the victims and the persecutors alike for you come to understand that each man is simply doing all he can to survive <s> Since each of the five stories in this book are set in different countries in Africa you might want to use Howard French is 'A Continent for the Taking 'or even Richard Dowden is 'Africa Altered States Ordinary Miracles 'as a companion read <s> I found both very helpful in explaining Africa to me 'Fattening for Gabon 'is Uwem Akpan is second story nouvella length at <date> pages in the collection 'Say You 're One of Them ' <s> It starts off innocently enough with a young <math> year old boy narrating how his maternal uncle offers to take him and his 5-year old sister to live with him on the border of Benin and Gabon because the boy is parents are dying of AIDS and too poor and sick to look after the children but the story very gradually starts to take on a sinister tone which gets completely brutal towards the end 'Selling your child or nephew could be more difficult than selling other kids ' that is the blunt line with which 'Fattening for Gabon ' begins <s> I wish so much Akpan hadn 't used that opening line because it really does give it all away <s> The story is so beautifully written that had Akpan waited to reveal this say about halfway through the story I think the reader would have been shaken to the core and which reader doesn 't mind being shaken Anyway what is done is done and this other child-narrated story succeeds in provoking the whole gamut of emotions from incredulity to disgust and from confusion to absolute fear in the reader <s> For me the biggest issue here was child manipulation I could have screamed at all of the adults in this story and cheerfully lined up against a wall to be shot <s> I know I know some of you might think I am over reacting but you know when Uwem Akpan was interviewed he stated that all these stories were drawn from real people he met and counselled in his years as a Jesuit Priest <s> Just to know that there are adults like this makes my blood boil <s> Again as in the previous story one of Akpan is strengths is in how he slips into the skins of his characters no matter what gender or age they might be <s> He also has such a gift for description and narration <s> There are several scenes that stand out for me in this story the main one being the Thanksgiving service at church that Fofo Kpee the uncle organizes in order to give thanks for his ill-begotten gain <s> Akpan describes the procession the dancing the characters their clothes the gifts the priest is invocations the offertory to god and the elation the family feels to be given so much importance on that day so vividly it is literally like watching the service unfold on a cinematic screen <s> What a writer this man is Something I liked very much and that is probably because I listened to this on audio as well as read it in print is Akpan is frequent use of the local dialect in the dialogue <s> Four colloquial languages were used in this particular story <s> English French Idaatcha and Egun sometimes in the same paragraph <s> I have spoken to people who found that distracting not me <punctuationfreak> I guess knowing a little French does help speed the read along <s>

want to watch the Oprah Book Club interview and book discussion with the author here Hardcover <date> pages Publisher Little Brown and Company 1 edition Jun 9 <date> Language English 'Say You Are One of Them 'by Uwem Akpan a former Jesuit Priest is a short story collection picked by Oprah for her book club that pays tribute to the wisdom and resilience of children even in the face of the most agonizing circumstances <s> All the stories in this collection can be read as stand-alone stories and because they are all so stunning revealing and heartbreaking I feel like they deserve to be written about individually rather than together so I here I go with a few thoughts on the first story and a link to where you can read the story for yourself 'An Ex-Mas Feast ' about a very young child prostitute and set in a slum in Nairobi can be a tough story to read and if you 're feeling particularly fragile it is perhaps not a story you will want to read <s> It is about tough situations and people just trying to do their best with the rotten cards they 've been dealt <s> Although the lives of these protagonists and their stories will leave you shaking your head Akpan makes no judgement on his characters and neither must you <s> Although this is a short story Akpan manages to bring up several important issues like the importance of education in finding a way out of poverty hunger survival family bonds and the importance of family especially at festival time <s> To read the full story in the New Yorker please go here For an indepth review of this particular story please go here Paperback <date> pages Publisher You Write On 8 Dec <date> Language English Oft late there has been a surge of books that claim to strike at the heart of the Indian immigrant experience and many of them do like Jhumpa Lahiri is 'Unaccustomed Earth ' Manju Kapur is 'The Immigrant ' Bharati Mukherjee is 'Desirable Daughters 'etc <s> But most of these novels are set either in the <smiley> or in England so when I heard about Indo-Scot writer Leela Soma is novel set both in Glasgow and Chennai Madras I knew it was going to be unusual and different because I don 't think I 've ever read the experiences of an Indian immigrant in Glasgow before The central characters Ram and Sita are brought together by their families in what is commonly known as an 'arranged marriage 'in India <s> Although Sita is a well educated independent young woman who longs to fall in love she allows herself to be talked into marriage with Ram a young medic based in Glasgow because she knows that is what is expected of her <s> I thought Soma captured very well the painful familial expectations that all of us growing up in India have experienced <s> Unfortunately for the couple they have nothing in common <s> Ram is a fastidious and earnest young man who has a hard time showing his emotions <s> Sita is a vivacious intelligent chatty and emotional young lady who simply cannot understand why Ram cannot be more demonstrative caring or expressive <s> Unlike some of the other books with immigration as a theme Sita doesn 't have major problems adjusting to her new life in Glasgow <s> After all she is a convent-educated young girl steeped in an English education that was primed and prepared for Cambridge ' an Indian in every outward way but with the thoughts and aspirations of a liberally-educated mi 'le class westerner 'What she cannot come to terms with is having a marriage devoid of romance <s> Sita and Ram soon get caught up in their separate lives but continue to be bound together by duty familial and societal expectations their daughter Uma and other cultural trappings <s> Soma carefully unravels the story of this stifling but moving marriage <s> She does so without melodrama and with careful attention to the couple is mundane moments of tenderness <s> Both characters are extremely likable but both have their flaws and I found it impossible to take sides <s> The two are ably supported by a chorus of other great characters like BB the resident old gossip Lata Sita is best friend and confidante Eileen a wee Scottish lass who marries a Muslim doctor only to regret it and Neil Sita is paramour <s> Beyond the marriage and family this novel deals with the momentous themes of love and belonging it is also an examination of immigration identity walking the tightrope between two distinct cultures and so on <s> Most immigrants inhabit an in-between space that is a little difficult to describe but Leela being an immigrant herself has ably captured and given life to that space when she says and I paraphrase An immigrant is affection for his or her adopted country and its people ranges from highs to lows <s> On days when homesickness prevails nothing seems right with the city on the other hand the sheer freedom of being able to live life away from the watchful eyes of society and family back home can be exhilarating I thought Soma very ably introduces her readers to Glasgow a city many of us are not so familiar with and I thought her idea of introducing colloquial Scottish phrases through the book helped steep the narrative in local flavour <s> The history and anthropological buffs amongst us will be quite impressed at how the Scots and the people of Madras influenced each other <s> Much of the story is set against the political landscape of Sccotland from the <date> is to the present day and that makes for interesting reading too <s> This is a story of immigration in the late '70 is <math> to be precise and having emigrated from India to Canada in <date> I found it very interesting to compare Sita is immigration experience with mine <s> I think it is so much easier today for one thing staying in touch with the home country is a cinch because of the internet also one never has to crave for home food or cooking supplies as almost every neighborhood has its own ethnic stores not to mention cable television companies that beam programmes from India right into your living room <s> Sita had to wait weeks to make a 'trunk-call 'when she wanted to speak to her parents however I think it made for a more determined assimilation into one is adopted culture <s> Today many immigrants continue to live exactly as they did at home <s> They don 't feel the need to assimilate and many are not encouraged to

gave up his life for humankind and indeed being prepared to give up one is life has become the greatest expression of love between lovers a parent and child and sometimes even best friends <s> Having said that however I 'd like to ask you this what is the biggest sacrifice you would make not for a friend a lover or even a family member but for a stranger someone you don 't know someone you will gain nothing from Now that is a tough one isn 't it Some people are driven to altruistic lengths to help a stranger in need <s> Many will donate money and time or both <s> Some will make radical donations of a healthy kidney or liver to to people in need <s> Bu 'hists are well known for a ritual where they take on other people is sufferings but all these actions wonderful as they are are usually premeditated and the giver has had time for prepare himself or herself for this sacrificial gift <s> Would we be as giving if we 're taken by surprise and with an urgency that leaves no room for thinking or planning 'Little Bee 'is the story of two such strangers and how their fates intertwine one fateful summer is day in Nigeria <s> The central theme of the story examines how despite deep-seated convictions life unfairly places a disproportionate emphasis on the decisions we make in split seconds <s> Other prominent themes in the book include asylum seekers the state of detention centers in the UK and issues a challenge to its readers to ponder why the word 'refugee 'has become such an ugly word in today is parlance <s> For instance why is it that in late 60 is and even early '70 is defectors from the then USSR or other European communists state were cheered on and even celebrated as heroes but today we balk at having to share our resources with their countrymen <s> Why do we treat refugees as criminals locking them away until their cases can be heard Why do their cases take so long to hear The novel is a bittersweet one and told in two voices the two main female protagonists that we spoke of earlier in the review <s> This works well because the two women are from opposite sides of the great class divide and by hearing both their voices the reader gets a dual perspective instead of just one <s> About the characters I am not sure I could be friends with any of them in real life but they made for great character studies So to summarize this is a novel that is sad and yet funny serious and yet light-hearted heavy and yet it is only a wisp of a novel overall a lovely reading experience This novel is called 'The Other Hand 'in the UK and in India and the rest of the sub-continent <s> Anyone know why novels are sometimes given different titles in different parts of the world

Reisch screenplay Starring Greta Garbo Melvyn Douglas Ina Claire Bela Lugosi Sig Ruman Felix Bressart Alexander Granach I find it a little o ' that on the cusp of WWII Hollywood delivered a piece of anti-Communist propaganda when clearly there were at that time more immediate threats to European freedom <s> Ninotchka <math> was produced while Ernst Lubitsch waited for Margaret Sullavan and James Stewart to become available for The Shop Around the Corner <math> but it was by no means merely a fill-in project the film was Greta Garbo is first and only collaboration with Lubitsch and the actress ' penultimate role before a premature retirement Editor is note See Previous Post in order to read writer Andrew Katsis review of The Shop Around the Corner MGM is publicity campaign used the tagline 'Garbo Laughs 'to advertise that this was a new type of role for the enigmatic actress a comedy that promised to humanise her otherwise somber screen persona this campaign deliberately referenced the tagline for Garbo is Anna Christie <math> which had proclaimed 'Garbo Talks ' <s> Though the screenplay by Billy Wilder Charles Brackett and Walter Reisch unsurprisingly has many genuine sparks of wit the balance of romance farce and political commentary never quite sits as comfortably as one would expect given the talents involved <s> When three Soviet diplomats Sig Ruman Felix Bressart and Alexander Granach arrive in Paris to sell off some jewelry confiscated from the Grand Duchess Ina Claire during the Bolshevik Revolution they find it difficult to keep their minds on their work <s> Far away from the cold drab apartments of Moscow the French capital is bustling with life warmth and prosperity just forget that the French upper-class are not in fact a reasonable yardstick for comparison with the Soviet proletariat <s> Playful aristocrat Lon Melvyn Douglas the Duchess ' romantic lover succeeds in corrupting the bumbling diplomats by flaunting the luxuries of capitalistic society <s> To ensure that the transaction goes through smoothly the Soviets send down Ninotchka Garbo a curt tight-lipped Bolshevik with a militant hatred of Capitalism and everything it stands for <s> Against all o is the debonair playboy Lon and the belligerent Ninotchka fall for one another an attraction that ultimately proves more significant than one is national allegiance <s> Unfortunately once love softens the formerly stone-faced Ninotchka the film shifts from being a lighthearted political farce not unlike To Be or Not to Be <math> or Wilder is One Two Three <math> to a weepy romance <s> Lubitsch followed Ninotchka with The Shop Around the Corner <s> What worked so well in the latter film I thought was that Lubitsch is heart was not necessarily with the star-crossed lovers James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan but with Frank Morgan is shop owner and his familial relationship with its employees <s> The three reluctant Soviet diplomats in Ninotchka are utterly charming supporting characters but too often they are shunned in favour of the central romance which seems to tread water once as advertised Garbo breaks character and enjoys a hearty chuckle <s> Nevertheless Melvyn Douglas is magnificently debonair bringing something distinctly likable to the role of a lazy playboy aristocrat <s> During her opening act you can almost see a smile forming beneath Garbo is icy

Afternoon readers I 'am so very 'happy 'to welcome authors Eric Beetner to sit down with me this Afternoon before he embark on his trip to China along with his wife to adopt their second child and I 'am equally happy to welcome author J <s> B <s> Kohl who is joining us via over the telephone intercom due to the fact that she lives on the east coast Well let me begin our interview by saying <s> Good-Afternoon Eric and Good-Afternoon J <s> B <s> Kohl I know that you have been very busy promoting your book 'One Too Many Blows to the Head ' That is why I am so happy that you both have decided to join me this afternoon <s> First let me start by asking you this question <weirdcaps> Where Are You Both Originally From Author Eric Beetner I was born in Iowa but then quickly moved to California back to Iowa to one town Connecticut and then to another where I spent my 'formative ' years <s> I 've also lived in Boston NYC briefly and Los Angeles for the past 17 years <s> Author J <s> B <s> Kohl I live in Virginia right now but am originally from Nebraska <s> <weirdcaps> When And Why Did You Both Begin Writing Author Eric Beetner I started writing screenplays as a way to make a movie without the expense of making a movie <s> I went to film school so it has always been part of the plan to make movies and I was getting impatient <s> I like that when you write you are in control of the entire process <s> That control ends abruptly when you try to sell it but for that brief moment it is fantastic <s> I took to fiction writing after I burned out on scripts <s> I wrote my first novel in secret since everyone you meet is 'working ' on a novel but <math> never actually write one <s> I hate being that guy <s> I didn 't say it out loud to anyone until after I finished <s> Even now not all my friends really know I write 'One Too Many Blows To The Head 'was a surprise to a lot of people <s> <weirdcaps> Wow Unbelievable But Believable J <s> B <s> Kohl I have always written I guess but I didn 't begin writing professionally until about three years ago <s> At that time we moved to the east coast and I decided that rather than find a new job I 'd just give writing a try <s> <weirdcaps> <repeatedchars> <s> Very Interesting <s> <weirdcaps> When Did Both Of You First Consider Yourself Writers Eric Beetner In many ways I still don 't but I guess when I first got paid for screenwriting <s> For one script I got paid a paltry sum but when it was listed in Variety it said I got a six figure deal I checked the contract wondering where my money was and the film would have had to make over <date> million dollars for me to make that much <s> Instead the film never even got made <s> <weirdcaps> Laughter <s> Wow I 'am so sorry to hear that the film was never made but hang in there Eric <s> <weirdcaps> J <s> B <s> J <s> B <s> Kohl Ooh <s> Tough question <s> I guess I still have to remind myself that I am a writer <s> I 've never really thought about it <s> My husband tells everyone his wife is a writer <s> I guess I say it but I don 't know when I started thinking of myself that way <s> I guess if I had to nail down a particular time I started thinking of myself as a writer I 'd have to say it was after my first book was published <s> <weirdcaps> What Inspired You Both To Write Your First Book Eric Beetner Reading <s> Just loving the stuff I was reading and wanting to jump on that bandwagon <s> I make no pretense of reinventing the wheel or anything <s> I am a genre writer and I am fine with that <s> J <s> B <s> Kohl I had a character in my head that I had been carrying around for a few years <s> I wanted to write something based on that character just to prove to myself that I could complete an entire novel <s> <weirdcaps> It Seems As If You Both Our On Your Way To Becoming Very Successful Writers <s> By The Way What Books Are You Both Reading Now Eric Beetner Just finished The Fifth Grave written in <date> and banned for over 40 years <s> Not bad <s> My to be read pile is over 40 books deep <s> I just cracked open Missy by Chris Hannan <s> I am taking a very long plane trip soon and I plan to bring 5 or 6 Hard Case crime books to knock out on the flights <s> J <s> B <s> Kohl I am reading two books right now Why Shoot a Butler by Georgette Heyer and Midnight Fugue by Reginald Hill <s> <weirdcaps> The Books That You Both Are Reading Sounds Very Interesting <s> <weirdcaps> Who Are Your Favorite Authors And What Is It That Really Strikes You About Their Work Eric Beetner I am a huge Cornell Woolrich fan <s> The very definition of noir <s> I don 't have strong allegiance to many particular authors <s> I generally don 't read series so I don 't get caught up in reading 15 or 20 books about the same character <s> I LOVE Joe R <s> Lansdale <s> He may be my favorite of contemporary authors <s> Sunset amp Sawdust is amazing and packs so many damn ideas and interwoven plots into one volume that is thrilling to behold <s> I love anyone with a distinct voice like that <s> All his books are set in East Texas where he is from and he knows the fabric of that country <s> It shows in everything he writes <s> I 've been reading all of Marcus Sakey is stuff I like Jason Starr Steve Brewer who I think more people should be aware of <s> Scott Smith only has two books but I love them both <s> I really love finding an old out of print book from the 40s or 50s and digging up a gem <s> That is the best <weirdcaps> I Have To Agree With You Wholeheartedly When It Comes To Author Cornell Woolrich Being The Author That Defines All That Represent Or Defines What Film Noir Should Be <s> <weirdcaps> J <s> B kohl How About You <s> J <s> B <s> Kohl Denis Lehane is one of my favorites <s> I like the understatement he uses in writing <s> I find it more powerful than overzealous descriptions of events <s> He is really good <s> I like Agatha Christie <s> I love how she can keep a reader guessing until the end <s> I think Stephen King does some of the best character work around <s> I felt a little sad when I finished It The Stand The Talisman because I had to say good-bye to the characters <s> I think that is a mark of a good writer when a reader is sad to get to the end of a book <s> <weirdcaps> Ahh <s> The Great Authors Denis Lehane Agatha Christie and Stephen King <s> Ha Ha <s> I Knew It J <s> B <s> I Just Needed A Writer To Confirm My Suspicion <s> Because I Too Am Reading Several Books And I Don 't Want To Part Company With The Characters In These Books Neither <s> <weirdcaps> What Books Have Most Influenced Your Life Eric Beetner My life Probably I 'd have to go back to The Phantom Toolbooth <s> It is a young adult book but it is so in love with words and language it really makes you appreciate words in a way few books for that age group do <s> <weirdcaps> <repeatedchars> <s> Very Interesting J <s> B kohl With regard to writing there are two books I pull out over and over again If You Want To Write by Brenda Ueland and Bird by Bird by Anne Lamott <s> I read both of these books long before I began writing professionally and I still pull them out when I need to feel inspired or reassured <s> Being a writer is a lonely road at times and it is easy to become discouraged <s> I find if I need a little push in the right direction these books help with that <s> As far as books I 've read that have influenced me with regard to the genre I work in I 'd have to say it was my early introduction to noir The Maltese Falcon by Dashiell Hammett The Big Sleep by Raymond Chandler the Perry Mason novels by Erle Stanley Gardner were among the top of the list <s> Early on I tried to get as many <date> is books as I could <s> I 've got one called The Door by Mary Robers Rinehart <math> and I suppose I 've read that three or four times in the last couple of years <s> I also have Motto for Murder by Merlda Mace <math> and The Affair of the Fainting Butler by Clifford Knight <math> <s> I 've read these over and over again <s> I don 't know how much they influence me per se but I find they keep me in the right frame of mind when I am working on a new project <s> <weirdcaps> Wow Amazing Who Designed The Cover <smiley> Of Your Book 'One Too Many Blows To The Head Author J <s> B <s> Kohl A very talented man by the name of Marc Sasso did the cover for us <s> Eric tweaked it with the fonts and bylines <s> <weirdcaps> Eric Do You Want To Expand A Little More On My Question Eric Beetner Oh Yes The amazing cover for our book was painted by a good friend of mine named Marc Sasso <s> He is a professional illustrator and he did us a huge favor on this one <s> It is not even really in his typical style but I gave him exactly what I wanted to keep it easy for him <s> I didn 't want him doing us a favor and then having to do a bunch of revisions <s> I sent him a reference photo and other ideas he knocked it out in one attempt and then Jennifer and I collaborated on the layout title fonts and back cover layout <s> We did all that stuff ourselves <s> People have really responded to it <s> We 've gotten a lot of compliments <s> <weirdcaps> I Must Admit That The Cover Of Your Book Is Amazing <s> Very Talented Artist This <s> Marc Sasso <s> <weirdcaps> What Was The Hardest Part Of Writing Your Book Eric Beetner The hardest part was not being able to meet in person <s> Jennifer and I have never met face to face <s> It was a challenge in some cases but then I must say in others it was a good thing I think <s> We were really allowed to write distinct and different voices for these two characters <s> JB Kohl The editing was by far the hardest part for me because it was so meticulous and so time consuming <s> Writing with Eric was fun and actually very easy <s> I was engrossed in the process a hundred percent from start to finish <s> <weirdcaps> How Did You Come <smiley> With The Title J <s> B <s> Kohl We tossed around title names for awhile <s> Our first working title was Fist but Eric came up with 'One Too Many Blows To The Head 'At first I wasn 't sure about it but over the course of a few days it grew on me <s> Eric Always much harder than you think <s> We had a few tentative titles <s> For most of it we used Fist ' <s> Then I remembered a song I love called 'One Too Many Blows To The Head 'It has nothing in common with the book but it sounds great and it just clicked <s> <weirdcaps> Do You Recall How Your Interest In Writing Originated J <s> B <s> Kohl I guess I 'd call it more of a compulsion than an interest <s> I wrote my first unassigned story in the fourth grade <s> It was called 'John the First-Time Quarterback ' I used the word 'whiskly ' in that story which is not actually a word <s> But my dad was so proud he still uses that word today <s> I guess I knew even at that young age if I could create adverbs I could write novels <s> Eric I recently found a pile of old schoolwork from the 5th 6th and 7th grade <s> In it was a story I wrote <s> It was a crime story with guns loan sharking and a car chase <s> I guess I 've always been into it even before I knew what I was writing about <s> <weirdcaps> Do You Have To Travel Much Concerning Your Books Eric I wish I have a standing invite to do a signing in Chicago but I can 't afford the time money to fly out there <s> Doing a book tour is a luxury we don 't really have the resources for <s> Being on a small publisher doesn 't allow for a travel budget <s> J <s> B <s> Kohl No not at all <s> Not that I wouldn 't enjoy traveling but it hasn 't proved to be necessary <s> There are numerous bookstores regionally where I am happy to do signings but travel time for those events is negligible <s> <weirdcaps> Did You Both Learn Anything From Writing Your Book And What Was It J <s> B <s> Kohl I learned the fine art of collaboration I think both Eric and I are a lot better at understanding the publishing process now <s> And I think we are both better editors and writers as a result of working together <s> Going into something like this you never know quite what to expect <s> It could have turned out to be one of those situations where we write a chapter a year and in ten years we 're still talking about how we really need to finish that book <s> That wasn 't the case at all <s> I work very well as a collaborator <s> Would I work as well with someone other than Eric I have no idea <s> And I really don 't know that I would want to try <s> Eric is too much fun to work with Eric I learned a ton about the craft of writing on this one <s> Much more than I did writing a book in solitude <s> I can say I am a much better writer after this process <s> <weirdcaps> Do you have any advice for other writers J <s> B <s> Kohl Keep at it <s> Write as often as you can <s> Encourage yourself <s> Have fun with it <s> We writers can tend to take ourselves too seriously <s> <weirdcaps> What About You Eric <s> Knock it off <s> Just quit <s> More room for our book on the shelves <s> <weirdcaps> Laughter <weirdcaps> Do You Have Anything Specific That You Want To Say To Your Readers Eric For anyone to find a book as small as ours and actually buy it is astounding to me <s> I firmly believe that if you like crime books or mysteries you will genuinely like this book <s> But for someone to make the effort to read about it watch the trailer read an interview like this and then make the next step and purchase it I can only say thank you <s> I know I find it much more gratifying to discover a new writer <s> I don 't read anything on any best seller lists <s> I am probably missing out but I just love the discovery so much it makes reading more satisfying for me <s> If our book ends up as one someone tells someone else about that would be the best outcome of all <s> I can make all my friends buy it but that is not nearly as gratifying as strangers who feel no obligation <s> <weirdcaps> I Truly Understand What You Are Saying Eric <s> J <s> B <s> Kohl J <s> B <s> Kohl I hope you enjoy the book as much as I enjoyed writing it <s> I appreciate the noir novels of old and I wish there were more around <s> <weirdcaps> Do You Have A Specific Writing Style J <s> B <s> Kohl I have a bad habit of starting sentences with the word 'and ' <s> I am working on that <s> I also write in incomplete sentences a lot of the time <s> I 've learned that this upsets editors to some degree which naturally makes me want to continue doing it but I am trying to break the habit <s> Eric Every time I try to write something other than crime I find myself second guessing the over-earnestness or downright cheesiness of it so I give up <s> In screenwriting I didn 't have this problem <s> I wrote a little of everything <s> But I like building a reputation as a crime writer <s> The community is just amazing and to be invited in as an equal has been really gratifying <s> <weirdcaps> Do You See Writing As A Career On The Other Hand Is Writing Your Career Eric I have a day job <s> I can 't see writing becoming a full time job any time soon <s> That is fine with me <s> My daily job is creative <s> I am a film <smiley> editor and producer sometimes writer and I do small film making projects on the side so I am very creatively fulfilled at work <s> I happen to get paid for it <s> I am very lucky <s> I just hope to make a little noise in the writing world <s> If it becomes more great <s> I am not going to mortgage the house to chase the dream though <s> <weirdcaps> Wow I Was Not Aware Of Your Day Job Eric <s> It Sounds Very Interesting Too <s> J <s> B <s> Kohl <s> J <s> B <s> Kohl I don 't see it as a career <s> I had a career <s> I didn 't enjoy it <s> I look as writing as something that I am lucky enough to do full time <s> I wish it made me more money <punctuationfreak> But I love doing it and I enjoy it 'Career ' sounds too much like 'job ' And I don 't view writing as a job <s> <weirdcaps> If You Had To Do It All Over Again Would You Change Anything In Your Lastest Book Eric Not one bit <s> J <s> B <s> Kohl I am happy with the book <s> I suppose Fokoli would have liked to punch a few more people but seriously who wouldn 't Sometimes you just gotta let things be the way they are <s> <weirdcaps> Ha Ha <weirdcaps> If You Had To Choose Which Writer Would You Consider A Mentor Eric I am too solitary and anti-social <s> I don 't do writer is groups <s> I hate classes <s> I abhor feedback from anyone really <s> So in a sense Jennifer is the closest I 've had to a mentor <s> As I said my writing improved a great deal with this book and I thank her <s> J <s> B <s> Kohl My dad is a great writer <s> He doesn 't write professionally but he is a great writer <s> When I was growing up my two sisters my dad and I would sit around the table with a stack of blank printer paper <s> One of us would come up with a sentence and we 'd all write it down <s> A timer would be set for ten minutes and we 'd all continue our own stories from that one sentence <s> At the end of ten minutes we 'd read to each other <s> Most of the stuff we wrote was really funny <s> I learned the art of writing during those sessions sentence flow reading aloud writing to entertain others <s> And my dad was the driving force behind all of that <s> My mother too is a great writer <s> She has a very subtle sense of humor that comes out on paper at times <s> She called me last week with a new book title about flatulence <s> I laughed really hard <s> My mother is such a classy person and so sophisticated <s> So my parents are my mentors <s> I can say other 'professional ' writers have influence me but it is my parents who made me what I am who gave me the genetic material that hard-wired me for this kind of life and who have always encouraged me <s> <weirdcaps> Laughter Ha Ha <s> J <s> B <s> Kohl That Is Funny What Your Mother Said About A New Book Title <weirdcaps> Is There Anything You Find Particularly Challenging In Your Writing J <s> B kohl The avoidance of procrastination <s> I find when I write on my own it is very easy to become distracted by everything going on around me <s> Eric I find writing incredibly fun and when it is fun it is easy <s> If it is not fun I stop <s> There are always more stories <s> If a story isn 't working or is a struggle I ditch it and start something new <s> I always want writing to be fun <s> <weirdcaps> Are There Any New Authors That Have Grasped Your Interest J <s> B <s> Kohl Oh wow there are so many great authors out there <s> I try to read as many authors by independent publishers as I can <s> Alan Draven David Boyle Thom Futrell Nick Quantrill <s> In fact Nick Quantrill has a new novel coming out in January <s> He writes a great crime novel <s> Eric I have befriended a bunch of short fiction writers in the online community and there are some amazing authors out there poised for greatness <s> Keith Rawson Paul D <s> Brazill Jimmy Callaway Jake Hinkson Cameron Ashley Jason Duke

A Little Of Your Current Work With <smiley> J <s> B <s> Kohl Sure we plan to work together on a new novel <s> But we both continue with our solo projects <s> I 've got a rough draft of The Deputy is Widow done but I hate it so I don 't know if it will ever see the light of day again <s> I am also working on a sort of a horror novel which isn 't my usual genre so I am having a lot of fun with that

<s> Grass ah grass 'This is but one of the many musings my husband has uttered in his sleep over the years <s> He has also fought great armies urging me alongside and sold God knows how many home improvement supplies He works for a home improvement company It has been very amusing to listen to him and even try to get him to converse successfully sometimes Sometimes he simply mumbles and I can 't understand a thing Well I don 't really know the inception of sleep-talking but as an educated guess I would say there must be something genetic about it because in the last couple of months little girl has been sleep-talking too Her vocabulary is limited in comparison and she only speaks <math> word sentences awake though she does say over 60 words so her sleep-talking has been limited to one word per instance <s> The first time she called out one of our dogs 'Lola 'I checked on her and was surprised that she was sound asleep <s> The second was 'Dad 'and then just last night 'Close 'First of all it tickles me that she calls these words out like she is shouting them to someone <s> Then the choice of words is interesting <s> I wonder what she is dreaming about in that little head of hers 
<s> Here is the idea The first person asks a question beginning with 'Would you rather 'The next poster answers the question and then asks a new question with response I 'll start the ball rolling I have some awesome ones but ill start simple oh btw all questions are fine just dont get sexual <weirdcaps> If you do I am not responsible nor will I respond <smiley> <smiley> Thanks Make them thought provoking Marissa Would you rather go without food for a week or without shelter for a week

<s> But this is no philosophy essay <s> After second year is 20th Century French Thought I vowed never to delve into the subject in great depth ever again <s> However I can say from experience that languages encapsulate humanity <s> The death of a language marks the death of an entire way of thinking of self-justification self-understanding and identity <s> Hector Kollias of King is French Department could do a much better job of explaining it than I ever could <s> You want more email him I have to spend my day speaking and understanding German and it is then that the true strength of a language to shape its speakers really comes into play <s> In English you can beat about the bush 'Erm excuse me sorry I was wondering you wouldn 't mind awfully if I happened to take this seat would you ' <s> It is a language of apology indirectness and implications <s> German No such luck <s> These structures simply don 't work <s> If you want the chair you bloody well ask if you can take the chair <s> No bones about it <s> You say what you mean and nothing else <s> Yes of course they have their idiomatic phrases - have you had a nose full of someone recently If you have an exam do you press your thumbs for luck 
<s> I still miss my father <s> I do not remember when it was he officially left me <s> There is a picture in a photo album of my oldest brother our father and myself <s> We were at a park or zoo I was at most 4 <s> I had two braids in my hair with pink ribbons that matched the pink te 'y bear I was holding <s> I was gazing past the camera with a sad angry angsty look on my face <s> My brother was eating popcorn and gazing left and not looking too happy <s> Our father was gazing right he did not look happy either <s> Was it just a bad day the three of us were having Probably the four of us because I assume it was our mother taking the picture <s> It was a picture of our family but not of a family <s> Even then we were all painfully unhappy
