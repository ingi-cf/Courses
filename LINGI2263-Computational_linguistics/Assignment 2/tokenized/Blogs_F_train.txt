<s> Chile Earthquake and Spiritual Promptings On the LDS Church News website last week there was an article about the earthquake in Chile and how the mission there had already been preparing for an earthquake in the weeks leading up to the quake </s> <s> The article is an e-mail written by Sister Lisa Laycock wife of Chile Santiago East Mission President Larry Laycock and originally sent to her friends and family after the quake </s> <s> Here is an excerpt :\ When we were set apart for this calling Elder Richard G Scott of the Council of the Twelve Apostles taught us many important lessons </s> <s> He spoke from personal experience when he was a mission president in Argentina </s> <s> One message that he shared with us is this At times during your mission you will be awakened in the mi

Ghost who will communicate with you in the stillness of the night or the peace of the early morning hours </s> <s> He will speak to you then because that is when you are still enough to hear Elder Scott further instructed us to keep a notebook beside our bed so that we could record these precious promptings </s> <s> He said that by the next morning we would be likely to forget the promptings if we didn t write them down We have been astonished at the fulfillment of Elder Scott 's prophetic words </s> <s> We have received many promptings in the exact manner that Elder Scott described </s> <s> We are so thankful that Elder Scott taught us how to recognize and act upon these precious promptings </s> <s> Had he not taught us we may not have given these promptings the attention they require Nearly two and one half weeks before the earthquake I was awakened at around 4 a m </s> by just such a prompting </s> <s> I did not hear a voice but the thought was as clear as if it had been in the form of spoken words There is going to be an earthquake </s> <s> Prepare your missionaries I sat up in bed and immediately remembered Elder Scott 's counsel </s> <s> That morning I told Larry what had happened </s> <s> He immediately set to work organizing our missionaries to prepare for an earthquake In talking with our office missionaries to arrange for them to put together a list of everything we would need to prepare in both Spanish and English we discovered that the Lord had also let two of our office missionaries know of the possibility of an earthquake in the form of dreams and the need to prepare our mission </s> <s> We set a goal and arranged our schedule so that we could visit every apartment in the mission to check for safety and to review with our missionaries what to do in case of an earthquake </s> <s> What a wonderful experience we have had as we have met with them and shared scriptures with them about being spiritually and physically prepared </s> if ye are prepared ye shall not fear (D C 38 30 </s> <s> We instructed every missionary to have a go-bag (36 hour kit </s> <s> We reviewed our emergency action plan with them of where to go and what to do if they had phone

words of the Lord 's chosen apostle Elder Scott we had listened and heeded the quiet but clear promptings of the Holy Ghost </s> <s> We were blessed with peace in the midst of chaos </s> <s> We

DATE I love the table and chairs set in the photo but I am not at all willing to spend DATE on two chairs and DATE for the table as shown in the catalog </s> <s> The biggest feature I love is the storage under the table and I found this adorable KidKraft table and chair set for only DATE Just think about it for a little more than the cost of one Land of Nod Chair you can get an entire set Or if you like the look of the warm wood with the colorful chairs you can opt for the KidKraft Euro Honey Table with Four Chairs for only DATE I looked at places like Amazon and Wal-Mart and they were DATE higher than Allkidsfurniture com Notice the cute polka dot mat under the table in the photo Land of Nod sells these Splat Mats for DATE I found one at JazzyJem 's Artfire shop for only DATE which inludes shipping So let 's do the math Land of Nod Play Room DATE Cheapskate Knock Off Playroom DATE which includes the storage organizer and the more expensive table and chair set Pretty Impressive

Wilkie as a writer I saw an interview where he described him as 'm ediocre and in Drood the character is portrayed as a not very talented second-rate author who is consumed with jealousy of the more

's the thing though forget about all the history behind it for a second </s> <s> The Bondwoman 's Narrative is a gripping tale </s> <s> Apparently the author was heavily influenced by books like Bleak House and Jane Eyre I ve only read Jane Eyre of those two but I 'm not sure I would have spotted the connections although scholars have pointed out many direct similarities between TBW 's N and these two texts and there are all kinds of creepy and dramatic events that pull the reader into the story </s> <s> A hatchet with hair still stuck to the heft trees haunted by spirits still furious at their unjust treatment while alive women driven mad conniving business dealings and yes this includes the business of human trade ): this is not a dry historical narrative but a fantastic yarn </s> <s> Nonetheless a yarn with considerable import </s> <s> As potentially the first known novel written by an African American woman this novel is significant for being one of few of that time period that took the author 's race as the norm </s> <s> Unlike other narratives of that time period which were sometimes even written under pseudonyms by white women pretending to write an escape-from-slavery chronicle true abolitionists or simply opportunists who envied Harriet Beecher Stowe 's incredible success with her DATE novel Uncle Tom 's Cabin the black characters in The Bondwoman 's Narrative are never described in stereotypical terms and the presumption is that characters are black unless otherwise described </s> <s> This is the exception rather than the rule for manuscripts dating to this time period so it 's certainly possible to read this novel for scholarly reasons but too much emphasis on its importance might discourage readers who if they just approached this as a 19th-Century Sentimental novel might just find it a good read </s> <s> Surely a book can be both important and enjoyable </s> <s> Anyone else read something lately that they were surprised to find themselves truly enjoying even though they might have originally chosen the book because it was culturally or historically significant I am running out of cliches to express how much Sarah Waters rocks me like a hurricane nbsp Seriously nbsp She is amazeballs nbsp When she is good she is very very good and when she is bad she is still pretty damned good nbsp Admit it The Night Watch only kind of sucked because it wasn t Fingersmith </s> <s> And to be fair Affinity nbsp Also not Fingersmith nbsp Ok but come on you guys nbsp SPIRIT MEDIUMS and SECRETS and spinster ladies who are recovering from the deaths of their fathers and then also something else horrible that they re not telling you about and also VICTORIAN LADY PRISONS nbsp You would like read </s> <s> Ok so nbsp Margaret is a spinster lady who is visiting women in prison because that is the sort of benevolent thing ladies did in those days to guide them in the ways of not being felons and also nbsp so that the benevolent ladies didn t go stark raving mad while living at home with their mothers and being spinsters nbsp Also something horrible happened to her and no one is talking about it but everyone is mentioning it obliquely and nbsp glancing significantly at everyone else nbsp Prepare to feel out of the loop </s> <s> But then Margaret meets Selina prisoner-slash-spirit-medium and if you are at all familiar with La Waters you will be all I SEE YOU COMING LADY ROMANCE nbsp And if you are not well you have eyes nbsp And I really want other things to have happened so that I can delineate them for you but for the rest of the novel Margaret goes to visit Selina in prison and that is sort of it for nbsp many many pages nbsp then something Fairly Unexpected happens at the end nbsp So </s> <s> And it is awesome and atmsopheric and there may or may not be spooks nbsp Waters can toss a word salad like she was born to it nbsp I literally have nothing else to say about this novel nbsp I 'm going to start just

highly evocative way producing in the child a sense of some profound continuity with natural processes and presenting overt evidence of a biological basis of intuition Play for the infant Winnicott argued happened in a space with neither inner psychic reality nor external reality He describes a dialectic between merging with mother and separation that is reduplicated with every nonliving object

about the environment the first favourable outcome happens an abundance of individual symbols and fascinations projected onto the environment the potential space becomes filled with the products of the baby 's own creative imagination The landscape where childhood play is allowed becomes 's acred to the individual as the place where she experiences creative living This is the world of play characterized by a sense of wonder free enjoyment and easy association that Winnicott lauds as giving children a sense of the fullness of their own potential and the many riches of experience </s> <s> It takes the form of turning any landscape into a magical wonderland invested with the potential of encountering fairies or taking adventure </s> <s> The second outcome Winnicott argued would happen in cases of failure of environmental reliability when a baby absorbs adults perspectives on the environment </s> <s> This form of learning teaches the child about zones of danger and safety but discourages play and so Winnicott concludes is less consistent with the individual development of an internal life of the ability to critique authority or of risk-taking behavior outside </s> <s> Individual imagination in safe childhood exploration of landscape was thus set up against collective order of the environment and the manufacture of a disciplined uncritical subject </s> <s> Most adults Winnicott argues have experience of both playspace and discipline </s> <s> Mature adults can return to access their mental worlds of play the space of unintegration which he defines as a day-dream-like state where fantasy dream and real world meet inner projections applied and then separated from real-world objects the limits of self and other readjusted </s> <s> Only by relating to

<s> In class today we were discussing an article which brought up the topic of Reinforcement or Motivation Of course it was in relation to what extent we as Speech-language clinicians should reinforce good behaviour in our child clients or whether we should let intrinsic motivation guide their behavior </s> <s> We defined reinforcement as anything external to the child such as giving stickers and motivation being the child 's own reasons for learning </s> <s> In one study there was a group of children were told that they would be given a prize when they finished a drawing activity there was another group of kids that didn t know they would get a reward until the end of the activity and one group who received no prize at all </s> <s> The study showed that the children initially told that they would receive a prize for their drawing were drawing less in the classroom afterwards and that drawing became an instrumental means to receive an award </s> <s> Overall these types of studies have shown that rewards have a significant negative effect on intrinsic motivation I got to thinking about this and its application to my experiences with choral music and I feel that my intrinsic motivation to sing is really what drives my passion </s> <s> I always find that whenever I am offered money to sing </s> my relationship with the music changes </s> <s> It no longer is a passion for me since performing the music is just another job </s> <s> Of course I would be lying to say I didn t enjoy the fact that I get paid for gigs occasionally however I can t honestly say that my most musically fulfilling experiences occurred when I was paid to sing </s> <s> I understand that performing is part of an artists livelihood but do we ever reach a point where we are just doing another job and we re not being musically satisfied anymore I know many musicians are possibly reading this and I would love to get their input on this matter </s> <s> Therefore dear readers what are your thoughts Does internal motivation guide your happiness or do you feel like monetary reinforcement plays a role in shaping your happiness response as well It doesn t even have to be choral or music related since I find this is a topic applicable to all areas </s> <s> I d love to hear your thoughts in the comments section below Greetings I must say that last night 's Broadway Gala was extremely fun and definitely the least stressful Gala I have ever experienced </s> <s> I think it was due in part to the fact that Belle Canto didn t have too many numbers so I wasn t doing rapid-fire costume changes in the wings of the stage and I actually had time to just hang out in the green room and watch the other performances </s> <s> However it did feel strange to be so idle when there was still so much backstage chaos going on </s> <s> The first half of the evening were song selections revolving around the theme of Family from Seven Brides for Seven Brothers The Sound of Music Gypsy Anne of Green Gables White Christmas and Cinderella and the second half were songs from The Fi ler on the Roof </s> <s> I have to get it out now I must say a special thanks for the amazing men 's chorus this year It 's staggering to think that these men return year after year to help us out with the Broadway Gala given the amount of work they have to go through every year </s> <s> They definitely had a lot of work in store for them this year with the male chorus demands in Seven Brides for Seven Brothers and Fi ler on the Roof </s> <s> You may wonder how a treble-centric choral program manages to find men but it is all through the connections of our choristers </s> <s> Fathers husbands brothers friends random strangers---these men comprise our male chorus </s> <s> The only unfortunate thing this year was that Belle Canto and the Men 's Chorus didn t have any duet numbers since I only have fond memories of knocking on coconut bras of the men from last year 's South Pacific </s> <s> I watched the first half of the concert from the Green Room t v </s> so it was hard for me to hear exactly everything that was going on but it seemed like everything appeared to run smoothly </s> <s> The Goin Courtin 's ong from Seven Brides for Seven Brothers was extremely cute when 2 Belle Canto lasses were showing the proper courting ways for the socially unrefined brothers </s> <s> There was a point where each of the men took turns two-stepping with the gals and it was hilarious to watch their purposefully off-beat dance steps as they tossed the ladies around </s> <s> The numbers from Anne of Green Gables Cinderella and Gypsy were mainly small group or solo numbers and they all were carried off wonderfully from soloists from the choir </s> <s> I do have to say and I am not alone in this that the highlight of the first half was definitely the songs from the Sound of Music and specifically the lovely little Mia playing Gretel in So Long Farewell The unphased little Mia sat in the mi le of the stage all by herself and sang the solo line with confidence and charm </s> <s> I watched from the backstage t v 's and my friend Nicole put it very well in saying that the performance was so gutwrenchingly cute that her ovaries felt it </s> <s> The second half with Fi ler on the Roof brought all the choirs on stage for the mass numbers and I must admit I was winging it for a few of the pieces </s> <s> Due to the fact that I was in Montreal for most of the week and missed out on 3 of the large rehearsals I was definitely lagging behind in choreography precision </s> <s> I knew my steps for the solo Belle Canto numbers such as for Sister 's and The Dream from Fi ler but everything else was new to me </s> <s> I appreciated the help of my fellow choristers tweaking my movements in Fi ler during the dress rehearsal which was right before the performance and I just watched others for the cues in Sabbath Prayer Anatevka and Sunrise Sunset </s> <s> Also thanks to Amy from Belle Canto for gathering up some Belle 's to run through Sisters with me backstage </s> <s> Sure it wasn t my best Broadway Gala performance to date but I had fun and I know my slight mishaps didn t ruin the show </s> <s> The most challenging was The Dream and it wasn t due to the fact that I didn t know what I was doing movement-wise but lining up words with an improvised piano part was not easy </s> <s> Especially when we needed to get notes from piano </s> <s> However I am not here to dwell on the negative </s> <s> It was an extremely fun performance overall and I must give kudos to Steven who played Tevye for many of the Fi ler songs </s> <s> Maybe it just worked out that he 's the husband of our choir conductor but we managed to maximize on his talent in the past few years </s> <s> He played the she-male Edna from Hairspray last year and his comedic flaire for Tevye was spot on this year </s> <s> Plus it makes me smile to think of how he is a Geology academic by day but a community Broadway star by night :) Overall our 9th Broadway Gala was a success in my eyes minus some small missteps missed notes and funky piano improv on some of the songs </s> <s> It 's a bit of a chaotic production every year but I wouldn t have it any other way :) Enjoy some of the pictures from the evening The men 's chorus in Fi ler on the Roof Photo Credit Stephen L </s> <s> Chamber Choir singing Do-Re-Mi from The Sound of Music Photo Credit Stephen L </s> <s> Touching up makeup backstage An array of costumes from the evening Relaxing in the Green Room A cozy self-portrait My dress for the sisters number </s> <s> I originally brought a black dress (s ince I wasn t sure on what the costume verdit was as I kept on getting continuous e-mails from people changing their mind while I was away in Montreal but I noticed that lots of people had color dresses on during the dress rehearsal </s> <s> Due to the fact that our choreographer Adam said he was more focused on looking at people 's dresses I figured another black dress wasn t the most simulating so I called my mom to bring this dress that has been sitting in my closet for a while </s> <s> Sometimes I feel sorry for my pretty clothing pieces that never get to be worn so I 'm glad this dress was able to have a night out </s> <s> I believed it all worked out well and you can probably tell from the first photo in this post

McGill Schulich School of Music around noon after her morning practising </s> <s> We headed off to Simons yet again for some shopping but then ended over in the hip Plateau area on St </s> <s> Laurent street for lunch </s> <s> At the advice of Jeremy we went over to Cafe Santropol for their delicious sandwiches </s> <s> In my mind I was expecting a bakery-like place that served sandwiches on the side but the exter ior of this restaurant looked like an ordinary house </s> <s> Indeed inside the restaurant was a home-turned-restaurant and we grabbed a table in the sun-room at the back of the house </s> <s> There was a cute patio outside which I can only imagine is very lovely in the summertime </s> <s> The sandwiches were made on their signature Cafe Santropol bread and Leanne postulated that molasses was the secret ingredient to give the bread its rich color </s> <s> There were so many delicious sandwich options but I ended up settling on one with smoked ham with apple and mint jelly </s> <s> It was so refreshing and light I can t wait to go back next time and try their other inventive sandwich options </s> <s> After lunch we did some vintage shopping on St </s> <s> Laurent and one of the highlights was walking into a store where the sales girl looked like she walked out of the 50s era with her red lips jet-black tied back into a chic roll thick-framed glasses and vibrant cropped sweater </s> <s> The store was full of hi en gems with showcases full of cat-rimmed glasses shelves with evening clutches from the DATEs and hanging displays of vintage brass broaches </s> <s> I appreciated the fact that this vintage store was extremely non-junky since it 's no fun to go vintage shopping and you re sniffling because everything is dusty and old </s> <s> It started snowing and getting chilly near the end of our shopping trip so we headed back to Leanne 's place to start on dinner for the evening </s> <s> She made a delicious vegetarian casserole and baked vegan chocolate brownies for dessert </s> <s> Again we topped off the evening by viewing multiple episodes of GLEE as well as watching the Olympics men 's hockey shootout between Canada and Sweden </s> <s> Exciting times Now I am back in Edmonton and getting myself organized for the Cantilon Broadway Gala I ll be performing at tomorrow </s> <s> If you re in the Edmonton St </s> <s> Albert area you

amazing yesterday the Sparrow is equal if not better </s> <s> I was assured everything on the menu was delicious and it was </s> <s> The restaurant is run by a chef who worked under Gordon Ramsay in London and the Sparrow embraces gastropub food </s> <s> Thus uniting liquor and delicious eats to go along with it </s> <s> I also heard they have a killer brunch </s> too bad I 'm not here until the weekend The restaurant design was also quaint and cute with a lovely sparrow patterned wallpaper on one side of the restaurant </s> <s> Afterward Leanne and I ventured off to find Fairmont Bagels where she picked up many delicious hand-rolled bagels </s> <s> We walked down St </s> <s> Denis and did some shopping and when we parted ways where she headed off to rehearsal I took a break from walking in the cold and went to go get some hot chocolate at Juliette et Chocolat </s> <s> I remember last time I visited Juliette et Chocolat I had a bit too much chocolate and had an intense sugar buzz afterwards </s> <s> This is because their hot chocolate isn t some watered-down powder mix </s> <s> You re drinking actual melted chocolate mixed with cream </s> <s> This time I didn t overdose and the experience was much more enjoyable </s> <s> I just sat there drinking liquid chocolate gold and eating a sundae topped with brownies strawberries bananas and chocolate fondue sauce while reading the online news from my cell phone </s> <s> After this I did some more shopping in the area before meeting back up with Leanne after her Contemporary Music Ensemble rehearsal at McGill </s> <s> Leanne was famished so we went to find La Banquise for some delicious Montreal poutine </s> <s> This restaurant is 24h and I have fond memories of its greasy and satisfying dishes </s> <s> My friend and I searched for this restaurant by walking uphill on icy streets with killer windchill and I remember the sweet warm smell of victory when the aroma of freshly fried food was in the air </s> <s> La Banquise was a greasy comfort-food haven for us and it has not changed </s> <s> I opted for the Poutine Dan Dan this time where crispy fries were topped off with pepperoni bacon onions and cheese all smothered in gravy </s> <s> Greasy heart-attack inducing food never tasted so good We headed back to her apartment and enjoyed viewing Chickasaw a musical DVD gifted to me by Donald Patriquin yesterday </s> <s> I also topped off that viewing by introducing Leanne to GLEE and we watched the pilot together </s> <s> How I love that show Just one more day in the city I am traveling away in Montreal and I have a few highlighted snapshots to show for it :) Started out in Verdun QC walking from Leanne and Jeremy 's apartment to the metro Heading up to the Plateau area to have lunch at Reservoir a restaurant recommended to me by my sister </s> <s> So delicious The restaurant had a laid-back vibe but the food is gourmet in a non-pretentious way </s> <s> The menu was all in French on a chalkboard and I ordered something where I recognized the words 's almon and apple but I wasn t wholly sure of what the dish was </s> <s> However I did find out it was a pan fried salmon which was topped off with deep fried sweet onions on a baked slice of apple </s> <s> I know it sounds like a strange combination but it was so inventive and appetizing </s> <s> I have never tasted anything in my life like it </s> <s> To top it off I got warm crusty bread to go along with my latte Then I was off to a concert at St </s> <s> James United Church to see Leanne play in her string trio </s> <s> In between waiting for busses to arrive and dodging hobos at church entrances I couldn t get into I unfortunately was late and missed their piece since they were first in the program </s> <s> But I did catch the other performers and they sounded great </s> <s> The church was also a really nice venue for music </s> <s> After the concert I met up with Canadian composer Donald Patriquin and chatted about music over sushi </s> <s> What an excellent combination We did a gift swap at the end where I passed along some music from the Cantilon Chamber Choir and he shared a DVD with a musical he wrote music and directed call Chickasaw He also gave me a reusable bag with a Nietzsche quote in French Life without music is an error to bring a hopeful reminder that I made the right choice about not going on the choir tour after reading my post Choral Apathy </s> <s> Then I was off to St </s> <s> Catherine 's for shopping I raided of Simons thoroughly and afterward I gawked at beautiful things I can t afford at Ogilvy 's </s> <s> Since I had time I went to Schwartz for a smoked Montreal meat sandwich </s> <s> I was told that I HAD to eat here and after dodging the hobo outside the door lots of hobo run-in 's today I enjoyed a deli sandwich at the counter </s> <s> It was delicious but there was just SO much meat </s> <s> I couldn t even see the bread I had to divide what I thought was the midway point of the sandwich and eat 4 separate pieces with a fork and knife </s> <s> It 's very much a eat-and-go restaurant since there 's always a line-up but I think it would be a much more relaxing dining experience if I went back with some more people next time </s> <s> Then I took the bus back to the McGill area and had a chai latte at Art Java </s> <s> It was nice to just sit down and read the McGill student newspaper </s> <s> Olympic news was also on the t v </s> so I enjoyed how people were in Stanley Park golfing since the weather was so nice and warm for the

Choir my first tour was to Regina SK after that was Vancouver BC following that was my first international tour where we went to Wales for the Llangollen Music Festival then there was a mini choir

choir I know they would all be happy to have me there but it 's the first time where life has interfered with my choral passions </s> <s> The reason I will not be able to head off to Italy and have

last year after accepting my place in the program I toyed with the idea of going to Italy </s> maybe even just for the weekend Show up compete in the classes and then head back to Canada without missing on any major coursework or clinic time My mind buzzed with this possibility Maybe it was possible to have the best of both worlds Alas the stress of not knowing what I would be missing until July arrived and by that point already having my tickets booked just didn t cut it for me </s> <s> Also I usually extend my trip and travel after the competition (s ince I 'm already over there but a

thoughts I ve really tried to write my entries in an engaging way since I do believe that there are still people not completely sold on the idea of choral music </s> <s> It probably doesn t help that

<s> I ve earned a BA in Political Science and Spanish Language Literature from the George Washington University and an MA in Communications from Georgetown University </s> <s> HOW DID YOU GET STARTED

programmers </s> <s> The bulk of my experience is in creating interactive and print campaigns and products for hospitality travel automotive and consumer products companies in the US and Europe </s> <s> And while I ve always been co mfortable collaborating with brand managers and market researchers and account executives I ve often felt that working with my design teams was harder than it needed to be </s> <s> I 'm not sure if this was due to my lack of hands-on design experience not sharing the same vocabulary some fundamental gap between left-brain and right-brain personalities </s> <s> But as the guy ultimately responsible for the quality of our work I was determined to find a way to improve my interaction with my designers </s> <s> My approach was to take classes at the Corcoran College of Art Design everything from Photoshop and InDesign to drawing photography lighting design for interiors and graphic design </s> <s> A few years back I replaced a can celed class with screenprinting and was absolutely amazed by the powerful emotional and physical connection I felt in the studio </s> <s> The physicality of the process infinite opportunities to follow traditional techniques or to experiment with new approaches the joy of creating multiples it all had me hooked right from the start </s> <s> DESCRIBE WHERE YOU WORK The bulk of my printing happens in the print studio at the Corcoran which is in the basement of a really old former public school building in DC </s> <s> It 's a great space to learn the basics </s> <s> It 's on the smaller side so you learn quickly how to work in close quarters with other printers how to move carefully between printers as you carry your prints to the rack how to be aware of those moving around you with prints or pots of ink or the random sharp pointy object </s> <s> Our equipment is anything but fancy wood and aluminum screens clamped to work tables no cool vacuum tables or anything like that </s> <s> And it certainly isn t new our racks and floors and tables and washout room are layered with spots and smears of ink scratches rust dents a subtle reminder that there 's history all around us the collective creativity and sweat and effort of all the students and masters who ve printed before us </s> <s> T hat makes the space inspiring and as cramped and frustrating as it can be it feel s like home </s> <s> WHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE PRINTMAKING PROCESS Screenprinting definitely </s> <s> I studied intaglio many years ago with master printer Scip Barnhart which was really a great experience </s> <s> But as much as I enjoyed the process it 's so much slower than screenprinting </s> <s> And much more dependent on my ability to draw which is probably one of my least-developed skills </s> <s> So while I enjoy it most of my intaglio work would probably be stick figures interacting with other stick figures </s> <s> Screenprinting on the other hand well that 's a whole different ballgame </s> <s> My creative process for screenprinting is fueled in so many ways by my photography through abstract designs or compositions in Photoshop or Illustrator or more traditionally through non-digital processes </s> <s> I 'm able to envision an d create much more effectively and I think at a higher level through screenprinting than I would with any other process </s> <s> WHAT S YOUR CREATIVE PROCESS FOR ANY GIVEN PRINT EG </s> <s> SKETCH FIRST PRE-PLANNED OR FREE-FORM My best prints - or at least the ones I feel are the most successful - start out from my photographs </s> <s> I try to travel to interesting places though recently thanks economy those places have been much closer to home </s> <s> P laces like Philadelphia shooting well-known but very interesting places l ike Eastern State Penitentiary or Smith Island Maryland which is home of the many-layered Smith Island Cake </s> <s> I ll even drive for hours and hours to places like Centralia PA which is what 's left of an entire town destroyed by a coal mine fire </s> <s> Places with history with a unique story with some kind of beauty and meaning </s> <s> I then pul l everything into Photoshop or Illustrator to experiment with texture tone balance all the little t weaks needed to pull together an exciting composition </s> <s> Sometimes there 's a lot of manipulation involved as with my print El Gran Gallo where the original photograph is substantially transformed into a graphic print </s> <s> Other times the digital work is very minimal as with Gull where Photoshop was used merely to create CMYK separations the print clearly reflecting its photographic origins </s> <s> Finally it 's into the studio where I try to challenge mysel f with each new project working with new color palettes techniques that are new and unusual or sizes or aspect ratios that I haven t worked with before </s> <s> WHAT DO YOU ENJOY MOST ABOUT PRINTMAKING The night before I go into the studio I ll spend some time doing a mental walk-through of my battle plan about everything that needs to be done about the best timing order where things can go wrong </s> <s> I try to anticipate problems and how to keep them from happening </s> <s> So by the time I get into the studio I have a fairly good idea of what needs to happen when and how I can act and react if anything funky happens </s> <s> What I love about printmaking then is when I get into the studio and the day unfolds much like I ve visualized it </s> <s> I 'm in the zone everything is breaking my way </s> <s> My film looks just like I want it the emulsion isn t too old and is holding the detail of my images nicely </s> <s> There 's plenty of room to work I 'm getting my inks together without much hassle </s> <s> And when the printing begins it 's almost on automatic pour flood drop pull lift flood repeat </s> <s> I spin gingerly on one foot and carry my prints to the rack the other printers in the studio moving deftly aside as I scoot by </s> <s> There 's a harmony a synchronicity between us </s> <s> My head 's down I 'm doing good work the rhythm and pacing are spot on </s> <s> Can t get enough of that feeling </s> <s> WHAT S YOUR LEAST FAVORITE PART OF THE PROCESS I hate picking colors for my prints </s> <s> I am woefully unschooled in color theory though I do generally know a good color combination when I see one </s> <s> But my knowledge and skill in this area are very rough unrefined </s> <s> I 'm certainly not delicate when it comes to color and often default to bold colors because I just don t trust myself outside of this comfort zone </s> <s> I ve been aching to take a color theory class for years but haven t had any luck so far </s> <s> Fortunately my instructors Manuel Navarette and Carolyn Hartmann have been extremely gracious in sharing little color theory insights with me suggesting better combinations or directions for particular projects </s> <s> But I d very much l ike to take color theory so I can embrace this part of the process more fully make it more my own </s> <s> WHAT ARE YOUR INSPIRATIONS OTHER ARTISTS PEOPLE PLACES EVENTS ETC In the last 15 years or so there are three artists who have really inspired me to embrace artistic pursuits </s> <s> First is Scip Barnhart my intaglio instructor who gave me my first taste of the technical skill and creative processes required to create something meaningful beautiful fulfilling </s> <s> More recently are two New Orleans artists Matt Rinard and Robert Guthrie </s> <s> I ve been collecting their work for years and have been surrounded at home by their prints and originals and bits of sculpture </s> <s> Each time I catch a glimpse of their work some little emotional part of me think s fondly of New Orleans and an overwhelming sense of happiness wash es over me </s> <s> L et me make it clear that I 'm absolutely in no way comparing my work to the awesomeness these guys create but knowing how happy their art makes me I thought it would be really amazingly cool to see if I could find something within m e some creativity some passion that could give a bit of that happiness to others </s> <s> And it goes without saying that I d be absolutely nowhere in any of this without the attention support and dedication of my instructors Carolyn and Manuel </s> <s> HOW HAS YOUR WORK CHANGED AND EVOLVED SINCE YOU STARTED It 's important to understand that when I walked into the studio that very first day I had absolutely no idea what I was getting into </s> <s> None </s> <s> Yeah I d had that intaglio experience with Scip years earlier but wow such a different process diff erent tools different mindset </s> <s> So I was really starting from scratch </s> <s> My first year or so was spent focused on the basics developing the muscle memory of the right way to pull the squeegee across my screen developing a fluidity of movement in my personal printing process becoming familiar with the temperament of the inks and acrylic base how they change based on environmental circumstances how to coax them into doing what I want them to do with a little bit of airbrush cleaner </s> <s> My prints in this time were very traditional straightforward examples pretty much just ink on paper </s> <s> But throughout that first year I did two important things </s> <s> First I asked questions a lot of questions </s> <s> I 'm sure I drove my instructors a little nuts </s> <s> Second I searched bookstores and galleries and the internet for more information on screenprinting but also generally about all types of printmaking </s> <s> So over the course of that year I learned for example about metallic powders and glass beads and me coflock and the use of adhesives </s> <s> I learned about very interesting techniques using wax and oil

Commonwealth Writers Prize DATE short list thanks Leela Soma and Rob </s> <s> It 's a slim little volume with a most intriguing cover art of a pretty Chinese lady with what appears to be sightless eyes </s> <s> When friends and I first saw the cover design we had a nice discussion of what that might signify was she looking inside herself or was she deliberately refusing to 's ee that which is obvious to everyone else Don t you just love cover art that intrigues I did some research on the art and found out it has been taken from the Reed Darmon collection </s> <s> Reed Darmon is the person responsible for the Made in China graphics book and you can learn more about it here </s> <s> To come back to the stories all twelve invoke Beijing in some way or the other even if the stories themselves vary widely in time period and location </s> <s> The most notable aspect of Tel 's storytelling is how he recounts modern facts about China but interwoven with Chinese folk tales and

out on his Journey to the West with A Journey to the West being the title of this much-loved legend and folk tale </s> <s> Another trait I noticed is his ability to blend old China with the new and no story illustrates that better than The Most Beautiful Woman In China which links together two thousand years of Chinese history while being set in Beijing today One generic character that makes his or her appearance in many of the stories is the Chinese migrant and after reading a lot of topical articles on China I have come to the realization that Beijing even more than Shanghai is a mecca for the Chinese people it is the land of opportunity the land where dreams come true or as Tel himself describes in the title it is the land full of possibilities Beijing is the center of the universe </s> <s> Ask anybody who lives there </s> The true Beijinger secretly believes that people living anywhere else have to be in some sense ki ing in a foreword by Helan Xiao One of my favorite migrant characters in this collection is from the title story </s> <s> Miss Xu is a fisherman 's daughter but foster 'm other to the child of a young couple in Beijing </s> <s> The couple have hired Miss Xu to look after their as-yet-unborn child because they are too busy to care for the child themselves in ten or twelve years time they ll be ready to take the child to live with them </s> <s> Unfortunately the child dies before they could hand it over to Miss Xu but because she had been registered in Bejing as a foster mother Miss Xu lands herself an unexpected ticket to residency in Beijing which is to most Chinese what an American green card is to refugees Ofcourse being a hick from Hainan a sleepy little fishing village she was treated as an outcast in Beijing which makes for a very moving story </s> <s> Tel also has this ability to infuse his stories with playful plots and language </s> <s> Amusing but a little sad too is The Book of Auspicious and Inauspicious Dreams where a young modern couple during renovations to their DATE 's home chance upon a rusty tin of souvenirs buried in a wall of their suburban Beijing house </s> <s> Realizing it must belong to the previous owner they do everything to try to return the tin only to be met with exclamations of protests from the previous owner who insisted she had never laid eyes on the tin before and that she loved Chairman Mao more than her own mother and father which reminds the reader of a turbulent time in China 's history where to be a lover of the arts or to have western things meant having a bourgeois background which in turn meant being sent to the villages for reeducation something that was a tough and humiliating experience for most intellectuals </s> <s> I found a couple of the stories had the overall effect of looking at a subtly distorted mirror but for the most part Tel 's prose and plots are smart entertaining observant and insightful </s> <s> It 's most definitely a collection to cherish </s> <s> Oh and before I go </s> <s> I haven t been able to explain the girl on the cover </s> <s> My best guess is that she is Little Yu from the heart warmingly sad story The Three Lives of Little Yu about a childless couple who adopt a little girl whom they call Yu only to have her snatched away by the god of death </s> <s> They adopt a second girl and call her Yu too but the same fate awaits her </s> <s> When the third girl again called Yu enters their family it is implied that she is a reincarnation of the previous little girls </s> <s> So could the girl on the cover have been Yu

think of Somalia we think civil war Somali pirates Islamic fundamentalism so how very refreshing to chance upon Black Mamba Boy which takes us back to a thriving Somalia of yesteryear and not just Somalia but Djibouti Sudan Eritrea Egypt a veritable tour of North-East Africa in the mid-30 's </s> <s> Let me explain :\ Black Mamba Boy by Somali-British author Nadifa Mohamed is based on the true story of the author 's father 's life </s> <s> Opening in DATE 's Aden we are introduced to Jama a ten year-old Somali boy a street kid whose mother dies unexpectedly thus leaving him alone in this world Jama is forced home to his native Somalia the land of his nomadic ancestors </s> <s> War is on the horizon and the fascist Italian forces who control parts of east Africa are preparing for battle </s> <s> Yet Jama cannot rest until he discovers whether his father who has been absent from his life since he was a baby is alive somewhere </s> <s> And so begins an epic journey which will take Jama north through Djibouti war-torn Eritrea and Sudan to Egypt </s> <s> And from there aboard a ship transporting Jewish refugees just released from German concentration camp across the seas to Britain and freedom OK my challenge here as a reviewer is how to give you my impressions without gushing or using a great many superlatives so I ll just say this if you choose to read the book you re in for an amazing ride through the dusty noisy but bustling streets of the some of the most important cities of North East Africa in the 30 's </s> <s> From the vast sandy deserts of Sudan to narrow busy alleys in Somalia from the tree-lined manicured boulevards of Djibouti to the emerald-green landscape with juicy mango trees of Abyssinia you will see it all Mohamed 's prose zings with the vibrancy of North African life an unfamiliar landscape of strange tribes and tongues bizarre rituals superstitions and tribal kinship </s> <s> The sensitive way in which she handles Jama 's relationships with his family and kinsmen tugs at one 's heartstrings </s> <s> In a historical context I cannot vouch for Mohamed 's accuracy because I know so little about that area and in that time period but it is told so well you get completely swept up by the events and happenings </s> <s> But central to the story is suffering the suffering of the African people at the hands of their colonizers </s> <s> Mohamed 's acute and unsparing descriptive powers render vivid everything from Aden street chaos to traditional Palestinian we ing in Khan Younis but her clipped depiction of the death by torture of a young Somalian man at the hands of two drunk Italians made me gasp out loud and pushed me way out of my comfort zone into a place I wasn t sure I wanted to be </s> <s> And that 's not a bad thing because when I read I want to be astonished I want to be moved I want to be shaken to the core and Mohamed succeeds in doing this </s> <s> Having said all this though for me the most moving part of the account is when Jama finds employment as a deck hand on board the Runnymede Park at Haifa Palestine Runnymede Park was a British prison ship carrying thousands of Jewish refugees originally from Auschwitz Bergen-Belsen and Treblinka who were denied permission to disembark in Palestine their Promised Land but instead taken back to Europe to be made an example out of thereby deterring other would-be Jewish immigrants from making the trip to Palestine </s> <s> Her descriptions of the agony (p hysical and mental that the poor refugees suffered are so vivid I could literally hear the crash of broken dreams and feel the dejection in my own chest </s> <s> If you enjoy Africa history travel the story weaves its way through a labyrinth of countries stories of exile and survival this one is definitely for you Hardcover DATE pages Publisher Little Brown and Company 1 edition Jun 9 DATE Language English Luxurious Hearses is this (\ Say You re One of Them collection 's fourth and longest story but perhaps its most important </s> <s> I see it as important because more than any other story I have read here so far it is this one that brings to life the political economic and religious strife we read so much about in Africa </s> <s> The story set in Nigeria illuminates the political situation of Nigeria the poverty of the people in the Nigerian Delta the tension between the Muslims in the North and the Christians in the south and what happens when innocent people get caught in between </s> <s> After you read this longish nouvella you come away seeing with new eyes why every now and again Nigeria plunges into Muslim-Christian riots and why despite all the oil that Nigeria possesses its people are so poor </s> <s> Our protagonist in this story is a 16-year old boy called Jubril who is forced to head south towards the Christian part of Nigeria after riots broke out in his very-Muslim city of Khamfa which is in the north </s> <s> Ordinarily Jubril may not have had to run away but when his own Muslim friends turned against him for having a Christian father whom he had never seen or known he decided that if he was interested in saving his life it would be prudent for him to leave his town and Muslim mother and her family and head south to be reunited with his Christian dad </s> <s> The story of his journey from the North to South in the midst of some of the worst religious riots Nigeria has ever seen with a host of wonderfully- colourful characters that are his bus companions his fears and insecurities about heading to a part of the country that is so alien to him and his perpetual fear of being found out as a Muslim in bus full of Christian refugees is riveting suspenseful and unputdownable The reader is as tense as Jubril who is forced to try and blend in with the other people on the bus a task made much more difficult because his right hand was lopped off when he was arrested for stealing a goat months before </s> <s> As always Akpan 's writing holds you spellbound </s> <s> Most of the story takes place on the bus with occasional flashbacks to Jubrail 's life in Khamfa before he had to flee </s> <s> As a reader you are privy to all the conversations that place on the bus the fears egos anger and other emotions that the passengers bring with them power dynamics between the well off and the not so well off the sick and the healthy </s> <s> Many a time like Oprah I got so claustrophobic from being on that bus I had this strong urge to jump off and yet the writing and the thought of what might happen next kept me glued to the pages An Ex-Mas Feast was audacious The Fattening of Gabon was downright sad but Luxurious Hearses is gruesome </s> <s> You re going to need a strong stomach to endure the second half of the novel </s> <s> Gruesome it might be but at no point do you get the feeling the author is aiming for sensationalism instead you come away feeling deeply for the characters the victims and the persecutors alike for you come to understand that each man is simply doing all he can to survive </s> <s> Since each of the five stories in this book are set in different countries in Africa you might want to use Howard French 's A Continent for the Taking or even Richard Dowden 's Africa Altered States Ordinary Miracles as a companion read </s> <s> I found both very helpful in explaining Africa to me Fattening for Gabon is Uwem Akpan 's second story nouvella length at DATE pages in the collection Say You re One of Them </s> <s> It starts off innocently enough with a young (10- year old boy narrating how his maternal uncle offers to take him and his 5-year old sister to live with him on the border of Benin and Gabon because the boy 's parents are dying of AIDS and too poor and sick to look after the children but the story very gradually starts to take on a sinister tone which gets completely brutal towards the end </s> Selling your child or nephew could be more difficult than selling other kids that is the blunt line with which Fattening for Gabon begins </s> <s> I wish so much Akpan hadn t used that opening line because it really does give it all away </s> <s> The story is so beautifully written that had Akpan waited to reveal this say about halfway through the story I think the reader would have been shaken to the core and which reader doesn t mind being shaken Anyway what 's done is done and this other child-narrated story succeeds in provoking the whole gamut of emotions from incredulity to disgust and from confusion to absolute fear in the reader </s> <s> For me the biggest issue here was child manipulation I could have screamed at all of the adults in this story and cheerfully lined up against a wall to be shot </s> <s> I know I know some of you might think I am over reacting but you know when Uwem Akpan was interviewed he stated that all these stories were drawn from real people he met and counselled in his years as a Jesuit Priest </s> <s> Just to know that there are adults like this makes my blood boil </s> <s> Again as in the previous story one of Akpan 's strengths is in how he slips into the skins of his characters no matter what gender or age they might be </s> <s> He also has such a gift for description and narration </s> <s> There are several scenes that stand out for me in this story the main one being the Thanksgiving service at church that Fofo Kpee the uncle organizes in order to give thanks for his ill-begotten gain </s> <s> Akpan describes the procession the dancing the characters their clothes the gifts the priest 's invocations the offertory to god and the elation the family feels to be given so much importance on that day so vividly it is literally like watching the service unfold on a cinematic screen </s> <s> What a writer this man is Something I liked very much and that 's probably because I listened to this on audio as well as read it in print is Akpan 's frequent use of the local dialect in the dialogue </s> <s> Four colloquial languages were used in this particular story </s> <s> English French Idaatcha and Egun sometimes in the same paragraph </s> <s> I have spoken to people who found that distracting not me I guess knowing a little French does help speed the read along </s> <s> Last but not least the title is very conversation-worthy but that I 'm afraid will be a

stories and because they are all so stunning revealing and heartbreaking I feel like they deserve to be written about individually rather than together so I here I go with a few thoughts on the first story and a link to where you can read the story for yourself :\ An Ex-Mas Feast about a very young child prostitute and set in a slum in Nairobi can be a tough story to read and if you re feeling particularly fragile it is perhaps not a story you will want to read </s> <s> It 's about tough situations and people just trying to do their best with the rotten cards they ve been dealt </s> <s> Although the lives of these protagonists and their stories will leave you shaking your head Akpan makes no judgement on his characters and neither must you </s> <s> Although this is a short story Akpan manages to bring up several important issues like the importance of education in finding a way out of poverty hunger survival family bonds and the importance of family especially at festival

English Oft late there has been a surge of books that claim to strike at the heart of the Indian immigrant experience and many of them do like Jhumpa Lahiri 's Unaccustomed Earth Manju Kapur 's The Immigrant Bharati Mukherjee 's Desirable Daughters etc </s> <s> But most of these novels are set either in the US or in England so when I heard about Indo-Scot writer Leela Soma 's novel set both in Glasgow and Chennai Madras I knew it was going to be unusual and different because I don t think I ve ever read the experiences of an Indian immigrant in Glasgow before The central characters Ram and Sita are brought together by their families in what is commonly known as an arranged marriage in India </s> <s> Although Sita is a well educated independent young woman who longs to fall in love she allows herself to be talked into marriage with Ram a young medic based in Glasgow because she knows that is what is expected of her </s> <s> I thought Soma captured very well the painful familial expectations that all of us growing up in India have experienced </s> <s> Unfortunately for the couple they have nothing in common </s> <s> Ram is a fastidious and earnest young man who has a hard time showing his emotions </s> <s> Sita is a vivacious intelligent chatty and emotional young lady who simply cannot understand why Ram cannot be more demonstrative caring or expressive </s> <s> Unlike some of the other books with immigration as a theme Sita doesn t have major problems adjusting to her new life in Glasgow </s> <s> After all she is a convent-educated young girl steeped in an English education that was primed and prepared for Cambridge </s> an Indian in every outward way but with the thoughts and aspirations of a liberally-educated mi le class westerner What she cannot come to terms with is having a marriage devoid of romance </s> <s> Sita and Ram soon get caught up in their separate lives but continue to be bound together by duty familial and societal expectations their daughter Uma and other cultural trappings </s> <s> Soma carefully unravels the story of this stifling but moving marriage </s> <s> She does so without melodrama and with careful attention to the couple 's mundane moments of tenderness </s> <s> Both characters are extremely likable but both have their flaws and I found it impossible to take sides </s> <s> The two are ably supported by a chorus of other great characters like BB the resident old gossip Lata Sita 's best friend and confidante Eileen a wee Scottish lass who marries a Muslim doctor only to regret it and Neil Sita 's paramour </s> <s> Beyond the marriage and family this novel deals with the momentous themes of love and belonging it is also an examination of immigration identity walking the tightrope between two distinct cultures and so on </s> <s> Most immigrants inhabit an in-between space that is a little difficult to describe but Leela being an immigrant herself has ably captured and given life to that space when she says and I paraphrase An immigrant 's affection for his or her adopted country and its people ranges from highs to lows </s> <s> On days when homesickness prevails nothing seems right with the city on the other hand the sheer freedom of being able to live life away from the watchful eyes of society and family back home can be exhilarating I thought Soma very ably introduces her readers to Glasgow a city many of us are not so familiar with and I thought her idea of introducing colloquial Scottish phrases through the book helped steep the narrative in local flavour </s> <s> The history and anthropological buffs amongst us will be quite impressed at how the Scots and the people of Madras influenced each other </s> <s> Much of the story is set against the political landscape of Sccotland from the DATE 's to the present day and that makes for interesting reading too </s> <s> This is a story of immigration in the late 70 's (D ATE to be precise and having emigrated from India to Canada in DATE I found it very interesting to compare Sita 's immigration experience with mine </s> <s> I think it 's so much easier today for one thing staying in touch with the home country is a cinch because of the internet also one never has to crave for home food or cooking supplies as almost every neighborhood has its own ethnic stores not to mention cable television companies that beam programmes from India right into your living room </s> <s> Sita had to wait weeks to make a trunk-call when she wanted to speak to her parents however I think it made for a more determined assimilation into one 's adopted culture </s> <s> Today many immigrants continue to live exactly as they did at home </s> <s> They don t feel the need to assimilate and many are not encouraged to </s>

nothing from Now that 's a tough one isn t it Some people are driven to altruistic lengths to help a stranger in need </s> <s> Many will donate money and time or both </s> <s> Some will make radical

room for thinking or planning Little Bee is the story of two such strangers and how their fates intertwine one fateful summer 's day in Nigeria </s> <s> The central theme of the story examines how despite deep-seated convictions life unfairly places a disproportionate emphasis on the decisions we make in split seconds </s> <s> Other prominent themes in the book include asylum seekers the state of detention centers in the UK and issues a challenge to its readers to ponder why the word refugee has become such an ugly word in today 's parlance </s> <s> For instance why is it that in late 60 's and even early 70 's defectors from the then USSR or other European communists state were cheered on and even celebrated as heroes but today we balk at having to share our resources with their countrymen </s> <s> Why do we treat refugees as criminals locking them away until their cases can be heard Why do their cases take so long to hear The novel is a bittersweet one and told in two voices the two main female protagonists that we spoke of earlier in the review </s> <s> This works well because the two women are from opposite sides of the great class divide and by hearing both their voices the reader gets a dual perspective instead of just one </s> <s> About the characters I am not sure I could be friends with any of them in real life but they made for great character studies So to summarize this is a novel that is sad and yet funny serious and yet light-hearted heavy and yet it 's only a wisp of a novel overall a lovely reading experience This novel is called The Other Hand
