<s> In cla <smiley> today we were discu <smiley> ing an article which brought up the topic of 'Reinforcement or Motivation 'Of course it was in relation to what extent we as <smiley> eech-language

finished a drawing activity there was another group of ki <smiley> that didn 't know they would get a reward until the end of the activity and one group who received no prize at all </s> <s> The study showed that the children initially told that they would receive a prize for their drawing were drawing le <smiley> in the cla <smiley> room afterwar <smiley> and that drawing became an instrumental means to receive an award </s> <s> Overall these types of studies have shown that 'rewar <smiley> have a significant negative effect on intrinsic motivation 'I got to thinking about this and its a <smiley> lication to my e <smiley> eriences with choral music and I feel that my intrinsic motivation to sing is really what drives my pa <smiley> ion </s> <s> I always find that whenever I am offered

that performing is part of an artist <smiley> ' livelihood but do we ever reach a point where we are just doing another job and we 're not being musically satisfied anymore I know many musicians are

do you feel like monetary reinforcement plays a role in shaping your ha <smiley> ine <smiley> re <smiley> onse as well It doesn 't even have to be choral or music related since I find this is a topic a <smiley> licable to all areas </s> <s> I 'd love to hear your thoughts in the comments section below Greetings I must say that last night is Broadway Gala was extremely fun and definitely the least stre <smiley> ful Gala I have ever e <smiley> erienced </s> <s> I think it was due in part to the fact that Belle Canto didn 't have too many numbers so I wasn 't doing rapid-fire costume changes in the wings of the stage and I actually had time to just hang out in the green room and watch the other performances </s> <s> However it did feel strange to be so idle when there was still so much backstage chaos going on </s> <s> The first half of the evening were song selections revolving around the theme of 'Family 'from Seven Brides for Seven Brothers The Sound of Music Gy <smiley> y Anne of Green Gables White Christmas and Cinderella and the second half were songs from The Fi 'ler on the Roof </s> <s> I have to get it out now I must say a <smiley> ecial thanks for the amazing men is chorus this year It is staggering to think that these men return year after year to help us out with the Broadway Gala given the amount of work they have to go through every year </s> <s> They definitely had a lot of work in store for them this year with the male chorus deman <smiley> in Seven Brides for Seven Brothers and Fi 'ler on the Roof </s> <s> You may wonder how a treble-centric choral program manages to find men but it is all through the connections of our choristers </s> <s> Fathers husban <smiley> brothers frien <smiley> random strangers <math> these men comprise our male chorus </s> <s> The only unfortunate thing this year was that Belle Canto and the Men is Chorus didn 't have any duet numbers since I only have fond memories of knocking on coconut bras of the men from last year is South Pacific </s> <s> I watched the first half of the concert from the Green Room t v </s> so it was hard for me to hear exactly everything that was going on but it seemed like everything a <smiley> eared to run smoothly </s> <s> The 'Goin ' Courtin isong from Seven Brides for Seven Brothers was extremely cute when 2 Belle Canto la <smiley> es were showing the proper courting ways for the socially unrefined brothers </s> <s> There was a point where each of the men took turns two-ste <smiley> ing with the gals and it was hilarious to watch their purposefully off-beat dance ste <smiley> as they to <smiley> ed the ladies around </s> <s> The numbers from Anne of Green Gables Cinderella and Gy <smiley> y were mainly small group or solo numbers and they all were carried off wonderfully from soloists from the choir </s> <s> I do have to say and I am not alone in this that the highlight of the first half was definitely the songs from the Sound of Music and <smiley> ecifically the lovely little Mia playing Gretel in 'So Long Farewell 'The unphased little Mia sat in the mi 'le of the stage all by herself and sang the solo line with confidence and charm </s> <s> I watched from the backstage t v is and my friend Nicole put it very well in saying that the performance was so gutwrenchingly cute that her ovaries felt it </s> <s> The second half with Fi 'ler on the Roof brought all the choirs on stage for the ma <smiley> numbers and I must admit I was winging it for a few of the pieces </s> <s> Due to the fact that I was in Montreal for most of the week and mi <smiley> ed out on 3 of the large rehearsals I was definitely lagging behind in choreography precision </s> <s> I knew my ste <smiley> for the solo Belle Canto numbers such as for 'Sister is 'an <smiley> 'The Dream 'from Fi 'ler but everything else was new to me </s> <s> I a <smiley> reciated the help of my fellow choristers tweaking my movements in Fi 'ler during the dre <smiley> rehearsal which was right before the performance and I just watched others for the cues in Sabbath Prayer Anatevka and Sunrise Sunset </s> <s> Also thanks to Amy from Belle Canto for gathering up some Belle is to run through 'Sister <smiley> 'with me backstage </s> <s> Sure it wasn 't my best Broadway Gala performance to date but I had fun and I know my slight misha <smiley> didn 't ruin the show </s> <s> The most challenging wa <smiley> 'The Dream 'and it wasn 't due to the fact that I didn 't know what I was doing movement-wise but lining up wor <smiley> with an improvised piano part was not easy </s> <s> E <smiley> ecially when we needed to get notes from piano </s> <s> However I am not here to dwell on the negative </s> <s> It was an extremely fun performance overall and I must give kudos to Steven who played Tevye for many of the Fi 'ler songs </s> <s> Maybe it just worked out that he is the husband of our choir conductor but we managed to maximize on his talent in the past few years </s> <s> He played the she-male Edna from Hair <smiley> ray last year and his comedic flaire for Tevye was <smiley> ot on this year </s> <s> Plus it makes me smile to think of how he is a

starting from scratch </s> <s> My first year or so was <smiley> ent focused on the basics developing the muscle memory of the right way to pull the squeegee acro <smiley> my screen developing a fluidity of movement in my personal printing proce <smiley> becoming familiar with the temperament of the inks and acrylic base how they change based on environmental circumstances how to coax them into doing what I want them to do with a little bit of airbrush cleaner </s> <s> My prints in this time were very traditional straightforward examples pretty much just ink on paper </s> <s> But

and galleries and the internet for more information on screenprinting but also generally about all types of printmaking </s> <s> So over the course of that year I learned for example about metallic powders and gla <smiley> bea <smiley> and me coflock and the use of adhesives </s> <s> I learned about very interesting techniques using wax and oil paint to a d d depth and dimension to my prints

developed a sense of the projects I should and shouldn 't be tackling </s> <s> My dad was an artist and I thought it would be a neat homage to his work to create a print of one of his paintings </s> <s> It was hard as hell to be honest </s> <s> Not only technically because perha <smiley> my skills with Photoshop and as a printmaker weren 't quite yet up to that level of reproduction but also

<smiley> ectations too much pre <smiley> ure </s> <s> I 've found that I work better and am much more satisfied when I 'm focused on my personal vision for my pieces with their genesis in my

simpler projects using more basic skills I 'd have a much broader deeper portfolio by now </s> <s> Instead I have a handful of finished editions that I love combined with drawers and portfolios full of pieces in various stages of completion waiting to be sanded waiting for an epiphany to recover from an e <smiley> erimental mi <smiley> tep pieces that I 'm just not sure how to finish </s> <s> I

paths a <smiley> roaches </s> <s> When I get stuck creatively in terms of what I am going to do next it is sometimes good to just be in the studio printing even if I 'm not working on my next

techniques or levels of detail that maybe maybe I shouldn 't be embracing quite yet </s> <s> And when things don 't work out exactly as I 'd planned I 'm e <smiley> ecially hard on myself </s> <s> So

freedom of being able to live life away from the watchful eyes of society and family back home can be exhilarating I thought Soma very ably introduces her readers to Glasgow a city many of us are not
