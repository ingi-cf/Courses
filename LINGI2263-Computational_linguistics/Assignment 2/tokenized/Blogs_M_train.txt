Long time no see Like always I was rewriting it from scratch a couple of times But nevertheless it 's still java and now it uses metropolis sampling to help that poor path tracing converge Btw I did MLT on yesterday evening after 2 beers ( it had to be Ballmer peak ) Altough the implementation is still very fresh it easily outperforms standard path tracing what is to be seen especially when difficult caustics are involved I ve implemented spectral rendering too it was very easy actually cause all computations on wavelengths are linear just like rgb But then I realised that even if it does feel more physically correct to do so whats the point 3d applications are operating in rgb color space and because I cant represent a rgb color as spectrum interchangeably I have to approximate it so as long as I 'm not running a physical simulation or something I don t see the benefits (p lease correct me if I 'm wrong ) thus I abandoned that 
Guest Demo Eric Iverson 's Itty Bitty Search February 16th 2010 by Daniel Tunkelang Respond I 'm back from vacation and still digging my way out of everything that 's piled up while I ve been offline While I catch up I thought I d share with you a demo that Eric Iverson was gracious enough to share with me It uses Yahoo BOSS to support an exploratory search experience on top of a general web search engine When you perform a query the application retrieves a set of related term candidates using Yahoo 's key terms API It then scores each term by dividing its occurrence count within the result set by its global occurrence count a relevance measure similar to one my former colleagues and I used at Endeca in enterprise contexts You can try out the demo yourself at http // www ittybittysearch com / While it has rough edges it produces nice results especially considering the simplicity of the approach Here 's an example of how I used the application to explore and learn something new I started with [\ information retrieval I noticed interactive information retrieval as a top term so I used it to refine Most of the refinement suggestions looked familiar to me but an unfamiliar name caught my attention Anton Leuski Following my curiosity I refined again Looking at the results I immediately saw that Leuski had done work on evaluating document clustering for interactive information retrieval Further exploration made it clear this is someone whose work I should get to know check out his home page I can t promise that you ll have as productive an experience as I did but I encourage you to try Eric 's demo It 's simple examples like these that remind me of the value of pursuing HCIR for the open web Speaking of which HCIR 2010 is in the works We ll flesh out the details over the next weeks and of course I ll share them here 
Who moved my Cheese The world has been developing in and out in all the areas and to create a difference in this competitive world we need to change change the way we take our things but we rather change or atleast try to change we try the same routine work evryday and expect to get more and when things fail such as losing a job loss in business we would upset discouraged frustrated and keep on hanging to the same thing again and start complaining CHANGE IS GOOD LETS WELCOME IT wondering wat is all about Cheese and what actually is all about Who Moved My Cheese Well Who moved my cheese is a simple parable that reveals profound thoughts It is an enlightening story of four characters who live in a maze and look for cheese to nourish them and make them happy The story is about two mice called SNIFF and SCURRY and two little men smaller in size and who were similar to us people Their names were HEM and HAW Cheese is a metaphor for what you want to have in life - whether it is a good job loving relationship money or a possession health or spiritual peace of mind And the maze is where you look for what you want - the organisation you work in or the family or community you live in Everyday both the mice and men spent time in the maze looking for their own special cheese The mice had only Rodent brains while the men used their brains filled with many beliefs The common thing between the rodents and these men is tat every morning they went in search for the cheese The maze had confusing network of paths corridors and some of the chambers had delicious cheese But there were also dark corners and blind alleys leading nowhere It was an easy place to get lost Those who found the way to secret chambers had to enjoy a better life After much of searching they found a chamber C which had an enormous amount of richest quality of Cheese Rodents used the trial and error method by racing through the corridors While the men used their brains and beliefs and experience HAVING CHEESE MADE THEM HAPPY Both these men and rodents enjoyed the cheese everyday almost many many days and finally one day was such tat the cheese had to run out and there isnt left anymore Rodents observed the minute details of cheese getting decreased day by day and they were ready for the situation and were ready for the hunt of new Cheese On the otherhand these men based on their beliefs wondered Who moved their Cheese Both HEM and HAW kept waiting for the cheese at the old place Fearing that they might get lost in the maze they didnt start to find their way to new cheese and started starving and waiting in the old place Both of them kept Hemming and Hawing for their old Cheese But couldnt find any and increased frustration in them It also created FEAR in them about what might happend if they get lost in finding new cheese They started evaluating the situation at Chamber C and waited there everyday and returned homes hungry THEY WERE AFRAID OF CHANGE Meanwhile Rodents found out their new way and found a chamber N having more cheese than the older one Everytime HAW wanted to go in search for the new Cheese HEM would stop him But one day in utter despair to find the new Cheese HAW started for his search leaving behind his friend HEM in the old chamber He wrote on a wall so tat his friend had something to think about IF YOU DONOT CHANGE YOU CAN BECOME EXTINCT and HAW in order to overcome his fear of getting lost in the maze he reminded himself as WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF YOU WEREN T AFRAID he continued his search and found a dark alley where he could smell some nice cheese he was afraid of what might be on the other end and started walking towards it AND when he moved he felt free and rather more young than he is WHEN YOU MOVE BEYOND YOUR FEAR YOU FEEL FREE but he didnt find any cheese it had some little pieces left over near the chamber someone had already visited the chamber and completed it He gulped some cheese leftover and kept some for his friend in his pocket and wondered if HEM was still in chamber C All the while throughtout his search he kept on noticing the changes in him and everytime he is feeling happy and on the way back to his friend HEM HAW had been thinking of himself as why he hadnt moved out before to find the new cheese THE QUICKER YOU LET GO OF OLD CHEESE THE SOONER YOU FIND NEW CHEESE IT IS SAFER TO SEARCH IN THE MAZE THAN REMAIN IN A CHEESELESS SITUATION OLD BELIEFS DONOT LEAD YOU TO NEW CHEESE HAW came back to his friend HEW and told his experience expecting him to turn out for searching but HEW didnt so he left him there and returned for his new treasure before coming he told him about the way he felt and shared the cheese wid him HAW started his journey back to the maze WHEN YOU SEE THAT YOU CAN FIND AND ENJOY NEW CHEESE YOU CHANGE COURSE NOTICING SMALL CHANGES EARLY HELPS YOU ADAPT TO BIGGER CHANGES THAT ARE TO COME finally haw saw a bigger chamber wid all the variety of cheese wid enormous quantity and was happy to find the rodents der enjoying the cheese but this time haw was ready for the change observing the minute changes so tat he could act fast As days passed one fine day he heard the footsteps and guessed it was HEW and was happy finally he started searching for the new cheese ( HAW could have gone to HEW and say about the new cheese at the chamber N but he didnt since one cannot infuse the seeds to overcome the fear and accept the change it should be from inself ) so evryone out der let us ANTICIPATE CHANGE ADAPT TO CHANGE QUICKLY ENJOY THE CHANGE BE READY TO CHANGE QUICKLY AGAIN AND AGAIN So who you are SCURRY SNIFFY HEM OR HAW Accepting changes like Scurry and Sniffy or else learning about the advantages of accepting changes or else hanging with the question who moved my cheese ALL THE BEST :) 
Yesterday I attended a biweekly meeting of an informal a UC Berkeley group devoted to Python in science (P y4Science ) organized by Fernando Perez The format ( in honor of my visit ) was a series of 4-minute lightning talks about various projects using Python in the scientific world ( at Berkeley and elsewhere ) followed by an hourlong Q A session This meant I didn t have to do a presentation and still got to interact with the audience for an hour -- my ideal format I was blown away by the wide variety of Python use for scientific work It looks like Python ( with extensions like numpy ) is becoming a standard tool for many sciences that need to process large amounts of data from neuroimaging to astronomy Here is a list of the topics presented ( though not in the order presented ) All these describing Python software I ve a ed names and affiliations insofar I managed to get them (T hanks to Jarrod Millman for providing me with a complete list ) Most projects are easily found by Googling for them so I have not included hyperlinks except in some cases where the slides emphasized them (S ee also the blog comments ) 
In the EU we have browser choice but few know about it The EU has been tougher on monopolies than the American antitrust authorities This has been good for Europe and bad for America In Europe we have an amazing choice of fixed line internet providers for example In the USA there is generally one DSL provider and one Cable provider per territory As a result we have more bandwidth for less money This is surprising because in general there is more choice at a better price for a lot of goods and services in the USA including cars banking and financial services gadgets etc But the problem with the USA is that sometimes lobbying is more influential than the common good In Europe our career public servants seem to be less immune to lobbying ( although not always and banking for example seems to be an exception and most countries protect their local banks ) But recently the EU has given us more choice in Europe This time is the freedom to choose our browser But as this survey shows most Europeans around three quarters of them are not aware of this choice It turns out that Spain is the country with the lowest browser choice awareness in Europe

Rush of imagination Raman Varman tried to cross a check-post that he crossed daily while going to his office But he was stopped by a security personnel who said Sir Indians are not supposed to enter through this way You may take the next turn instead What do you mean Indians can t enter This is India And it 's a silly check-post and not an international border You are wrong sir Do you see that statue there he said pointing to a far white statue that was crowned and had a torch in its right raised hand You are trying to enter America sir And you know that the law Whhhhaaattt oooo wow aaahhaaa Raman 's involuntary expressions rose from wonderment to more wonderment before the security-man knocked at the window glass of his car You are obstructing the traffic sir Raman woke up in the midnight He smiled switched on the light took his note book and drew a rough sketch of what he saw in the dream closed the note book switched off the light smiled again and slept Raman was a medical representative ( MR ) and had quit 3 firms earlier all on the same unique ground that MRs should be respected by the company coz they are most crucial in making a deal with docs n hospitals Al Toro Pharma was his current place of work He saw weird things in his dreams and painted the same ASAP before the prints of the imagination became too dull to be transferred to the canvas One day he dreamt the Qatub Minar just adjacent to Taj Mahal He was happy to bring entirely 2 rules separated by 300 years too close He had dreamt the water of Ganga going up the hills He had rented a hall every inch of which was full of deep non-sense that had originated in his mind in the past The paintings sell for handsome amount and Raman soon became a known image in the locality and quite unlike the SENSEX the radius of his popularity was on an increase He was uni-directionally paranoid the direction being that of his wife from where apart from the routine curses one day came a rotating a screwdriver that just missed Raman 's eyes Yet he loved her very much coz except few hours in the day she too loved him His position in Al Toro became o when he bought a Volkswagen- a machine that only earned envy for Raman They say that you can t but fall prey to the arrows of envy And Raman was no exception He decided to quit Al Toro and establish himself as a full-time painter a decision not in conformity with his wife 's opinion Being a full time painter of weirdness he would force himself to imagine insanities He begins to avert truth and the general perception of the things He would rotate his head and try to see the inverted objects only to confuse his mind as to what the reality is He would try to imagine ordinary objects ( like his Parker pen ) as an exotic piece of excellence He would find flaws in everything he saw and wish if they could be as per his imagination Surprises he began to believe is the most important thing that can keep you away from this general monotony of life Surprises he said is more powerful than happiness it keeps you alive His public behaviour has come (d eclined ) a long way - from humour to unwanted humour to objectionable humour to darkness and pity - a behaviour that created a mix of irritation and sympathy in those who confronted him One day he dreamt God speaking to him He painted it being careless about the result Is God weird was a question to be answered What Mr Raman want to say through his popular non-sense is that God is weird What Raman painted was a never-before imagination This made many sectarians ask Is this a Hindu God or Allah or Jesus or Bu ha or The point was if it was Allah then it was the sole responsibility of that community to object and likewise for others The defence from Raman was God is not weird It 's his talking to me that is weird As in many of my paintings it 's not the absolute objects that are weird rather it 's their actions are weird But the property of the mob is it doesn t listen to arguments if it has once made its mind ( if at all that exists anywhere ) The carnival of absurdities ( his Hall ) was reduced to carnival of ashes ( by fundamentalists ) as the last amber grew cold The outcome it was proved that God is not weird He protects himself through these agents who would commit all sins but not hear anything against something in front of which they rotate incense stick in the morning Raman did not go out for many days He kept imagining and drawing on his note-book and oscillating brushes on the canvasses His deliberate jumping into imagination became his habit and soon his very character It became hard for him to distinguish between a real event and a non-real He would meet many distant people without going out at all This was different from schizophrenia where you have a finite number of illusions playing around you It appeared some strange case of hyper-reality where the brain could deliberately detach itself from even the most known things Today he decided to go out of his house and meet his friends at Al Toro and see the Raman Hall Luckily he found the door of his house open for the first time since many days He rushed out Many men asked him to stop They chased him But he managed to escape God The world is getting ma er day by day he thought He changed his plan and went to see his hall first He asked a man nearby Sir there used to be a Raman Hall here Where is that Raman Hall There was no such tower here This had been a community centre since I saw it for the first time in 1981 He had misunderstood the building he thought He came out and inquired about the Hall but all in vain It getting dark he returned to his house He entered his house and surprisingly found that a thick layer of dust had taken the responsibility of protecting everything He took something from the floor and removed the dust from some parts Newspaper And it showed an edifice Wait I have seen this place Oh this is where I came out from in the morning This is my house He removed dust further and saw himself going into the edifice with some policemen He could not make out He cleared all dust The news read Raman gets relief Acquitted on ground of strange disorder Taken to Protege Asylum The body of the news was hardly legible He was tired He cleaned a part of the sofa and lay there before he found a dust laden portrait the garland of which were cocooned by spider webs on the wall He cleaned the portrait It was of Lalitha 's his wife 's ==================================================================== oh no kya bakwas hai ye yaar :( will write better nxt time ( mayank ) 
Emotionally Spastic Vivek was walking to go to office when he saw a spastic person walking to catch bus for his work Everyday he had been going same road to his job On his way there was a small uneven area and that spastic person would fumble and Vivek if there would help him through the patch That used to happen quite often you know it was the same spot but the spastic person would fumble anyway Vivek used to offer help but that person used to refuse Maya 's husband is little hot-headed He get angry over small things and there is a fight Fighting over small issues is common for Maya now and she is quite frustrated about her husband 's behavior what 's the difference we all have our weaknesses some physical some emotional In fact people feel so much pity or bad about handicap people that they are more than willing to help but I don t know why same people are screaming about person who are emotionally handicap Maya 's husband has a genetic tendency and I don t know how much we can really change our basic nature Is there a co-relation between these 2 stories Emotional weakness and physical one are they on the same level Maya can t change her husband 's nature but can she give him a helping hand There is one famous guy who said Accept people as they are I kind of liked it I would stop complaining why he is failing whether in a physical or mental quality you will feel like helping and that will solve lot of problems That spastic person or angry husband both are not ABLE to change but can we make other choice one that makes us happier 
Kunti 's Ghanti Before I start writing on this I would just like to tell everyone that am not making fun or abusing history its just seeing today 's IT / Corporate world this idea struck to me Whatever I write in this blog its all imaginary :) We all know how Karan was born OMG not Kyunki 's but Mahabharata 's Karan Ill just give a brief recap courtesy :\ Wikipedia Karna was born to his mother Kunti by his father the solar deity Surya Karna was born before his mother 's marriage to prince Pandu When Kunti was young the sage Durvasa visited her father 's palace She served the sage with utmost care for an entire year Pleased by her service and hospitality the sage foresaw her future difficulty after marriage of not having a child through Pandu and hence granted her a boon to overcome this difficulty By this boon she could call upon any god of her choice and beget a child Out of curiosity Kunti still being unmarried decided to test the power of the boon She invoked the mantra and called Surya Bounded by the power of the mantra Surya appeared before her and granted her a son who was as radiant and robust as Surya himself This baby was born with an armour (\ Kavacha ) and a pair of earrings (\ Kundala ) attached to him Though Kunti retained her virginity she was unwilling to face the world as an unwed mother She placed the baby Karna in a basket and set him afloat on the holy river Ganga in the hope that he would be taken in by another family Now lets move to my View Imagine people working in IT industry getting such boon or power Oh life would become so easy or i should say mantr ( a ) i :) i e if IT people have mantra called Kunti 's Ghanti then it would be so cool Guy working in IT industry is so happy to say my office timings are 8 to 5 so I get evenings Is it true Yes very much for few months atleast Then he has to be isolated Main aur mera Manager types His friends start shouting at him on not coming to any trips function get together etc His gf / wife is like tell me if you are going to come for dinner then only ill think of making something but think of it is it possible to inform at 6 30 in the evening that ill be home by 8 00 No its not Server might crash at 7 45 usually when cab is ready to pick you or at 7 40 your manager might ping you Hey did u get time to look into this If this continues how would people have family life Forget about life family atleast :P The other day I saw a kid in my society may be 5-6 year old kid his grandpa like came and took him for a ride I was surprised seeing grandpa taking a kid on a drive n all usually we see kid holding grandpa 's hand and going to nana-nani park or a walk but then I came to know that he was his dad and not grandpa Result of starting late family or loss of ( grey ) hair due to work n tension Let 's see the following story A 30 year guy get married and tells his wife see we will plan our honeymoon a month later so that I can impress my boss saying seeing the work I have postponed my honeymoon and will get 1 month leave What a plan Cool After 3 days of marriage he goes to office and mails his manager for leave for a month Week passes no reply then he sends a meeting request to the manager for the same Before manager could accept the meeting request manager calls this guy for some discussion He tells seeing your dedication we are offering you onsite opportunity to london for 3 months initially I understand you have just got married but this also leads to your promotion so thought of having a word with you Poor guy with a smile on his face and tears too goes back to his desk Then he goes home and tells this to his wife wife under impression that she would also go to london becomes happy ( which is not really going to happen ) Husband with all guts tells his wife see we can plan our honeymoon soemtime later as this is a good opportunity and I am thinking of taking it Next day wife comes up with this Kunti 's Ghanti and tells I have got this Kunti 's Ghanti mantra which would help me till the time you are back :) It works the same way it worked for Kunti but this is more advanced with protection :) If i skip the protection part of that mantra there are high chances that I get pregnant but am thinking of why not take Hrithik Roshan or Brad Pitt 's name in this Mantra instead of you Listening to this husband faints Story 3 Once a husband returns home after 3 days of work and hugs his wife and say 's I think we should start a family Wife say 's oh u had time to discuss this I already applied Kunti 's Ghanti a month back thinking you might not have time to even discuss this dont worry have taken your name and waiting for the result :) Saw how Kunti 's Ghanti useful for early family planning :P 
Gay rights pros and cons we all have been listening about gay rights these days Recently Delhi high court also agreed to make homosexual relationship as a legal act Prior to this historic and a bit controversial decision homosexual activities were considered as criminal under section 377 But now a man can marry a man and a woman can marry a woman Some people consider it right saying that we should not discriminate people based on their sexual habits If some one is homosexual that is his or her choice and we should respect it If we give their relationship a recognition in society then it will decrease the chances of unsafe sex That will help in reducing the cases of HIV positive A ing to that homosexual culture has gained a lot of popularity and it is not possible to keep suppressing them At the same time some people consider it is wrong They say it is not our culture It belongs to western countries and it suits them only Some feel that it violates their religion and they are ready to do anything to stop it from spreading Some politicians also have jumped into that thinking it may be another hot issue for vote bank But still i feel that though many people in our country have their opinion about this issue not too many really bother about it Specially those who are straight So I just hope it wouldn t entertain politicians much As far as religious feelings are concerned i will say that all the rules of all the religions were made by human beings only So we can change them according to the need of hour Now we have seen some people favour homosexuality while some oppose it I kind a have mix opinion about it Well if someone is not straight then I don t think he or she should be left out of the society it will only make things worse and yes at the end of the day its their life and they have right to decide which way they gonna live it Straight or Gay ( lesbian ) I guess most of the youngster like me will be thinking the same way and they really don t mind homosexuality being legal But but but There is something that can be really bothering I guess first time I heard about this gay thing from some of my friend i was in 10th or 11th standard and my first reaction was how can it be possible How can a boy love a boy or how can a girl fall with another girl I thought he was ki ing Only after some time i figured out he was right Well for most of us we heard about the homosexuality things a bit too late and by that time it was very difficult to think about loving same sex person Because most of us never thought that other way round also could have been possible and by the time we came to know we were already fond of other sex But the way it has gone and grown in India in last few years it is getting a bit dangerous Still thinking why well because next generation will be knowing these things from their childhood We will find the cases of homosexuality increasing and its legalisation will make it even worse Most of the people who are standing today for gay rights will not find it the same if their kids follow the unconventional sex ( homosexuality ) habits Most of the celebrities and young people stood in favour of gays But they will definitely not support some one of their family following the Idea Well currently we see in some of the colleges management is very strict with boys and girls hanging around together But what they gonna do about this whole gay ( lesbian ) thing forget about hanging around they will be in same hostel and may be sharing room as well I guess parents too will be having nightmares Stop the kid ( boy ) from going out with girls or boys So we have tough time ahead with this gay stuff Hope it goes fine 
Is uncle SAM behind TERRORISM - It is my debut in blogs and i was thinking to do it long time ago but cannot Now I have started it then I thought on what thing should I start To tell u when I was thinking about this in front of me the times of india home page was open and some clip of respected Manmohan Singhji and Mr Ahmad Raja Gilani was open in which they were talking to each other in NAM summit straightaway I thought that I will write on most important and dreadful and horrifying problem we are facing ( I guess more than Global Warming ) and that is TERRORISM It has been blamed that Pakistan or other countries in central Asia have initiated Terrorism but is that true I do not think so These countries are all the scapegoats then who is the master yes absolutely correct it is uncle SAM I am just not not crapping here I am telling u the truth Pakistani author Ahmad Rashid in his book states that in 1986 when Soviet Union was in war with western countries especially U S then the inititation of organised militancy was done In this book it has been stated that in 1986 U S 's Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) Britain 's M16 and Pakistan 's InterServices Agency ( ISI ) planned to launch mujahideen attacks in Soviet Union and most of the funding was sponsored by uncle SAM Now the question is that why are they afraid of aftermaths of the things they have done you have to be brave enough to face the things you have done Now the twin tower attacks triggered their adrenaline and they started attacking here and there creating more terrorists then stopping them There had been excessive killing in these in 8 years andits not acceptable and its just not only about stopping terrorism its also about playing the oil game and winning it too really hats off to uncle SAM and I am also still suspicious that was twin tower attack really act of Terrorism or it was game played by the clever mind of uncle SAM You never know because when they create moon on earth then it can also be done These things have to be thought about and or the solutions have to be sorted out otherwise towers were in their own country then it can happen to any other I am not blaming only one country but we should be ready for stopping it 
the pune visit It has been really killing me 6 months long semester is like marathon race and if you were taking mid sem exams on Saturdays and were kept on your toes on Sundays as well then you can understand what I went through It wouldn t be wrong if you say I was workaholic in last 7 months So I decided to take 8 to 10 days break And I decided to go for pune as I have always liked this place So let 's see what happened there I got ticket for a direct train from trichy to pune and I decided to board in that train in spite of the fact that I would reach there sharp 2 a m because that was the only train that has seats available When it reached some place called Sholapur in Karnataka or Maharashtra people started closing and bolting the doors and windows I asked what the matter was Someone told me that some people may come to rob the train with swords and guns He also told that last time he traveled through this train and robbers came and robbed the train (W hat the hell That is why I got the tickets for this train There were 4 or 5 constables also in the train with guns to protect us ) But I think it was my luck so nothing happened I spent most of my journey reading my novel or watching out of the window ( No hot chicks to check out :() I was praying my train to be late as I was going to my sister 's home in pune and she and my jiju were to come after 12 in the noon But they left keys for me with their neighbors But I couldn t have gone someone 's home at 3 a m in the morning to ask for the key My train reached on time So I thought I should rather wait on station There is one nice restaurant on station ( I don t remember the name as usual ) It is 24 *7 restaurant and its kind a place where you would love to go and have something I have never seen such restaurant on any other station I went there to have something and pass my time Su enly when I was on counter I got a call from my friend He is studying in Lonavala Dude 2 a m in the morning and he is calling he must be here somewhere I thought I picked and he was seating behind me We had a long chat some food and coffee I was meeting him after 3 5 years I guess the World is really small He had his train at 4 30 So we chatted for 2 5 hrs I left at 6 a m and reached home around 7 after struggling with auto walas One day I spent sleeping and rest 3 were spend in seeing the beauty of pune Now you must be wondering what is so beautiful in pune Yup there are no tourist spots like in some other places But city is full of youths and things that attract youths :) I played a lot with piyush ( my nephew ) Last time I saw him he was not even 1 year old This summer he will turn 3 Kids and food are hard to resist My taste buds were happy after long time So I played a lot with him and also ate a lot We sindhi are known for our passion for food and clothes I haven t seen anyone else spending as much money on food and clothes as we do And our food can t be finished without dessert So I was loaded with a lot of stuff I also went to my cousin He is currently working in CRL (p art of tata group ) in pune That is a lab where World 's 4th and Asia 's no 1 supercomputer is kept He told me a lot about his work and supercomputer Though I couldn t go to his lab as visitors were allowed on Saturdays only and I was heading for kalyan (1 hr form Bombay ) before that We went for movie ( avatar ) one evening We thought as it is a week day we will get tickets But we couldn t get for evening as well as night show We went for next day morning show (8 30 a m ) Well pune girls were quite fashionable and I didn t miss any opportunity to check them out 2 years back when I went to pune their shorts used to be below knees but in these 2 years they have come above knees I don t know where they will be in next few years ( lol :D :) ) Pune was chilly in morning and nights But still when we went for the morning 8 30 show girls came wearing shorts and sleeveless I realized that its quite tough to be a girl in a city like pune :D These girls were no less than fire in a chilly morning Anyways we went for the movie I read a review of the movie somewhere before watching it and it said you have never seen anything like this before and yup these words were quite true I saw it in 3D and found it to be really awesome After spending 4 or 5 days I left for kalyan and spent couple of days there I booked the window seat in the train so i could enjoy the beauty of Lonavala and Khandala Both the places are beautiful but if you want to see its true colors you should go in rainy season I also had plan for Bombay but couldn t go In kalyan again most of my time went in talking to my cousin and wandering in shops and streets I and my cousin discussed a lot about our college lives and all the funny stuff Couple of years ago we two were youngest in our family until some offspring came and snatched our title :( Anyways we are still the rock star of our family I guess :) So we had good time All good things come to an end So was this trip :( But I had good time there and put on some wait too :( I hope mess food will bring me back to normal size 
Haven t posted here for months All sorts of reasons and simultaneously no reason at all It happens or it doesn t Many 's the time I ve started writing a post and it 's never come to fruition That 's just the way it goes There ve been all sorts of lovely and important cultural events since I last posted Maybe I ll get round to talking about them maybe I won t I 'm not long back this evening from a standard ( I 'm thinking of it as equivalent to Classic Coke ) Duckie in terms of both Readers Wifes being present and correct Amazing music played in just the right order some of it having gradually accreted danceable fabulousness over time ( MGMT 's Kids ) and a good dollop of old favourite loveliness Amy commented on there being a Back To School vibe and although my own work is constant through spring summer autumn and winter I can see where she 's coming from 
Bu ha one day was on deep thought about the worldly activities and theways of instilling goodness in human The following is the text of conversation between him and his disciple One of his disciples approached him and said humbly Oh my teacher While you are so much concerned about the world and others why don t you look into the welfare and needs of your own disciples also Bu ha :\ OK Tell me how I can help you Disciple :\ Master My attire is worn out and is beyond the decency to wearthe same Can I get a new one please Bu ha found the robe indeed was in a bad condition which needed replacement He asked the store keeper to give the disciple a new robe towear on The disciple thanked Bu ha and retired to his room Though he met his disciple 's requirement Bu ha was not all that contended on hisdecision He realized he missed out some point A while after he realized what he should have asked the disciple He went to his disciple 's place and asked him Is your new attirecomfortable Do you need anything more Disciple :\ Thank you my Master The attire is indeed very comfortable I need nothing more Bu ha :\ Having got the new one what did you do with your old attire Disciple :\ I am using it as my bed spread Bu ha Then hope you have disposed off your old bed spread Disciple No no master I am using my old bedspread as my window curtain Bu ha What about your old Curtain Disciple Being used to handle hot utensils in the kitchen Bu ha :\ Oh I see Can you tell me what did they do with the old cloth they used in Kitchen Disciple :\ They are being used to wash the floor Bu ha Then what about the old rug being used to wash the floor Disciple Master since they were torn off so much we could not find any better use but to use as a twig in the oil lamp which is right now lit inyour study room BU HA SMILED IN CONTENTMENT AND LEFT FOR HIS ROOM We all are blessed to have a living example in our life in physical form Jaigurudev 
Seems my sRGB conversion was causing that fireflies from previous images Btw I was wondering why the farthest I ve ever get in ray tracing ( excluding fixed path MLT in C ++) was when I was using OCaml Say what You want but that functional language thing fitted ray tracing very well Also but that 's maybe caused by my nature - now when I have dozens of ways to implement something I start to wonder what way to choose what would lead to better design Too many options confuse me and slow me down big time

In both of the shows the main character is portrayed as an ordinary person who is so much passionate about playing football They at the beginning do not have that much skill in playing football but the unending passion which they have in their hearts make them play with so much talent that people think it its an inborn talent in them I too am a normal person Well a little big for my age not having that much stamina or any sorta skill in football So its no great thing that I was but a defender when we played for fun at school Seeing those 2 shows for some reason made me grow really passionate about that gr8 game It made me think that I too want to be a player have fun on the field hit goals and what not How I want to play in the International Field with the players like Ballack Ronaldo Ronaldinho Robben and so many others Well If not with them at least against them :) How I wish I could score against great goalies like lehmann and Buffon 
EU Commissioner alive on video Do you like me sometimes feel that the EU is a faceless colossus with innumerable bureaucrats that you have no idea what they are up to Well some commissioners have now understood the power of online video Just check out this weekly video from the EU Commissioner Viviane Reding I want all Europeans to be able to switch their phone operator â whether mobile or fixed â within one single day A worthy cause indeed Here you see a very human EU Commissioner and you feel her enthusiasm and drive for the issue she is presenting The video is simple but professionally done she is reading well from a teleprompter What a difference compared to just reading her press release Why are not more leaders using online video like this So I think this way of communication is exemplary but there are someÂ things that can be improved The video player should have an indication on how long the video is This is essential I want to know if I have the time or not available The video player should have an embed-button so that it is easy to embed the video in blogs and other web sites This creates viral spreading The text of her speech is downloadable as a PDF with a link next to the video It would have been better to be able to read the text beside the video Ideally the text should be navigable so that you can click on it to make the video jump to that part like New York Times is doing There should be an RSS feed so that I can subscribe to these videos in my RSS reader It would have been nice to enable some form of viewer interaction For example have a poll about the issue mentioned or allow comments to the video What do you think Please comment Update April 3 I just received an email from an assistant to Ms Reding thanking me for my email where I praised her for using video like this I had not expected any reply except maybe a short standard email response So I was surprised to see that the email contained this image of a scanned letter 
DELIVERABLES VS DELIVERY Wireframes flow diagrams personas card sorts content strategy documents etc All of these things are important to design and designers need some combination of them to synthesize their user research and communicate what they re doing with the other members of the team But too often these deliverables are the last line of contact for designers Too often these deliverables are what designers prepare and then hand off to implementors Then they shuffle off to create more deliverables and the cycle is repeated In the end deliverables are merely artifacts of the design process They are not the final design they are not the artifact of experience The end user never interacts with them they interact with the product or service that is actually delivered That 's the difference deliverables are divorced from delivery Thus the task of a UX designer in order to stay true to our calling doesn t stop at any deliverable Even if our job is to create wireframes we cannot be satisfied with passing off wireframes to other team members If we are truly concerned with the experience of the people who use our product / service we will infiltrate their world we will demand to know the quality of their experience Many UX designers are judged on the quality of their deliverables This is necessary to a point we must make sure each step is faithfully executed But to truly be a user experience designer we must have a longer scope We can t stop at deliverables We must extend through delivery Deliverables are diminishing in importance Sketches super important to early design synthesis have fleeting value They are valuable for a very short period of time Design implement iterate move on Record the learning but don t judge the sketch judge the resulting experience So if you re not involved in the day to day feedback loop of your user 's experience make sure you get involved Ask about your feedback channels support emails call-center requests twitter mentions all of it Do regular surveys and user testing Investigate Demand data If you don t you re just creating deliverables and missing the forest for the trees Experience in the end cannot be captured in a deliverable 
My youngest brother does not have much of a memory for directions and maps While this leads to some friendly jibes about his lack of that so-called 'm anly trait of the compass in the head so to speak it led to me to think about this whole notion of necessary skills So when I can look up directions on Google maps from my mobile phone or have an in-car GPS system give me directions turn by turn and even notify me of traffic conditions is a sense of physical direction an important skill any more I look back and realize that technology trends tend to define what skills are in or out I have forgotten the art of memorizing phone numbers because we know share contacts through bluetooth text messages and missed calls Come to think of it I have also lost the unique Indian skill of being able to buy a black ticket at a crowded cinema when the box office tells you that the tickets are sold out That 's because I buy my tickets and choose my seats online now A few years back I was part of a technical interview panel for my company grilling some poor people on the basics of C ++ and Java And since I do not enjoy making people squirm I left with a very bad taste I decided then that it made no sense to ask somebody the difference between overloading and overriding If I was asked a question like that at a job interview I would pull out a laptop connect to the internet and show the interviewer the answer that I pulled up from Google I fail to see why Indian IT services firms still continue to test people for their ability to memorize Kernighan and Ritchie 's memorable tome Memorization is a skill that 's most definitely out Information is freely available and searchable So let 's stop testing for information and start testing for knowledge 
A Billion IDIOTS - Before I went to see 3 Idiots I had heard a thousand people chant about the brilliance of the movie So amidst all the hosannahs and eulogies that i heard chanted about the film all the frenzied applause by everyone whenever the name of the movie was mentioned I went to see the film at last And did 3 Idiots live up to my expectations As a movie YES A perfectly made celluloid entertainer Every performance was exceptional for its sheer energy and versatality So As a cinematic adventure Hirani and Amir hold the story together perfectly But 3 IDIOTS for all its fine comic moments is a very dangerous film The movie legitamizes a scorn and hatred of education It ridicules the best education institutions set in INDIA sanctions wilful dumbing of our own It shows our higher education system as an arena of bad teachers determined to ruin the student 's lives suicidally pressurizing students Amazingly a film whose central message is the education system sucks we earn nothing at our centers of excellence dont study hard jusst do what pleases you is being hailed as the best film ever made in INDAIN CINEMA This huge popularity of the movie shows how eager we are to embrace mindlessness and how keen we are to see education and hard work as obstacles to enjoying a good life We keep chanting the mantra the-system-sucks who-cares-about-grades the-rat-race-is-foolish Yes our education system needs reforms things need to improve but in the pusuit of educational reforms we cannot allow standards of excellence be lowered The IIT 's must be applauded for the world-class minds they ve thrown up they are institutions that are respected all over the world There was a scene in the film in which Rancho mocks the Laplace Transforms ( the equation written on the blackcoard ) as an example of rote learning Yet without Laplace Transforms Hirani 's computer would not boot up As an Engineering student I have never come across a teacher like VIRUS nor have i ever felt the manic stress during the 3 years of my college life Let 's get real about higher education and not engage in an escapist fantasy and convince ourselves that education doesnot matter For each of us geniuses or not there are no short cuts So THREE IDIOTS IS A GREAT MOVIE BUT THAT S JUST IT IT S NO MORE THAN A STORY

There is a general belief that religion and spirituality are outside the scope of examination using scientific methods I beg to disagree Science comprises observation theory and verification All human experience is based on observation In ordinary life the result of observations over a long period of time is called experience However science requires the observations to be objective systematic accurate making conscious effort to reduce errors by repeating the experiments and having it reviewed by peers Similarly the difference scientific theory and others is that it constructs a theoretical model based on logic and mathematics This model has to be consistent with the observed facts The last stage is verification during which a prediction is made and a new experiment is done to verify whether this is correct For instance theory of relativity predicted that light rays would bend when they pass very near the Sun This was verified and found to be correct 
OM Shanti Shanti Shanti You must have gone through some unpleasant uncomfortable moments in life when you are not FEELING GOOD about things about situation or about people Whether its just about salt in food or somebody around you whom you don t want in the moment or you stuck in thick traffic or somebody behaving in a way which is disturbing you or sometime for no reason we don t feel good The most often what we do we blame others and complain about things or people about the way we feel And this happen to most of us and most of time without being even aware about it So what is the way out Here is what you can observe Whenever you are going through some unpleasant feeling Just give a pause to yourself and obsever what is happening inside How is the state of your mind Is it cluttered agitated heated up or heavy In principle this is what is reflecting out ( if you not ready to accept this truth say it most of the time ) So when you become aware of this disturbed state mind just remind your mind to be peaceful and calm right now If its too difficult give a bigger pause and just tell yourself that you are commited to inner peace you are peace :) and first become peaceful inside You will see immediately things will be more clearer This I observe after reading Guruji 's one knowledge sheet where He says Forget about knowledge God service any good thing in life first comes the PEACE If there is no peace nothing can happen And to my experience this is so true and striking peace at first place make a tremendous difference Its so amazing So next time you feel any unpleasant moods or moments give yourself a pause and remind yourself about inner peace and chant inside Om Shanti Shanti Shanti ( Om Peace Peace Peace ) And Share your experiences All Glory to Gurude

Now at this point we need to clarify the fact that three bowls containing the porridge were all made of difference materials each with different thermal properties This explains why when tasting Da y bear 's big bowl of porridge discovered it was much too hot mummy bear 's medium sized bowl was freezing cold and baby bear 's small bowl was at an acceptable temperature One can only assume that mummy bear 's taste in cold porridge is not completely bonkers Anyway chavpig that she was goldilocks ate up all of baby bear 's porridge This is described as a somewhat gluttenous act even though we are initially told that baby bear 's bowl is incredibly small He 's probably still being weaned off salmon Like any good greedyguts Goldilocks decided that she might as well sit down and spotting the bear 's three chairs decided to try them one by one Now Goldilocks is obviously a right fussy bitch and da y bear 's chair was considered to be too hard and mummy bear 's chair was too soft and lumpy like a bean bag or something Can you imagine taking her to DFS for a new three piece suite She d be a bloody nightmare 
But these are not very comprehensive and have to be supplemented by rules each society consider necessary These are the rules of morality and rules of law Whereas the internal rules need no implementing agency the external ones need agency to implement them Early on the group leader was the authority for this purpose During the course of time the village elders village panchayts the chieftain of a county the king the Emperor and the Government became the implementing authorities Any one familiar with law enforcement will know that 99 % of people have to be obedient to law under internal compulsion not under external threat of detection and punishment This is usually achieved by indoctrination from childhood onwards during the course of education or otherwise Here comes the role of religion Every religion is a moral code Observance of the moral code is essential for the faithful to attain whatever may be their spiritual objective The very high percentage of faithful among humans is I think based on an internal programme built into our genes No religion will stand the test of rationality One needs a very high ability to suspend disbelief to be faithful My theory there is an inbuilt gene which ensures this for the majority of people There are many other essential roles that religion plays It relieves our fear of death and life after death it gives hope for the hopeless it makes it possible for one feel bliss due to religious fervor which like other human moods ( happiness sorrow grief pain anger hatred etc ) needs an outlet It satisfies the need for performing rituals which seem to have a psychological impact on humans I am not aware of any society which does not resort to rituals 
Will it be used for digital video content ie TV Why would we want it to be used for TV The internet has the opportunity to continue to be transformative There are applications out there that can change the quality of our lives Im not talking about the ability to update your facebook or check out what where everyone is at on 4Square and twitpic what is happening to your friends and followers Social Media is one more amazing communication platform that is impacting our lives But its not tranformative There will be transformative applications that need all the bandwidth they can get Medical Transportation Defense Gaming Simulations and who knows what As computers become more powerful we need to be able to send more data to the cloud where they can crunch data and return it to us That is the value of an open internet The things we cant imagine today The applications that are just dreams because they dont have enough horsepower and bandwidth to work today I want the internet to be a platform for amazing Not Gilligan 's Island reruns I recognize that with openness comes the risk of the least common denominator dominating Porn has just as much right to dominate the net as any other app But should it Yes it should The lesson of TV over the internet vs TV over digital cable or satellite isnt about openness Its about the value of Application Specific Networks DIgital CAble is an application specific network Its only job is to serve up content and it works very well The FCC needs to recognize this and start working with internet broadband providers to define tunnels Private Virtual Networks or just plain reserved bandwidth that are saved for future applications When a transformative application presents itself there should be an opportunity to define the network to optimize that application 
The convention overall went really well Every year it just seems to get bigger I ve been to a lot of gaming conventions in the Houston area and Owlcon remains the one to go to A lot of those conventions come and go but Owlcon has always remained rock steady I can t wait until next year This year was a bit special to top it off Since I won the logo contest I got to see my design on hundreds of gamers I can t really say I was wild about the purple but hey it was my design on hundreds of gamers It was a very cool feeling To make it all the more better GURPS game I ran went really well and I even got to catch up with an old Army bu y I used to work and game with Back when I still wore Army greens to work instead of pajamas Matt and I used to hobble along company PT runs together at Fort Campbell We went to AIT together and somehow managed to get the same duty station together for our first ( and last ) assignment Both of us not being strong runners on our PT tests we ended up doing mandatory PT 
Notes from Mussoorie - Day 1 - It 's a clear night full of stars in Mussoorie The chilly breeze makes me shiver under my spine and somehow i am enjoying it till the core Looking down is Dehra valley lit up like a golden jewel What an amazing tapestry Amazing view captured by my retina The room that i have taken is a reminder of ancient British Era It 's a heritage hotel and well kept one During morning the Sun wakes you up as you open the window Balbir Singh my room attendent reminds me of British officers who had a personal attendant saying Haaji Sir on every possible statement of mine I am enjoying my stay Thank you Mussoorie for being so kind After initial hiccups i reached Mussoorie today Morning with completely no idea what is in store for me This is the least planned trip for me It was 11 by the time i reached and then after getting refreshed i opt for some walking aroound the Mall Road just to get the feeling in I came back after an hour with the notebook and started to settle Since there was no planned activity i was enjoying my state of doing nothing After finishing late lunch generally i got the feeling as to how would it be if at all i would be able to meet Mr Ruskin Bond after all he lives here only What if i could just sneak into his home and have a small conversation Embroiled in these thoughts only i ventured to move out in search for the book shop It took me only 15 mins to reach and i bought two books The room on the roof Vagrants in the Valley his very first book and Notes from a small room his latest I asked casually whether he visit here sometime and much to my surprize the owner said that he will be coming here anytime soon This was least expected Though i had updated my status in FB Meeting with Mr Bond but i had never even imagined it would come true There were very few people and all were waiting for him After sometime he came in his chauffer driven car There was no Tamasha no security guards no protocols He was walking and talking like any of us do Such is his simplicity I was completely taken aback He signed on both of the books and i chatted for a while shared a joke and more sitting just next to him I came back to my hotel room After sometime i realised that one of my wish has just been fullfilled It 's been so kind of him to take his time out I wish i could meet more people like him Mussoorie has really been kind to me Thank you Mussoorie Written on 13th Feb just before finishing the wonderful day 
As a former schoolteacher I know just how broken education is and how far away it is from hitting the mark of supporting the development and exploring personal potential for young people One thing you can do for the next generation of young people is share what you know on the internet If you lay down the breadcrumbs as you live and you share what you know it will live on and help others stand on your shoulders and build past what you have done There are lots of benefits to going to school but it doesn t have a monopoly on knowledge or hold the only keys to a great job I see sharing as the future of business too By sharing our designs with the MakeBot community we ve found a fantastic community of passionate people who are willing to tell us what we re doing right and support us in figuring out how to improve The examples go on and on What are you sharing What frontiers do you see for sharing Are there things that you re not sharing that you could 
I spent a bad night A night in pain due to spasms that kept hurting my spine and back the entire night After trying out various different positions to ease the discomfort and failing I sat up and screamed 's hut up And having done that resumed my attempt at slumber I had the soundest sleep for the following two hours before the alarm went off to wake me for the morning gym routine This is unusual Not the screaming the alarm waking me up Normally my apprehension of whether it shall work keeps me half awake till the designated hour But it did not last night or well really this morning I sailed into the gymnasium with forced enthusiasm and despite the few o muscle catches that occurred by the end of my two hours there was a definite sense of improved condition The bounce came back the heat of the morning sun on the lawn was welcomed and the entire day has been spent in spasmless wonder I wore a new dress 
Sorry Charlie Until recently it was assumed that Charlie Crist Florida 's gay Governor would take an easy walk from Florida to the US Senate in next November 's election Until Charlie 's support started to crumble around him that is A Rasmussen poll from last week shows that Crist 's primary opponent Mark Rubio brought the race to a dead heat 43 % to 43 % In an effort to court the conservative wing of the Florida GOP Rubio is running hard to the right A hard right wing Senate candidate would be a much harder sell to the people of Florida than a popular Governor who enjoys an approval rating of 68 % of Democrats As if that is not enough Lincoln Diaz-Balart and Mario Diaz-Balart (p ictured ) brothers who serve in Congress have withdrawn their endorsement of Charlie and Rubio continues to press hard Florida 's GOP is conservative and Charlie pitted against Rubio could mean that the Governor could lose his primary election and be out of a job at the end of next year Crist had to make a choice between running for Governor or US Senator Perhaps it he picked the wrong one In the report Lincoln Diaz-Balart explained that Crist had left us the two brothers no alternative and he knows why Do tell Lincoln do tell By Michael Rogers permanent link Comments (4) Tuesday December 22 2009 Huck goes pro-gay Well he 's supporting a gay guy for public office Of course a few weeks after a guy you paroled slays four cops you ll do anything to change the narrative about yourself Andre Bauer gets Huckabee 's backing Lt Gov Andre Bauer is being backed by former Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee in the GOP race for governor Huckabee who served as governor of Arkansas before finishing second in S C Republican presidential primary in 2008 endorsed Bauer in a fundraising letter for the lieutenant governor and Huck-PAC Huckabee 's political action committee Andre Bauer is a champion we can believe in Huckabee wrote He has fought for the people of South Carolina since the day he was elected to the House of Representatives in 1996 As Lt Governor he has ruled against every single proposed tax increase saving the people of South Carolina 2 billion 
However there was something highly unfortunate about these missions they were waaay before my time I wasn t around to see it I did get to see the launch of something equally interesting though the New Horizons probe This wonderful probe launched on January 19th 2006 I watched the live feed from NASA 's website ( after watching the failed launch on the 11th ) It 's main mission is to study the outer solar system and Pluto but New Horizons will give us more pictures of Jupiter and the Jovian moons than Pluto By pictures I mean the works- not just that puny band of the spectrum which we call visible light - particle readings radio waves light orbital charts of the moons you name it New Horizons will then go on to study Pluto and its moon Charon Pluto which recently got demoted ( arguably a wise move ) from planet status After this New Horizons will go on to study the Kuiper belt a large belt of asteroids and plutoids or near-Pluto size objects It will leave the solar system in 2029 ( estimated ) However perhaps fittingly New Horizons will never catch up to the Voyager probes 
Relations - There are two types of relations One is Blood made relation and another is Time made relation Blood made relations are like father mother sister brother cousin grand parents and all ( family members ) This type of relation is constant one ( no change in love love forever ) you love your father means you love him from the day you were born till the day of your separation (d eath ) Time made relation are those which are dependent on time like friendship As time pass by the relations becomes stronger or weaker according to the separation (d istance between the two friends ) But there are some relations which grow stronger even if the distance between the two is high So it is necessary for the relation whose strength ( love for the person ) goes on increasing regardless of the separation just to end increasing the strength One wants to shift that relation in constant one to the loved one blood made relation letting the person to become a part of your family So the question is why to choose only husband and wife why can t it be brother and sister or brother in law and sister in law Don t you love your sister don t you want to see her happy Love is all about to wish to see the person you love happy And the answer is strength of that relation ( love for the person ) is so much increased that you don t just want to see her happy you ll do anything to see her happy you want to be with her always And among the given relations in family only husband and wife stays with each other As this kind of relation was time made relation I don t believe in love at first sight [:D Well now a days we should think for brother-brother relations also :P 
Last week the same 7-8 of us who used to meet daily in shcool days had to send a thread consisting of 300 mails just to decide when and where we all shall meet together after a gap of aroud about 4 months This week my friend and colleague Rajeswari spent endless hours communicating and organising over two days just to decide where when and HOW she and 4 of her friends (S athya Swetha Priya and Swathi who used to meet daily in college and even in weekends ) can meet this weekend See the HOW that is a new clause a ed first it was anytime anywehere then it was anywhere but in a particular time coz someone has n t returned from college and so on then it was at a particular time at a particular place coz people come from far away on a weekend so they dont have enough time to come to all the friends place etc Now it is how ya How everyone is available but all are busy how can we meet hey I have work next week our project release I have a client call next week so i ll be home at only 9 00 pm and i have work on Sunday too so more often people silently come home sleep for a day take rest and go back 
All in all the impression I got was of an incredible wealth of software written and maintained by dedicated volunteers all over the scientific community During the Q A session we touched upon the usual topics like Python 3 transition the GIL ( there was considerable interest in Antoine Pitrou 's newgil work which unfortunately I could not summarize adequately because I haven t studied it enough yet ) Unladen Swallow and the situation with distutils setuptools and the future distribute package ( for which I unfortunately had to defer to the distutil-sig ) The folks maintaining NumPy have thought about Python 3 a lot but haven t started planning the work Like many other projects faced with the Python 3 porting task they don t have enough people who actually know the code base well enough do embark upon such a project They do have a plan for arriving at PEP 3118 compliance within the next 6 months Since NumPy is at the root of the dependency graph for much of the software packages presented here getting NumPy ported to Python 3 is pretty important We briefly discussed a possible way to obtain NumPy support for Python 3 sooner and with less effort a smaller core of NumPy could be ported first which would give the NumPy maintainers a manageable task combined with the goal of selecting a smaller core which would give them the opportunity for a clean-up at the same time ( I presume this would mostly be a selection of subpackage to be ported not an API-by-API cleanup of APIs the latter would be a bad thing to do simultaneous with a big port ) 
Change Its been almost five months since i graduated and started work and here i am now at a standstill Life seems to be in a pause phase at the moment Its strange how you change from a teenager to a grown up in such a short period of time all cos of a simple fact that now i am on my own lol sounds strange doesnt it It was much clear back then as to what where how etc but now life seems slower than it ever was Theres this strong urge in me to be someone to do something and show the world but then again the fear and the insecurity within makes me feel even more vulnerable and weak Sometimes i find myself over excited and filled with positive energy and optimism and other times i am like comparing myself to the better ones and saying wow am i even getting there i guess the more i compare the more i pull myself down well thats when i am jealous but otherwise it kinda motivates me to do even better Sometimes i feel great about myself but many a times especially when i am with others i find myself comparing myself with them for every little things i guess its gotta do with the insecurities that has build up within me over a period of time may be the past lol Anyways i gotta work on it after all its the change within that can change the exterior circumstances isn t it Anyways as for now i have to do my laundry and i hate it Meanwhile you take care and happy surfing 
Artificial Flight and Other Myths ( a reasoned examination of A F by top birds ) Tuesday February 16th 2010 Artificial Flight and Other Myths a reasoned examination of A F by top birds Over the past sixty years our most impressive developments have undoubtedly been within the industry of automation and many of our fellow birds believe the next inevitable step will involve significant advancements in the field of Artificial Flight While residing currently in the realm of science fiction true powered artificial flying mechanisms may be a reality within fifty years Or so the futurists would have us believe Despite the current media buzz surrounding the prospect of A F a critical examination of even the most basic facts can dismiss the notion of true artificial flight as not much more than fantasy We can start with a loose definition of flight While no two bird scientists or philosophers can agree on the specifics there is still a common intuitive understanding of what true flight is powered feathered locomotion through the air through the use of flapping wings While other flight-like phenomena exist in nature ( via bats and insects ) no bird with even a reasonable education would consider these creatures true fliers as they lack one or more key elements And while some birds are unfortunately born handicapped (p enguins ostriches etc ) they still possess the ( albeit undeveloped ) gene for flight and it is indeed flight that defines the modern bird This is flight in the natural world the product of millions of years of evolution and not a phenomenon easily replicated Current A F is limited to unpowered gliding a technical marvel but nowhere near the sophistication of a bird Gliding simplifies our lives and no bird ( including myself ) would discourage advancing this field but it is a far cry from synthesizing the millions of cells within the wing alone to achieve Strong A F Strong A F as it is defined by researchers is any artificial flier that is capable of passing the Tern Test (d eveloped by A F pioneer Alan Tern ) which involves convincing an average bird that the artificial flier is in fact a flying bird Now we know the goal but what about the technical hurdles Our visions of the bird wing are becoming more accurate it 's true and soon we may have a full model of every muscle bone and sinew but even this is merely information There 's never been a realistic timetable of how long it would take to replicate even a portion of the wing whether through biology engineering or otherwise And even the most optimistic birds have yet to explain how we plan to accurately rebuild the delicate array of feathers that are essential to flight Do not misinterpret this pessimism as cynicism mind you as I do believe these studies are worthwhile as we will learn more about ourselves and what it means to be a bird Replicating bir om though is almost definitely out of our reach Even if we were capable of completely achieving the above how would we ever know if it was a true bird Where does flight really reside We may build a functioning flapping wing but what if the essence of flight is deeper hi en within the cells or elsewhere We would only succeed in making a hollow doll that only gives the appearance of flight If this is the end result is it a worthwhile investment of our time and resources There are religious birds who believe God made Bird in His own image and while I do not share in most of these beliefs I do think there 's something to be said about the motivation behind creating Strong A F Perhaps as we are the only creatures on Earth capable of flight we want to push forward past our current capabilities perhaps even augmenting our own flying capacities if independent A F is an impossibility This could be interpreted as noble but I would argue that there 's very little utility in replicating what nature has essentially perfected Why spend millions on an artificial flier when there are so many birds out of work Many weaker fliers have already lost their jobs to gliders is it wise to rush to make ourselves obsolete A F research may unlock some hi en mystery about ourselves and it may make the lives of some more comfortable but at best true Strong A F is a pipe dream and at worst a challenge to what it means to be a bird 
Playing with Xcode and AppleScript In case you noticed a post about PDFopener and were curious I ve been playing with Xcode the Mac OS X development environment And AppleScript I guess either could be useful if I ever build a robot with a Mac brain I wonder how hard it would be to use Xcode to develop for ATmega MCUs At any rate the reason for the PDFopener project was that I got sick of problems downloading USPS shipping labels so I dove in and fixed it set text item delimiters to LabelGenerationServlet 's et stripOther to first text item of fileName if stripOther is not equal to fileName then AppleScript is somewhat bizarre to me an outgrowth of HyperCard 's HyperTalk language ( anyone remember that ) sort of a pseudo-English programming language It 's a bit mind-boggling for a dude used to C and Perl I didn t spend any time really learning the language fundamentals but was able to slog my way to making a functional program chipping away at it little by little with a lot of searching on macscripter net Trying to do too much at once and it would all fall apart Like building a house of cards That 's not unlike my robotic coding experiences thus far actually at 8 00 AM 0 comments Labels mac os x Saturday January 30 2010 Unicorn-1 Arm Time to arm the robots No not for world takeover I 'm talking about robotic arms Digging through the stack of old robot stuff I ran across a photocopy of this ancient August 1980 series from Radio-Electronics The first article offers a neat simple design for a robotic arm that seems relatively easy to build with some basic tools and careful techniques Interesting excerpts are reproduced here for educational purposes The elbow-forearm actuator is comprised of a large motor and threaded rod that pulls a on the midpoint of the forearm The shoulder is actuated I think from a motor within the robot Details on the design dimensions etc are given below To save weight I suppose one could change the design to use aluminum tube instead of steel rod for the side rods They re available from home improvement stores hardware stores and online shops Some parts ( right ) need to be machined unless one comes up with a simpler way to fabricate them If so I think all that 's really needed is a drill press a way to ensure drilling a hole through the center of a rod a cutoff saw some hand tools and a tap or two An electronics article from the 80 's would be good for a chuckle But since motor and mechanical technology haven t changed all that much I submit that these 30 year old plans are still relevant for the modern robot builder 
Umami Nation Kombu Dashi Smackdown January 19th 2010 Uncategorized posted by Dave Arnold Kombu a variety of giant kelp (s eaweed ) is a cornerstone of Japanese cooking Kombu is particularly high in free glutamic acid the umami maker but its flavor is otherwise rather delicate so it is an excellent source of MSG By the way glutamic acid + sodium = MSG (Y ou ll get much more on MSG and umami in our upcoming post Umami Nation MSG the Superspice the Headache is in Your Head ) This post is about kombu broth Several types of Kombu are used in Japanese cooking For a discussion of kombu I refer you to this website or this book We used ma kombu which was harvested as many good things are in the cold waters off Hokkaido Japan 's northernmost main island Yuji Haraguchi of True World Foods a premier supplier of fish and Japanese products ( we buy our fish for ike-jime from them ) brought us the kombu Ma kombu High quality stuff from Hokkaido Brought to us by True World Foods Most traditional books will instruct you to place a piece of kombu in cold water and then heat that water until it just begins to bubble upon which you immediately remove the kombu But recent work in Japan has shown that optimal glutamate extraction is actually obtained by steeping kombu in 65 C water for about an hour Several years ago when we first heard about temperature regulating kombu stocks we told a group of Kaseiki chefs that they might want to use an immersion circulator They looked at us like we had three heads ( in fact we had only two ) Undaunted we vowed to thoroughly test kombu stocks in the circulator Two and a half years later we finally got around to it Setting up the tasting Setting Up the Test The tests we would make one broth traditionally and one like the Kaiseki do by attempting to regulate water temperature to 65 C on a typical stove After carefully reading the dashi sections of some our favorite books we settled on 10 grams of kombu per liter of liquid though intuitively this seemed low to us For a third test we would circulate the kombu in water at 65 C We could think of two possible reasons the circulated broth wouldn t be as good ( or better ) than other techniques 1 ) if the air churned in by circulation had a negative effect or 2 ) if the crappy heat control of the stovetop was actually a benefit i e if temperature fluctuation somehow made the stock better To control for the air problem we a ed a test of some kombu circulated in a vacuum bag It didn t take long for Nils and I to realize the bag was probably a good idea anyway because we would get some vacuum-infusion benefits Yuji from True World also suggested we try some cold infusion so we a ed a 10 gram / liter overnight infusion to our test a 10 gram / liter overnight vacuum infusion and a 20 gram / liter overnight vacuum infusion We never heated these infusions with the kombu in them As a final test Yuji suggested we heat the regular overnight infusion in the traditional way ( until bubbles start to form ) with the kombu in it We ended up with 8 different kombu broths and we tasted them blind What We Didn t Test We didn t test a temperature range We didn t do 60 versus 65 versus 70 C Next test We didn t test the level of free glutamate in the broth Most literature will tell you this number is important But we can t measure free glutamate here and we thought it much more important to judge the broths on taste alone We didn t test the interaction of the kombu broths with other umami-producing ingredients like bonito flakes ( katsuobushi ) or shitake mushrooms Bonito flakes have inosinic acid and shitakes have guanylate both of which act synergistically with the glutamic acid in kombu to create a lot more umami than kombu alone Often a kombu is re-used to make a secondary dashi after the primary broth is made Some of the extraction methods we used rendered the leftover kombu virtually tasteless which would make a secondary dashi impossible So we didn t test secondary dashis The Results Kombu Tasting Results We tested three different groups ( red blue and green ) and then pitted the winners of each group against each other to figure out which kombu dashi reigned supreme The red block tested methods of making kombu dashi at 65 C directly in a circulator in a vacuum bag in a circulator and by trying to maintain 65 C on a stovetop The blue block tested cold infusion techniques in a vacuum bag at 20 grams kombu per liter in a vacuum bag at 10 grams kombu per liter ( traditional amount ) and 10 grams of kombu in a liter of water without a bag The green group pitted traditional kombu dashi--10 grams per liter started cold and just brought to the bubble and strained versus cold infused then heated dashi also at 10g / liter without a vacuum bag Vacuum bagged 65 C circulated kombu stock reigned supreme The verdict was decisive Unanimous and unequivocal In the future we will test vacuum bagged 65 C kombu at 15 g / liter and at 20 g / liter because 20g / liter won the cold infusion category We should also try cold-vacuum-infused-then-heated broth We think it would win 
In the event some form of ubiquitous entertainment comes first takes over the net and saturates it how is the FCC going to solve the bandwidth traffic jam They wont ever be able to put the bandwidth genie back in the bottle Screaming at broadband providers to spend the money wont work any better than screaming to expand highways helps to alleviate rush hour traffic The FCC wants Internet 2 at universities to flourish and develop new things But where are they going to roll them out to if all of our bandwidth to the home is being used for some new form of 3D virtual fantasy sports I just dont think these things will just manage to take care of themselves The reality is that when we run into future internet application roadblocks our politicians will jump in the mix and attempt to 's olve the problems You know where that will get us We need to start the process now of putting some bandwidth to the home away for a rainy day Not only do we need to preserve bandwidth in the last mile but the FCC also needs to figure out a way to create a transparent market or exchange that allows competing applications a means of knowing how and when they will have access to bandwidth when not if it becomes constrained And if you really want to make things interesting the company that is doing the most work on realtime markets and competing for resources that i know of Google Deal with it today or struggle with it in the future 
Power of Sattva Unleashed in Mumbai 23 to 26 Dec 2009 witnessed 490 people experiencing the Part 2 course in the famous Yogi Sabhagraha Swaminarayan Hall in Dadar Sattva personified Rishi Vidhyadharji mesmerised all of us with his Satsang Aerobics Yoga at midnight (6 am for me is midnight he he ) his brilliant Sadhana sequence and his Q A sessions in the satsangs early morning ( if you have slept from 4 to 6 pm then 8 pm feels like early morning ) Rishiji would conduct the course from 6 am to 9 30 pm Inspite of such a busy schedule he offered 2 hour knowledge sessions on 2 days from 6 to 8 pm to YES + volunteers Some snippets ( NOT verbatim just jotting the essence from what I remember ) This should be your goal Becoming MUKT ( free ) from the 5 deepest strongest and oldest impressions Food Sleep Sex Fear and Laziness He a ed that once you have become free from these impressions then you will know what your real purpose in life is The humour and liveliness with which he explained this was exemplary Q How to avoid being conscious when amongst people A Rather than bothering about looking good focus on feeling good In looking good you lose your naturalness and peace When you feel good then you will NOT become a football of others opinions and will be more effective Q Should we be perfectionists A Rather than looking for perfection be with that which is perfect Q How to handle competition as it involves comparison with others A Competition is sugar coated greed and jealousy A person who is caught in competition is a victim of greed and jealousy He tries to do several things 100 % and gets stressed Its important to BE ( not necessarily DO ) 100 % in whatever you do Q I am confused about marriage How to decide whether to marry or not If one or more of the following five are of concern ( needs ) for a girl then she should marry Security Companionship Sex Progeny and learning surrender If one or more of the following four are of concern ( needs ) for a boy then he should marry Companionship Sex Progeny and learning surrender Q While on my way to meet Guruji the excitement I feel is it feverishness or longing A While on your way if you are relaxed then its longing else its feverishness And on meeting him if Guruji doesn t look at you and you don t mind it as you are happy that YOU saw HIM then it was longing and if you feel upset or disappointed that HE didn t look at YOU then it was feverishness Check out the photos in the adjoining slideshow Jai Gurudev 
Is Yemen A Safe Place To Visit-- Or Live The drive from Sanga in Mali 's Dogan country to Timbuktu is not for the faint of heart-- and not even possible without a solid 4 wheel drive off road vehicle When we did it a couple years ago we got lost in trackless wastes-- with an experienced guide-- and broke down several times But half way between driving over boulders in Dogan and the rutted track through the Sahara there 's a stretch of paved road around a town called Douentza There 's not much to the town at all but there 's a roadside cafe where truckers and travelers can stop for a plate of slop and a cold drink and a chance to stretch and possibly realign one 's spine Ahhh good old Douentza I decided to fast but Roland had some kind of spaghetti lunch that took an hour or so to prepare While waiting we met a Spanish architect his wife and two daughters going in the other direction We swapped road tips And as travelers do we also swapped travel stories They d been traveling the world 's forgotten places as long as I had I told them about Afghanistan and Ceylon They told us about Ethiopia and Yemen Yemen in fact was their greatest adventure It was before the daughters had been born and the two Spanish students had been kidnapped by Yemenite bandits It was strictly a business affair no brutality or violence or anything like that They were treated as guests and a month or so after being detained the ransom was paid and they were released with the story of a lifetime Saturday night for no particular reason I tweeted a NY Times story by Robert Worth on how the Yemeni a iction to qat ( khat )-- a very thirsty plant that is mildly narcotic-- is making the barely habitable country completely uninhabitable due to the depletion of the aquifers It 's a story of desolation and ruin and danger It still isn t a safe place for tourists to visit On the other hand it isn t a safe place for anyone including the Yemenis The first time I ever really thought much about Yemenis was when I was general manager of Sire Records Legendary music man Seymour Stein had signed an Israeli-Yemenite single Ofra Haza ( one of her songs is below ) and told me how big she was in Europe how much he loved her and hated her manager and asked me to try to break her in the U S We put out several albums and singles by Ofra and she had some success but while she may have been the Madonna for the Mi le East her music was more popular in gay dance clubs than on Top 40 radio I always thought it o though that when I visited Arab countries-- especially Morocco and Egypt-- people were wildly enthusiastic about her No one minded that she was Israeli let alone Jewish With album titles like Yemenite Songs Yemenite Love and Desert Love and with songs Im Nin Alu Galbi and Daw Da Hiya it would be hard for all but the most casual of listeners to not wonder about the relationship between Israel Jews and Yemen an ostensibly hostile backward fundamentalist Arab country-- the place in fact Osama bin-Laden 's family moved to Saudi Arabia from Saturday 's Wall Street Journal fills in some gaps about Yemen and Jews with a fascinating story Secret Mission Rescues Yemen 's Jews by Miriam Jordan She confirms the country 's backwardness and hostility and goes into the ongoing operation of how the Obama Administration is rescuing the few remaining Yemenite Jews and settling them suburban Rockland County New York in the hamlet of Monsey ( Monsey has around 15 000 people 112 synagogues and 45 yeshivas and less than half the people there speak English at home ) 
I was eventually directed to the Paediatric unit and took the long walk with a sense of dread and trepidation Most parents would feel this way on that walk but normally because they were worried about whatever accident had befallen their child I knew Mate was fine they just had to un-Humpty Dumpty him maybe that 's why the paranoia was so bad Maybe if I was doing the parent panic foxtrot pacing up and down waiting to find out what was wrong with him I wouldn t have even noticed it We sat down with the Triage Nurse and I answered another series of questions as she examined his head They were a little more probing this time dwelling more on previous visits particularly the bruising episode Mate had been 6 months old when I brought him in with some unexplained bruises on his arm He hadn t fallen or anything it just didn t make sense That was the start of 48 hours of testing monitoring and questioning The Ward Sister could barely hide her contempt for me and what she thought I had done That was until the second day when she herself left him bruised after a straight forward blood test Whilst she never actually apologised for her suspicions she did offer me a cup of tea for the first time They never did find the reason he was bruising so easily but it stopped after a few days and never repeated itself touch wood 
This Blog is dedicated to all the Software professionals who are working day in and day out to make sure that they succeed in Professional life Software Industry as is known to the outer world is far away from it Those who are employer or are employed know the exact truth whereas the rest can only guess During the future posts i will try my best to cover some of the aspects in form of my stories which are based on true rumors I will choose the name of the characters which may coincide with some of you Day 1 Would you be free this weekend Rihaan asked Suhani rather casually She replie dyes This was the green signal that Rihaan was waiting for quite sometime Rihaan and Suhani met in office for the first time and there was something that clicked between them They became close to each other in due course of time They started spending time with each other on weekends since during weekdays it wasn t possible owing to strict professional conditions Day 2 Ravi and his Manager Karthik went into a meeting room Ravi was told to move to Japan as an onshore coordinator for six months duration in the guise of learning opportunity Day 3 Mohan had a tough time convincing why he cannot relocate from Bangalore Bimal his Project Manager was self proclaimed ruthless bastard He sarcastically made derogatory statements about Mohan and even stated in one of the Team meetings that People should be flexible if they have to grow But the most ugly statement which made everyone unhappy was When one is asked for onsite assignments people jump on to it it 's only when asked to relocate within India is when Father 's have Heart Attack and Mothers have serious injuries Everyone in the room cursed Bimal Day 4 The drama started with Bears Sterns going bankrupt No sooner most of the US financial companies started to believe that they will be hit and that too severely Retrenchment plans were made in hurry and Pink slips started to arrive in hefty numbers Indian operations which were not on the radar for most of the time su enly came into existence One morning Lehman Brothers went Bankrupt Sudheer who was employed in the IT operations of LB at Mumbai was shattered He went to office early that day The day was Sept 16 2008 Day 5 Wasim gave his homely pleasures and moved to Bangalore in search of better professional life Apart from cultural shock he was amazed at the lack of Infrastructure in the so called IT city of India After spending a full fortnight he wasn t sure of the apartment which he wanted to live in He wasn t accustomed to the whooping 10 months advance as a security theory Moreover he didn t had that much of sum Not many people outside Karnataka knows that to take a rental accommodation in Bangalore the tenant has to pay a full 10 months advance as a security and the rent is high by any standards perhaps second higher after Mumbai

Kuruksastra few debates and a walk out Kuruksastra is over I can proudly say that this time i saw it For last three years its something i only heard from other people even though i attended its previous versions but its not more than an hour if you sum up the time All in all it was good to see whole college in such a pace with everyone satisfying their intellectual hunger through drama debate dance and many many other things It creates those rare moments when the year recognition is lost and all comes on same floor to compete something which almost impossible to judge It was Shankar Mahadevan who eclipsed everything in the last evening The impeccable voice the aura and the charm which gripped the whole college for about 2 hours and i could still feel his grip on this college by seeing status messages on gtalk orkut and facebook I choose sitting in Ctv rather going in and dancing and i really enjoyed one can imagine the atmosphere in stands As far as i can see it was simply Awesome The thing i felt is he did not sung those for which he is recognized and admired To make the mood instead of singing jhoom barabar he must have sung Koi kahe from DCH No song from Lakshya and no from his album Nine atleast he should have sing Noor E Khuda I felt satisfied twice one at Maa and other at Breathless Overall its quiet a time and the feeling of real Shankar Mahadevan standing in front and singing is good atleast for someone like me who never saw any showbiz personality ever else than myself :) Maximum time of these 3 days are passed in NMV auditorium watching Hindi Lits Pride of this college They win everywhere If somewhere they did not won means they did not took part its as simple as that The confidence in organizing committee was something i m sure every participant was scared of Vishnupal led the team like Eric Cantona would have led the Manchester United years ago attitude of the best player + captain could be seen in the confidence of each and every team mate If football commentrator Andy Gray would have been there He must have said Take a Bow son Take a Bow The hard work of organizers was visible in the quizzes they prepared Especially Antakshari i think it was solely made by Amitabh and it was Something I was wondering how confident participants were and virtually giving lessons to someone like me who never ever even dared to climb up to that stage Boys and girls from all the years and from many colleges Apart from all this few things which took my attention First is the debate The confidence of participants was extremely good i wonder how no one fainted or even a single one wavering But there was a certain lack of preparation i bet there was Everyone was talking about something they guess should be rather than some solid points There was a certain lack of reasoning and every one was busy showing there ability of argument useless argument Like in finals topic was about Reality shows Many came and blabbered lines of Dinkar and Nirala Jo bhara nahi hai bhaawon se and all those stuff which has nothing to do with Reality shows Leave alone reality show i dont think Nirala or Bachchan ever said anything even on Show business Instead you should have prepared why are reality shows so hit and why or why not they are affecting society as whole Anyhow if you want to quote someone tell us what Stephen Spielberg or Coppola or Prahlad Kakkar said on effect of stars on us Quote something relevant rather shouting bullshit I dont know exactly what India lost in creation of Pakistan but i can tell what India gained and thats the endless number of debates Its Pakistan everywhere even the partition of states is somewhere related to Pakistan One was saying if we want to fight Naxalites we must take guns from all the policemen and send them barehanded Upon asking to elaborate this he himself do not know what to say One took partition of State as his topic and end up speaking for 5 minutes on corruption no relevance at all If some one someday show the videotape to that guy i dont know will he speak again in his life At last i came to conclusion that there must be Pakistan 's hand in my bad performance in class because its the root cause of each and every problem in India 
time 5 5 months is a long time Even though I ve made a return here for a number of reasons none of them involving any kind of humor ( I can hear tht sigh of relief ) I ll keep this post short n Kaju-barfi-sweet I ll list some places where 5 months are very significant and some places / situations where 5 months are hardly noticed - Waiting for semester to end mid way into the very first lecture of the sem - A bored Govt official retiring in 5 months - A farmer - A 93 yr old woman waiting for her first Haj trip - A Merchant navy guy setting sail ( timez nt too hard on the wife she has her options ) - Small budget movie producer giving out his first cheque in the movie 's name - An engineer waiting for his company to call ( ouch ouch ) - A pregnant-again woman who had a miscarriage last time round in 5 months (s orry never said its gonna be roses n butterflies ) - A virgin set to marry in 5 months - Period between Friends seasons - Man serving time in jail with remorse - Animals in captivity - Waiting for that first joint as soon as Rehab ends And now where its insignificant / time flies by - Man serving time in jail without remorse - Guy West-bound under Student exchange program - Person working in his dream firm in his dream profile - Kid of a working couple growing up (D ual-income-One-kid they say ) - Animals in the wild - Me - Investors when stock markets are soaring Next up issues Keep the Faith 
THE REVENG OF THE GEEK - Well I am supposed to be Preparing my Market Research questionairre right now but as my mind is it keeps me away from anything important i try to do and brings me back to things like blogging n chatting So While I was preparing the survey questions I realized that all that is happening in this world right now is marketing and business Companies today rely more on the marketing and advertising than on the quality on their products They hire the best MBA people in the hope that they can lure more customers into buying their products And this is the reason more and more people today see more oppertunity in MBA Even in an Engineering course companies see the communication skill and marketing appeal of the candidate more than his technical capabilities That is if you do not have good communication skills you cannot expect to get placed in a company even if you have great tecchnical skills Even during our UFMR ( User Friendly Market Research ) class all we learn is how to fool people into buying a particulatar product And questionnaires and surveys are some amazzing analyzing tools which ask people HOW THEY CAN BE FOOLED INTO BUYING A PRODUCT A great example for this is DOVE SOAP which on the pretext of reducing the contact area of water and soap so as to reduce wastage of soap due to melting gave a curved shape to its soap reducing the overall volume of the soap in the process And it ws portrayed as a pathbreaking idea while all the company did was to reduce the volume and increase the price The best example for this though would be POLO - The Mint With A Hole Even the tagline shouts at peoples faces that it is again reducing its volume by cutting a hole in the tablet But by the sheer power of marketing the company was not only able to turn it into a grand success but it made the line - A MINT WITH A HOLE a USP for the product And to a cherry on top they released the cut holes as another product too So no offence to marketing people but i believe that marketing is just an art of fooling people and Market Research is the art of asking the people how best to fool them ( No offence to my UFMR sir too ) That is why I believe that in today the world needs more and more geeks who can develop the products he way they were supposed to be and sell them on the basis of their quality not on the basis of driving the consumer 's mind And when the time comes when the world is run by geeks it surely will be a better place to live in 
APPLE S IPAD FOR WHAT AUDIENCE After years of speculation Apple finally released a tablet computer yesterday called the iPad There was fanfare There was rejoicing There was also much criticism everything from it doesn t have a camera or USB port to it doesn t support Flash or HDMI out to it doesn t let you multi-task In 24 hours we have dozens of reasons why the iPad will fail in the marketplace But what if the iPad simply isn t for the people who are critiquing it What if the experience the Apple designers have in mind isn t the one the tech writers and bloggers have been dreaming about for a half-decade What if you early-adopter geek fanperson aren t actually the target audience Humans suffer from a subjective viewpoint We see the universe with us at the center of it It 's almost impossible to gauge anything outside of our own desires when we size up a new gadget such as the iPad we consider first and foremost What good is it TO ME User experience designers however cannot long suffer this fate We must design ( and hopefully critique other designs ) from a more objective viewpoint As our initial subjective viewpoint fades we might consider the iPad anew Judging from the videos and early reviews it makes many common activities very easy such as email watching videos and sharing photos So let 's ask Who out there what market is this attractive to The iPad is attractive to people for whom a laptop is overkill Many spouses parents siblings and children in our lives do not use computers in the same way we do They are likely the primary audience for this device the people who don t need single pixel precision but can get by on single finger precision They may use the iPad in the kitchen the living room the bedroom even the bathroom But they probably won t use it in the office As designers and critics we must get out of our own head Subjectivity our inability to see as others do can be a cruel master 
Hand Made - It 's been really very long since i have hand written a letter to anyone May be the times have changed too fast Even on festivals we just do away with SMS or a courtesy call I wonder how Archies business is going on Those were the days when Archies Card could come in a very special way as the punchline goes and makes you happy Alas that was taken by e-card and now just email or SMS I think we should once again start this tradition of hand written letters or at least Cards certain emotions are better expressed in original hand writing I had few of the greeting card with me which were given to me long time ago on various occasions and whenever i look at them i go back into the memory lane and believe me it 's a wonderful feeling altogether Holi - Festivals of colors Holi is associated mainly with colors but for me the association is more then that The festival reminds me of colors water balloons gujiya papdi + achaar Kanji Vade to name a few I remember my childhood time when we use to play Holi with great enthusiasm Neighbors use to visit us in groups and pour color on my parents fully knowing that they are already covered with enuf of it Sometime they use to color my face as well and i use to run away What i do not like is the smell of the colors it has a pungent smell which i somehow don t like So most of the time i use to wash my face just after the group was gone There use to be Pooja at home and then Lunch full of calories I use to love Aloo kachoris at that time It was great fun until sometime later when the whole perspective changed and the fun element went missing and hence i stopped celebrating Holi Festivities need to be revisited on a very high priority basis 
those 25 minutes of my life hi all This time i am writing my blog after a long time Its not that i was out of content Its just that i was little busy in a lot of stuffs But this time i am out here to tell you a story that every engineering student tells when moving out from college and being a part of corporate world That is campus placement So TCS was the 1st company to visit the campus as usual I wasn t willing to take chances so sat for the very 1st company Aptitude test was a cake walk 80 min 35 questions That too all logical and quant :) :) But people scared me so much about upper cut off that i decided to score around 70 percent to be safe from both upper and lower cut off One could have easily attempted all 35 questions and revised the paper for at least 5 to 10 min if wanted But there was no upper cut off this time When results came out all those who did more than 30 questions got through I did 26 25 were absolutely correct and 1 was pure fluke without even solving the question Next was the interview The thing for which i was most under prepared i guess I didn t even know about revenue goals and other details of tcs Some people were mugging those also in the morning before going for interview I preferred not to take any pressure and thought of going rather blank for the interview You can think of my preparation by the fact that i took printout of my resume 3 times each time after a ing or removing something in my technical skills and area of interests One more big confusion of being overqualified for the job was already out of my mind after aptitude Many people first advised me not to mention my all 3 projects in resume but i decided to put them on the 1st page itself Because i was very comfortable with them So i thought if my technical interview goes on these then i will be very comfortable Of all the interviews posted on net that i have ever read so far had been perfect may be people write it only when it goes perfect Even though mine wasn t a perfect one i still took some courage to write it So now i take you to those 20 to 25 min that i spent inside the interview room and let me know how will u rate it My resume and form was asked and after 3 to 4 min a lady came She called me in I went inside the room and closed the door behind me and sat down on chair comfortably ( good start didn t fumble i thought in my mind ) and yes i greeted them good morning before sitting There were 3 people 2 technical guys and one lady ( hr ) who wasn t attractive but i am used to of it being in an engineering college (T here is a proverb all good girls go to heaven and bad ones come to my school )( exceptions may be there though ) They asked my name I told Then came the first question Tell me about yourself I spoke only for 2 minutes A nice full toss i missed ( dam me why didn t i speak much I spoke for 5 to 6 minute when my room mate once asked me same question one day acting as interviewer ) They tried to ease me by asking how do i feel here About language problem and food problem they asked I had to somewhat lie for this question and said people here also speak hindi sometimes ( now how many times i have met someone speaking hindi in tamilnadu :)) i like the culture Food and language are also not a problem I also a ed here people are like this that blah blah I don t think i ever lied so beautifully ever before By seeing their faces on this answer i could tell they were not south Indians as they were not overwhelmed Then he picked my resume and turned to page 2 of it He asked Why haven t you written Java in your programming skills ( i wrote C C ++ and C NET ) I explained that i know it but i am not very comfortable with it So he asked 3 to 4 questions from java Out of them 1 i couldn t answer properly but he was satisfied so moved on to what i had written in my resume I answered every question very well except one He asked me what is the difference between c and c ++ I don t know what was going wrong with me Again another full toss and i missed I told only about how classes work and how structural programming works Didn t use words like data encapsulation inheritance etc Then they came to area of interest in that i had written game design He asked why have you written this I explained him that i like computer games a lot and so i thought why not to design one by myself So i got the chance to explain my project and what was the idea behind it and everything I told him that i got first prize in Microsoft for this project They asked a lot of questions on this project All of them i answered very well (s ome of them were very good exaggerated stories ) They were impressed Then he asked me what was the problem i faced in this project I told them that as it was a strategy game i had to make it very interesting and throw a lot of challenges for players to enjoy it Again they were impressed by my way of expressing But one silly question i couldn t answer My game was on bhopal gas tragedy So he asked what was the name of the gas released in that tragedy ( f ** k i was searching this on wikipedia one night before the interview but couldn t see because college wifi was very slow college wifi sucks i thought ) They saw other projects and asked some questions on them I answered very well i believe Finally they asked what was the thing i learned from these projects I told them while doing these projects i realized that if we do the analysis and designing part sensibly then we can save a lot of time and work I explained them how and this one was somewhat right also ( some times you can speak truth also in interview :P) So finally my technical interview was over Now the lady who was observing me from past 15 min spoke for second time ( first she asked in between weather i do these projects by myself or are they part of curriculum hobby projects of course :)) she asked a lot of questions about me being posted this part or that part of the country i said i will work anywhere I thought of saying i can work even outside India but then i thought it would be being over smart So i kept quite Then when everything was almost over she asked you are very soft spoken is it because of interview nervousness or you are normally like that I fell for this one and said I am normally like that Now she started some chin music and i couldn t have dozed those bouncers as i agreed that i am soft spoken She said i wouldn t be able to survive in the company and take work out of other people ( now the only thing i could have done was to hit those bouncers out of the park and that is what i did ) i explained her that how being soft spoken has helped me a lot in my life with some examples I told her that what all i have done and how i have been part of organizing body of some events and how i have managed to win some prizes on stage performances They asked some questions on whatever i said ( i actually made up for that tell me about yourself by telling everything about me in this ) She asked me if i faced any problem during organizing these events I made one nice fake problem and told how i managed to solve it ( good story in no time i was impressed by myself :P) They were also impressed thinking it to be true one So they were happy in the end I too was happy I boosted every candidate on my way to exit I never took the smile out of my face during the interview and was at high energy level :) So this is how my interview went After coming out i thought it could have gone much better and i believe it was 60 to 70 percentage of what I should have done But still if anyone gives his 60 to 70 percentage in an interview it would always be a decent shot Next day when after final selection i called home ( i didn t tell anyone in home before about placement etc until i got placed )) Everyone at home was happy for me My mom asked which one is the next company I told infosys then my mom said why did you sit for this company then You should have waited for infosys or waited until someone even better comes I couldn t stop myself from laughing :))

visit to school Having been invited ( to light the inaugural candle ) to the first alumni meet of my school ( where I lived from std VI to XII ) I eventually made up mind to visit my school (S t Basil 's School Basti ) Time has always been the biggest inventor of the things and it did so There wan t a wall that did not get metamorphed Right from the Principal 's room to the overlooked things such as toilets had changed-changed for the better A new building had been raised adjcent to the existing main building and it served as boys hostel The playground had faded rudiments of the cricket pitch ( that used to shine vibrantly in our age ) The grass did eat the pitch up thereby announcing that the new generation is no more a fanatic of Cricket and a good basketball courts speaks of the interest of this generation There stood a permanent open stage right at the spot where we used to make temporary ones at each festive occasions ( be it a youth festival sports day annual functions ) In our time we used be the labelled labours taking benches out to the grounds making stage by tying them together and bringing them back to the respective classrooms in the same order ]T he permanent stage is a good substitute but I feel it had killed something the joy of escaping from the class legally and doing an o job between those cranky gossips while sweating badly under the torrid sun I opened a classroom labelled Std VII-A ( that infact used to be Std-XII 6 and a half years ago ) and sat on the last but one bench of the mi le row-my bench for it still bore my name that I carved with my divider ( a geometry instrument )\ on its right up corner The handwriting is ofcourse bad when you try hard to represent yourself in the hard wood A look at the black board made me remember of the faces that had taught me assortedly about this world I could hear echoes of Mr James ( our English Teacher ) saying To be or not to be is the question while he quoted intricacies of Hamlet 's intellect Mr Jaychandran ( our teacher for Physics ) saying the euations of magnetic fields are similar to those of electric fields except for Mr Jose explaining the methodology of ion detection tests have been based on the solubility product Mr Sanjay while caressing his silky hairs find out the correlation for this distribution and verify and so on and so forth Later I met with many of those faces and I must admit that time did fail to change a few of them Mrs Inan ( our English Grammar teacher upto Class X ) had exactly the same number of wrinkles she had seven years ago Mr Davis ( our teacher for History upto Class X ) was dressed in a shirt of same taste he had seven years ago Who says you cannot travel back into the time Then the friends each of whom was already in some or the other flow of life ( as decided by the individual destinies ) with some antagoism disappeared while some mutual suspicion getting involuntarily introduced into the minds of the people who had seen each other after a long long break shall continue further

birth-day :) Had a great b day :) Got many surprises and many gifts :) Am utterly grateful to everyone who wished me today :) But a poem written by Arnav a dear friend of mine stands out :) My poem is about Si harth What a sad start to this ode Si harth is I 'm mad I 'm taking the wrong road I scratch my head and rack my brains as I look to start this complimenting but the right words just don t come out now Oh that 's the perfect starting Words are less to describe this man who downloads many a movie makes many a plan He 's devoted to AOL smart on the street enjoys blogging as well as many a tweet His ambitions are unknown but weaknesses are His success could be rare but knowledge spread far messages are sweet salty SJ 's are a pain So he does to irritate or for other 's gain Great is character soft at heart His friends are near but wide and far apart The smile might not look good at all But he 's worthy to be friends with and give a call On the day of birthday No 21 I d want him to enjoy have loads of fun No matter what he might do today No one forgets the Si harth Jain way love Si harth 
I checked the traffic ahead through the portion of the windshield of the auto which was not covered with Rajni stickers I was precariously holding on to the dozen plastic bags full of cheap clothing accessories I had bought from Ranganathan Street Shit The traffic is too heavy I hate Chennai for this As I completed the statement a truck moved close to the auto releasing sooty smoke into the cramped interior of the auto I strained hard to close my nose with my palm without losing hold on any of the bags Shall I hold some of them Sheela offered I handed over a couple of bags and checked her face in the rear view mirror of the auto Beads of perspiration were flowing down her forehead wetting the sandal in the center But unlike my weary face her countenance showed no signs of impatience or irritation Do you need to go home urgently Not really But this traffic and pollution is too much to bear She kept looking out of the window at the passing vehicles like a foreign tourist admiring the ethnic beauty of the place I looked at the auto driver 's face on the rear view mirror and noted that he too was thoroughly irritated with the traffic and felt some solace for having someone equally irritated with the circumstances I turned to see if Sheela was done with admiring the traffic and realized she would never stop I had met her in the T Nagar bus stop waiting for a Besant Nagar bus just like me After seeing the buses overly crowded she asked if we could share an auto ride How is your new job Well it is no longer new but it is good What about you Did you er Yeah I got a job I am a junior accountant at a financing firm Oh cool I felt guilty the other day when you said you missed your interview Hey you don t have to feel guilty I might not have gotten selected after all I don t regret anything at all It is rare to see someone who doesn t regret anything 
When I took a vacation last week around Europe a little bit there was one thing that really hit me hard How can I have bosses who wish more for my personal well being than whether I am of good use or not Why am I saying this Mr Boss 1 called to check if I was having a good time more than once during the last 10 days Second he gave me his car and also some good advice about why certain things happen certain ways ( more spice to those who know it ) and during the whole time never did we talk about work or the deliverables that were on my plate ( which I did manage to finish before leaving although not sure if he was aware of it ) And when my CEO actually sent me a message saying enjoy your vacation although I never really did a big bonanza with a project or anything before I actually took the vacation it tells a lot about motivation and leadership And I wonder how these guys can be who they are be great personal friends and still be the whipping task masters if they want to You guys at Result are simply too good to be true Looking forward to do more cool things as always :)

Snow started falling as I went to bed on Sunday night Although doubtful that it d lie I set the alarm on my new phone for extra early o clock I woke to an o light the bedroom walls gently bathed in soft yellow sodium streetlamp diffused by and reflected off a thick layer of white Pure white blanketing everything The other thing that was noticeable at first almost subliminally was the hush a muffling of the usual distant London traffic roar Transport for London was all blue Suspended and Severe delays but my route to work seemed just about doable So I piled on my heaviest sheepskin jacket gloves hat and boots and headed out 8am South London was as I ve never seen it before My street was near-deserted only a handful of sets of footprints breaking the ankle-depth white No cars or buses The sky was television static grey with a hint of yellow promising more snow Walking between half-submerged vehicles with no-one else around I got a flash of Cormac McCarthy 's The Road and fancied myself sole survivor of a frostbound nuclear winter Drama queen

holiday season hello guys this post is intended for mature audiences reader discretion advised ( its just a line i picked up watching videos at HULU com endlessly they have a lotta free vids some sitcoms nude clips completely legal very boring movies and so on and so forth that should tell you what i ve been doing ) people what happened to the world we wanted to live in no we thought we wanted to live in anyways i cant find one person who says life rocks and i 'm pretty sure this is not because of just the winter blues i mean i am so bored i am practically trying to find out the luminosity of the light bulb in my room so that i can maybe attribute my dull and lazy attitude to it or counting how many hair are stuck to my blanket ( i said reader discretion advised vide supra if you think that was grose watch out ) looking forward to that laundry basket to fill up so that i can have reason to go down and wash my clothes ( which is not gonna happen cuz i have many underwears and i dont do anything to make my clothes dirty ) also looking forward to get some more groceries ( which i did the last time i wrote ) and so on and so forth a part of the reason apart from my immense boredom why i am writing this is that i am sick of discussing problems to my friends who inescapably feel bad after i miserify them and want to do anything to make me feel better sick of discussing girlfriend issues cuz nobody has one and sick of finding reasons for it which leads to some spirited discussions but m sick of that too sick of planning ahead to go to a club and then cancelling because the cab company wont pick up the phone sick of sitting in front of my laptop all day looking for some good movie to download and waiting for it to download sick of the buffering time taken by watchthesimpsonsonline com which gives my laptop all sorts of adwares but i still go and visit it no hammer it till i find an episode that is working fine sick of eating raman noodle soup ( creamy chicken flavour ) for breakfast lunch and dinner with same old set of vegetables and same old flavour sick of the right arrow key on my laptop thats not working properly and feel free to a on if i was a drug a ict i d have attributed these symptoms to it but i know that thats not true so there is nothing wrong with me its the world thats goin insane and oh this is when i have another 2 weeks of holidays enough i 'm gonna get a life soon time to buy some booze i guess 
AVR Programming on Mac Huge thanks to Dennis Clark for guidance and setting me on this path in the first place Updated Feb 28 2010 for Mac OS X 10 5 Leopard and OS X 10 6 Snow Leopard Yes you can program your AVR-based Orangutan with your Mac I 'm using a Pololu Orangutan LV-168 to control Pokey the robot and programming it with the Pololu USB programmer Works great I recently updated the AVR toolchain / programming environment on my Intel-based MacBook running OS X 10 5 Leopard and so I ve updated this article Here 's the play by play Step 1 0 AVR Toolchain The toolchain software needed to program your AVR includes the following avr-binutils avr-gcc avr-libc avrdude simulavr I suggest obtaining the tools in the form of CrossPack for AVR from Objective Development It will support the new Orangutan library ( libpololu-avr ) and the new ATmega328P-based controllers The latest version of CrossPack AVR as of this writing is 2010-01-15 and includes avr-gcc 4 3 3 avr-libc 1 6 7 avrdude 5 8 and simulavr 0 9 It 's based on WinAVR 20100110 The old Mac OS X AVR is no longer available and MacPorts avr toolchain is a couple years out of date The CrossPack AVR suite comes as a disk image with a Mac package installer It 's a matter of opening the disk image then double-clicking the package and going through the prompts Tremendously simple way more so than MacPorts ever was Both avrdude and simulavr are also included Neato Incidentally if you see the following error ( compiling with the new Pololu library ) it is most likely because you re running a version of avr-gcc that is too old (4 0 2 in my case ): main o In function main main c :( text +0 xa ): undefined reference to serial_set_mode main c :( text +0 x16 ): undefined reference to serial_set_baud_rate main c :( text +0 x3c ): undefined reference to serial_send main c :( text +0 x44 ): undefined reference to delay_ms main o In function serial_get_next_line main c :( text +0 x50 ): undefined reference to serial_get_received_bytes The new versions included in CrossPack AVR will make the above errors go bye-bye Step 1 1 Configuring Your Environment CrossPack AVR installs in the directory / usr / local / CrossPack-AVR You ll want to set up some environment variables to make sure everything works properly when you compile the libpololu-avr libraries First edit your / profile and a / usr / local / CrossPack-AVR / bin to your PATH environment variable in front of / opt / local / bin or wherever your old avr-gcc was installed Like this export PATH =/ usr / local / CrossPack-AVR / bin / opt / local / bin / opt / local / sbin / usr / local / bin / usr / local / sbin PATH While we re at it let 's set up the MANPATH too export MANPATH =/ usr / local / CrossPack-AVR / man / usr / local / man / opt / local / man / sw / man / usr / share / man MANPATH And we ll want to set up the C include path export C_INCLUDE_PATH =/ usr / local / CrossPack-AVR / include C_INCLUDE_PATH We could try to set up the LIBRARY_PATH but the CrossPack AVR linker seems to ignore this environment variable Close your current shell and open a new shell window for these changes to take effect Step 1 2 Enable ATmega328P Support You can skip this step if you don t plan to program an ATmega328P MCU The version of avrdude that comes with CrossPack-AVR doesn t support the ATmega328P out of the box so you need to edit the config file and a a section defining it This link describes the process Edit / usr / local / CrossPack-AVR / etc / avrdude conf and a the text in this link at the end of the file Step 2 0 Pololu Software You ll need to download the Orangutan USB programmer drivers as well as the new library for Orangutan controllers ( libpololu-avr ) from Pololu 's website CP2102 drivers for Mac OS X ( Orangutan USB Programmer driver ) libpololu-avr the Pololu Orangutan Library The drivers come as a dmg disk image file Download the disk image and open it After the disk image mounts double-click the Pololu Installer icon and follow the directions from there You ll need to restart your computer when the installation is done If you are using a different programmer you ll have to follow the manufacturer 's instructions for getting it ready to use for downloading code The Pololu library comes as a ZIP archive After you download and unzip libpololu-avr into some convenient directory you ll need to edit its Makefile to specify where to install the includes and static libraries The section of the Makefile you re looking for talks about setting INCLUDE_POLOLU and LIB When you re done that section should look like this You can override this behavior by inserting a line below that manually sets INCLUDE_POLOLU and LIB to a directory of your choice For example you could uncomment these lines LIB = / usr / lib / avr / lib INCLUDE_POLOLU = / usr / lib / avr / include LIB = / usr / local / CrossPack-AVR / lib INCLUDE_POLOLU = / usr / local / CrossPack-AVR / include / pololu Optionally you can compile the Pololu library from scratch using the command make clean to wipe everything and then make to recompile using CrossPack AVR 's avr-gcc 4 3 3 Next install the libraries with the command sudo make install Enter your password when prompted The compilation succeed with no errors ( Note version 4 0 2 gave me numerous errors and warnings compiling these libraries as mentioned above ) Step 3 0 Configuring AVR Makefiles Let 's try compiling one of the Pololu examples that come with libpololu-avr Before we can do that we have to edit the Makefile You ll need to do this with any Makefile you create First we need to fix the linker 's search path As mentioned the linker ignores the LIBRARY_PATH environment variable so edit the Makefile to a the CrossPack AVR directory to the library search path Set ( or a to ) the LIBDIRS variable which is used to list -L switches which a the specified path to the linker 's search path LIBDIRS = -L / usr / local / CrossPack-AVR / lib To include the MCU-specific library you d use for example -lpololu_atmega168 ( or whatever MCU you have ) when linking objects together Set ( or a to ) the LIBS variable LIBS = -lpololu_ ( MCU ) Find ( or a ) the MCU assignment to specify the device ( atmega168 atmega328P etc ) MCU = atmega168 Instead if there 's a DEVICE specified make that atmega168 ( etc ) The example I looked at uses an AVRDUDE_DEVICE set to m168 Note that the CrossPack-AVR avrdude will recognize the device atmega168 so you can simplify your project makefiles by using a single variable ( like MCU ) for both the avr-gcc and avrdude command lines Now that you have all the preliminaries set up time to ensure that the linking command includes the LIBS and LIBDIRS variables A ( LIBDIRS ) and ( LIBS ) to your link command in the correct order LIBDIRS first LIBS second appearing after the list of objects like this Link (T ARGET ): ( OBJECTS ) ( CC ) ( LDFLAGS ) ( OBJECTS ) ( LINKONLYOBJECTS ) ( LIBDIRS ) ( LIBS ) -o (T ARGET ) The order of command line flags is really important You must first list your object file then list the library directory then list your library as above If you list the library first and the search path second you ll probably see an error like this / usr / local / CrossPack-AVR-20100115 / lib / gcc / avr /4 3 3 / / / / / avr / bin / ld cannot find -lpololu_atmega168 Make sure the avrdude command is correct ( we ll revisit this momentarily ) something like this avrdude -q -p ( MCU ) -P (S ERIAL ) -c avrispv2 -e -U flash w (P ROJECT ) hex or like this ( AVRDUDE ) -p ( AVRDUDE_DEVICE ) -c avrisp2 -P (P ORT ) -U flash w (T ARGET ) hex The variable SERIAL or PORT should be defined in the Makefile as / dev / tty Pololu Also be sure your Makefiles are using the correct avr-gcc Just specify avr-gcc as the compiler with no path CC = avr-gcc Then make sure that the CrossPack AVR version of avr-gcc is in your path via the command which avr-gcc and if not did you set up the path variable correctly from Step 1 1 Did you open a new shell window One other thing If you compile and link the static pololu library but you aren t using all the functions then you re a ing a lot of unnecessary code onto your AVR that is doing nothing but taking up space To tell the linker to prune out everything except what 's actually used a the option -Wl -gc-sections to your LDFLAGS like so LDFLAGS +=- Wl -gc-sections Here 's what I got when I did all of the above then compiled the libpololu-avr 's lcd1 test program pwd / Users / mes / Documents / Robot / src / libpololu-avr / examples / atmega168 / lcd1 ls Makefile lcd1 aps test c make avr-gcc -g -Wall -mcall-prologues -mmcu = atmega168 -Os -c -o test o test c avr-gcc -g -Wall -mcall-prologues -mmcu = atmega168 -Os test o -Wl -gc-sections -L / usr / local / CrossPack-AVR / lib -lpololu_atmega168 -Wl -relax -o test obj avr-objcopy -R eeprom -O ihex test obj test hex rm test obj Step 4 0 Programming the Orangutan AVR You re ready to download some code to your Orangutan Here 's Pololu 's user guide entry on using avrdude with their USB serial programmer ( on Windows ): http // www pololu com / docs /0 J6 view_all =1 5 d The correct command should already be set up in the Makefile for the Pololu library examples and the demo program You should be able to simply issue the command make program For what it 's worth the avrdude command should look something like this avrdude -p atmega168 -P / dev / tty Pololu -c avrispv2 -e -U flash w test hex The argument following the -p is the part number and should be atmega168 ( or m168 ) atmega48 ( m48 ) etc Note that this version of avrdude doesn t support the atmega328P out of the box see Step 1 2 after which you can specify atmega328p ( m328p ) as a part The argument following the -P is the serial port On Mac OS X do an ls of / dev / tty * and you will see the Pololu serial device driver of your Orangutan USB programmer ( it should be / dev / tty Pololu ) The programmer ID is specified using the -c option and should be avrispv2 The -e option results in a chip erase and the -U option is used for writing reading or verifying flash EEPROM fuses or lock bits In this example we are using -U to write test hex to flash Running make program with the programmer plugged in but without plugging it into the Orangutan or leaving the Orangutan off you will see flashy red / green lights as the software attempts to find the AVR then make program avrdude -q -p atmega168 -P / dev / tty Pololu -c avrispv2 -e -U flash w :s ervo hex avrdude stk500v2_command (): command failed avrdude stk500v2_command (): unknown status 0xc9 avrdude stk500v2_program_enable (): cannot get connection status avrdude initialization failed rc =-1 Double check connections and try again or use -F to override this check avrdude done Thank you make *** [p rogram Error 1 If you plug in and turn on the Orangutan the program should be written into the MCU 's flash memory Note that the avrdude command includes the -q option which suppresses the progress indicator hashmarks Use this switch when using Emacs make program avrdude -q -p atmega168 -P / dev / tty Pololu -c avrispv2 -e -U flash w :s ervo hex avrdude AVR device initialized and ready to accept instructions avrdude Device signature = 0x1e9406 avrdude erasing chip avrdude reading input file 's ervo hex avrdude input

code so you need an editor or IDE But which editor to choose Emacs I have been an Emacs geek for 20 years ( yikes I 'm old ) so needless to say it is my Integrated Development Environment ( IDE ) of choice But it is all text-based Yes it is an IDE you can make / compile code step through errors run software and do anything else you can think of (s ince it is programmable ) all within the editor It is fast and very lightweight ( thanks to Moore 's Law ) It 's old school but if you learn it well it 's quick to use ( hey kids you may not remember the days before menus and mouses but there are some things that are much faster using keyboard shortcuts ) Here 's a reference card with emacs key combinations http // www geek-girl com / emacs / refcard html Fortunately you ll find emacs on your Mac but working with many files at once is challenging Instead may I suggest you try my preference Aquamacs a try It 's Emacs with an Aqua interface It 's quite decent and it puts each file ( module header etc ) in a separate OS X window I found this tool really improved my productivity -- and protected my sanity Configuring Emacs is pretty simple To make it as useful as possible I set up the ability to compile programs within Emacs as well as stepping through compile errors by editing / creating the emacs preferences file to include the following key bindings ( global-set-key C-xc compile ) ( global-set-key C-xn next-error ) Xcode Another option is the Xcode editor David Beck 's Blog has some good information in setting up an Xcode project template with CrossPack-AVR Eclipse And still another option is to use Eclipse a fantastic popular open source java-based GUI IDE It 's a pretty big application takes a while to launch on slower systems but it is extremely flexible very nice to use and powerful They offer a version with C / C ++ plugins that you ll probably want to use for AVR One of the folks in a local Colorado robotics club Dennis Clark has configured Eclipse to handle both the coding and downloading / programming for AVR I have the plugins installed but would like to configure it to program the AVR at the press of a button as Dennis did Still working on this That 's All So there you are If you go through the above you should be good to go in programming your AVR whether an Orangutan like I 'm using or whatever else Happy AVR programming Big thanks to Mike Seeman 's guide on AVR software for Mac It 's a good guide and you should have a peek Since I needed to get my environment set up for the Orangutan anyway I wanted to document the experience and provide an updated simpler guide using MacPorts in case it helps someone out there someday 
Identity Theft Posted by Scott on Mar 15 2010 in Marketing Identity theft is something you always hear about that happens to other people Well it 's happening to you right now and or you are doing it to someone else I 'm talking about a different kind of identity theft Your businesses identity Who is trying to make their business look and act just like yours Or who are you trying to steal their identity Who are you and your business and what do you want to be I think many of us are in an identity crisis right now Are you taking daily actions that are in-line with your identity Never loose track of what you want to be Photographers in your area will try to copy impersonate or just learn from your creativity Now I have a lot of great local friends that are photographers and we respect each other But some people with cameras have no morals or boundaries The best advice I can give you is that that you should be flattered when people copy you Aww bull shit you should be pissed Pissed enough to step up your game and make it harder for them to copy you next time I don t need to sugar coat life 's lessons like your momma did make it light your fire Identity crisis is your business suffering from one Most photographers are Don t try and be everything to everyone Jack of all trades and master of none is very true all of the time We even struggle with identity problems and the new studio is helping us look closer at the future that we want for our business Boutique is a hot industry phrase but we are evolving into a newer version of an upscale portrait studio of the modern world What would have been considered an upscale studio 10yrs ago is not the same look and environment that it would have today Modern look is part of out identity and something that we will continue to push towards Art and products are really a part of the modern look Before I go to far into our struggles with identitiy I think you should take a snapshot of your business and really see what your identity is Not just a purdy picture of your entry look at all of your marketing clients bank account schedule etc Who are you and what is is the image that you business is really portraying And to top it all off what makes you different than your competition 76 votes Buzz up 2 Not to shabby Posted by Scott on Mar 14 2010 in Marketing I had that family session today (S unday ) for a good client I knew it would be worth it They bought 2 gallery wrap wall portraits and a framed one plus an ablum and 25 gift prints Cha-Ching not enough for college for the kids but at least enough to get them into a trade school I still hate working on Sundays but sometimes I need to put the business first I think I worked 3 Sundays this year but just for a couple of hours on each Ideally I would never do it but if I want to claim to have great customer service I need to go above and beyone for a few special people However Sundays have a large minimum deposit required You have to pay to play with me on my day off 76 votes Buzz up 2 Why am I pumped up Posted by Scott on Mar 13 2010 in Marketing With out sounding like Hans and Frans I am pumped up about the p90x Tonight will be day 4 and I actually can t wait to do it I 'm feeling good and I already did my 3mi run this morning most of the soreness is at least bearable today LOL I 'm glad it 's going good so far I wonder how any days most people complete in a program like this before quitting My guess is less than 10 days but probably closer to 5 Watch out for that first day missed that 's where it all starts to go to hell in a hand-basket You miss the first day and then two and then two turns to a week and bam you fell off the proverbial wagon How much like real life is that Something you want to do or need to do and you start doing it and then you just let it all slip away Feel free to call me out if you don t read about it for a day because I do plan on at least mentioning it on here I know some of you are starting it right along with us make sure you keep up posted Anyway day 4 is Yoga I think Maybe I should make a charity video of that performance NOT 
Ok let 's change our API in the places necessary to make the phone consistent with our other platforms But breaking changes are expensive Having gone three years without any major breaks we felt this was a good time to introduce an inflection point cleaning up our act and setting ourselves up for the future But we also felt it was important that this be a one time thing Breaking changes every three years may be ok but every year or every six months most certainly would not If we re going to break it let 's break it good taking all the pain in one go so we don t have to break again for many years to come So we took the opportunity provided by the phone to also reduce those nagging Windows vs Xbox inconsistencies We also used this opportunity to improve usability applying our three years of experience to look at which things cause the most confusion for our customers and tweaking these APIs to reduce the chance of error Finally we gazed deep into our crystal ball in an attempt to predict the future This failed miserably (s adly it turns out I am not psychic at all - ) so instead I made some guesses XNA Game Studio 4 0 sits on top of DirectX 9 on both Windows and Xbox 360 and we have no immediate plans to move to DirectX 10 or 11 but looking years into the future it seems at least possible we might someday want to do that DirectX 11 a 's some things that are not in DirectX 9 but it also changes and in some cases removes features A ing features is relatively painless from a compatibility perspective ( it 's easy to imagine how a third profile could someday sit alongside Reach and HiDef ) but taking things away hurts deep ( it would suck if any such third profile could not be a strict superset of HiDef in the same way that HiDef is a superset of Reach ) So we looked at what it would take to implement our API using DirectX 11 and made sure we didn t include anything that would make this excessively difficult I am not promising we will ever support DirectX 11 just saying we did some thinking about this and laid some groundwork so if we ever do want it we can go there without having to break backward compatibility 
Your lips dont move yet you talk through your mind telepathically You could even feel your heart beating with a sense of love The atmosphere now is calm and tranquil and ur minds or rather your hearts could communicate effectively which gives you a feeling that there is no one in this world to seperate you and a gentle look at the moon is to just show that your love is eternal and perpetual like the moon The feeling of complacency can also be sensed which indicates that you had thoroughly enjoyed every moment being spent and no longer need anything more in your life It looks as if the entire sky is there to protect you and to keep you closer and even more intimate A drop of tear would make it even more emotional and passionate indicating the intensity of your love A candle light dinner is meant to evoke the lost emotions in your hearts the fire that has lost in the labyrinth of daily routines and hectic work schedules 
When the world was explored many exotic creatures and cultures were found Many of them more tolerant and adaptable than those of the first explorers The men and women of these cultures were different in customs behaviour speech and appearance and hence became candidates for brutal discrimination Man against man perpetrated the most inhuman of all crimes Then arose a cry for equality from men and women courageous enough to stand up to their oppressors And then began a battle without This battle was of little consequence until men and women of all types could set aside their differences and accept their humanity as their first identity their equality as a matter of course Slowly the tides turned People became more tolerant And yet the battle was not won It is not won Often equality has been confused with bland conformity which resulted in socialist and marxist movements Noble were their ideals and yet as history has shown they were doomed to fall In hindsight this is obvious because every man and woman seeks to be different to stand out from the crowd to achieve a higher station in society to be appreciated 
When I think of the four months after that incident I feel they were the happiest times in the factory for us Paarthi became too silent though he never openly acknowledged what happened that day He still bossed around people but never came anywhere close to us I left Johnny at my house and asked father to feed him in the afternoon Every evening after work all six of us would walk to my house We would play with Johnny for about an hour and then the other kids would walk back home There were increasingly frequent occasions when the supervisor would leave the factory in the mi le of the day and not return for a long time We would all gather and start chatting idly about various things The topics varied everyday sometimes it would be about the latest movies sometimes about movie stars sometimes about people in the town sometimes about our future sometimes about the fantasies that we think of while working That day Maari was narrating his dreams I want to own a car and drive it through our town honking loud so that every body comes out to watch the procession Maybe I would also hit the supervisor with it I would want to buy a large house like with swimming pool and everything Naesappan continued the dream And what Fill it up with half-naked girls Mani asked He usually did not like such talks Maybe I will do that too Naesappan replied though he did not seem sure of why anyone would want to fill up a swimming pool with naked girls Don t start your lecture now about how dreaming is bad Maari said with some apparent irritation Dreaming is one of the few things we ve got here Sorna a ed Yes It is the only thing we ve got here But know that your dreams would never happen Or we ll end up being more disappointed than we are now Mani said Why so Why can t our dreams happen We are not going to be in the factory all our lives I said Maybe not But we d only end up in some other place doing something equally ordinary Have you ever seen people from our village own cars or houses with swimming pools Come on Be practical We all became silent We all were asking the same question of why such dreams could not happen It was difficult to digest the fact that we could end up doing such menial work all our lives Though all of us sensed it we wanted to still go on believing in the dreams we had Maari changed the topic before the knot in our throats choked us 
When I was about 15 years old I worked at the Country Club in our small town One of the grounds keepers would say the same thing every time that I saw him Today is history tomorrow is a mystery The logic here rings true but it was funny as he told me this 'm ini prayer almost daily like it was the first time he was saying it I would never call him out and say Dude you just told me that yesterday I guess that I sensed something was a bit off and I d let him preach his gospel to me based on the inner ramblings of his consciousness It seemed like he might be getting more out of it than me anyway The ringing in my ears is due to these same words playing on a constant loop cycle in my brain After joining EA 's Black Box studios here in Vancouver on December 1st It 's just been an onslaught of different trajectories coming at me quick There is little to nothing that I can say publicly at this point There are rumors certainly lots and lots of rumors So I will put it this way Need For Speed will continue Black Box will continue and hopefully I will still have a job The economic outlook means that EA needs to cut costs and overhead 
Pokey V2 0 There 's talk of another local robotic firefighting competition some time in May or June Pokey 's defeat in 2008 has nagged at me for the last couple years so time permitting Pokey and I are going to take another crack at it Pokey needs a refit and redesign Here are some of the topic areas I ll be covering in the near future -- -- but first what won t change No Dead Reckoning You may recall that Pokey does not use dead reckoning I want to continue with that design philosophy Pokey relied on wall following and events to navigate -- the appearance / disappearance while moving of walls and floor markers Smooth Speed Pokey was always intended to be a fast robot His name comes from the fact that I had to slow him down before the original competition to increase navigation reliability I don t want to slow him down further If anything I 'm hoping to speed up the little fella Also Pokey was built to move smoothly and fluidly through the maze and I don t want to change that either Budget Pokey was intended to be somewhat low buck with cheap minimalist solutions preferred over fancier more expensive ones where possible I may have to admit defeat in a few areas and throw some more money at the problem but I still want to come in under the cost of a Lego NXT when all is said and done Despite the things that won t change clearly some changes are needed for Pokey to complete his mission and these things will be the subject of upcoming articles Navigation Problems Thinking it through most of the navigation problems boil down to poor wall following and failing to execute precise turns The wall following system was marginal It could usually maintain a correct alignment but failed to correct even moderate misalignment A single wall distance sensor was inadequate given short maze walls and a fast robot A pair of wall distance sensors on each side should solve several problems at once While executing consistent constant radius turns wasn t too tough reliably turning to a precise heading was The trigger to terminate the turn was the distance of the wall that the robot was turning to It just didn t work I suspect using either a rate gyro or wheel encoders -- just for turning not dead reckoning -- would provide more precise heading changes and fluid movement If I can actually pull it off be assured you ll hear about it here Some robots had success aligning to the regulation door threshold floor stripe This approach alters the flow of robotic movement as it enters the room but maybe I can live with it if the gyro and encoder options don t pan out Flame Detection Problems Pokey failed to detect a flame the one time he encountered the candle in the contest I ran out of time to really dial in the calibration and software The sensor itself works ok at closer ranges poorly at long range It 's big and heavy limiting fire suppression system options and making Pokey less nimble Picture from superdroidrobots com of Hamamatsu UVtron Affording ( or justifying the cost of ) a UVtron or Eltec Pyroelectric flame sensor -- or a CMUcam or NXTcam vision sensor -- is tough The AVRcam is more affordable and apparently just as capable as these other two vision systems Or sticking with some form of IR detection is still a possibility I 'm currently exploring some cheap DIY camera / video options I really think that 's the best way to go since the last contest winner was using an NXTcam and very easily and reliably detected the candle Not to mention I could reuse this type of sensor for many other purposes More on vision in future articles Telemetry One of the biggest difficulties was that Pokey didn t collect data for later analysis I never quite knew what the robot was doing from moment to moment I 'm working on using bluetooth-based communication for telemetry reporting and logging More on this in an upcoming series of articles Collision Avoidance Finally it d be nice if the robot could priority override all other functions to prevent head-on wall collisions Of course the biggest challenge is time but at least I don t have to start totally from scratch at 7 00 AM 4 comments Labels firefighting Pokey Friday March 5 2010 Heathkit and Robots So I fixed up my Heathkit IO-12 oscilloscope and the Heathkit RG-8 frequency generator is next on the to-fix list I 'm also still working on building the oscilloscope calibrator it 's based on a Heathkit design Heathkit sold robot kits too as you may know I remember in college every time I passed the ground floor ECE Building labs looking in the big windows being greatly envious of the guys in the lab on the first floor of the ECE Building who got to play with the HERO 1 ( as above left ) I guess some of that envy shows in my goofy sketch of Edward Isaac Bot 's head what with the integrated hex programming keypad I think it 's safe to say that feature would be ditched in a modern verison Apparently a Heathkit HE-Robot 2000 is available these days a rebadged PC-Bot 914 from White Box Robotics (T he picture below is from Retro Thing presumably they got the pic from the Heathkit site or a news article or something ) 
WSDM 2010 Day 2 February 6th 2010 by Daniel Tunkelang Respond Note this post is cross-posted at BLOG CACM Unfortunately I woke up this morning rather under the weather so I 'm having to resort to remotely reporting on the second day of WSDM 2010 conference based on the published proceedings and the tweet stream The day started with a keynote from Harvard economist Susan Athey Her research focuses on the design of auction-based markets a topic core to the business of search which largely relies on auction-based advertising models ( cf Google AdWords ) Then came a session focused on learning and optimization One paper proposed a method to learn ranking functions and query categorization simultaneously reflecting that different categories of queries leads users to have different expectations about ranking Another combined traditional list-based ranking with pair-wise comparisons between results to separate the results into tiers reflecting grades of relevance An intriguing approach to query recommendation treated it as an optimization problem perturbing users query-reformulation path to maximize the expected value of a utility function over the search session Another paper looked not at ranking per se but rather at improving the quality of training data for using machine learning for ranking The final paper of the session which earned a best-paper nomination modeled document relevance based not on click-through behavior but rather on post-click user behavior The next session was about users and measurement It opened with another best-paper nominee a analysis of over a hundred million users to understand how they re-find web content Another offered a rigorous analysis of the often sloppily presented long-tail hypothesis it found that light users disproportionately prefer content at the head of distribution while heavy users disproportionately prefer the tail Another log-analysis paper analyzed search logs using a partially observable Markov model a variant of thehi en Markov model in which not all of the hi en state transitions emit observable events and compared the latent variables with eye-tracking studies An intriguing study demonstrated that user behavior models are more predictive of goal success than models based on document relevance The final paper of the session proposed methods for quantifying the reusability of the test collections that lie at the heart of information retrieval evaluation The last session of the day focused on social aspects of search Two of the papers were concerned with modeling authority and influence in social networks a problem in which I take a deep personal interest Another inferred attributes of social network users based on those of other users in their communities ( cg MIT 's Project Gaydar ) Another analyzed Flickr and Last fm user logs to show that users semantic similarity based on their tagging behavior is predictive of social links The final paper tackled the sparsity of social media tags by inferring latent topics from shared tags and spatial information Not surprisingly a disproportionate number of contributors to the conference work at major web search companies who have both the motivation to improve results and the access to data that is needed for such research One of the ongoing research challenges for the field is to find ways to make this data available to others while respecting the business concerns of search engine companies and the privacy concerns of their users 
Sunday Funday Got a call from old pal today who wanted to meet me And since i am not Busy i agreed We went to Ambiance Mall which i guess is one of the biggest Mall in India The gentry was beyond expectation lots to drool on :)) We also did play pool and then came back for Pizza @D ominoes In the end it turned out to be good Sunday rather then usual lazy ones Long Weekend Long weekend approaching yet again and i wasn t prepared as usual Too many things going and my mind is definitely working overtime so need a break I checked for available tickets and booked for Dehradun It would have been good if i had a company but then i don t want to be in city inspite as well I am planning to go to Mussorie a place where i had went during my childhood days once and have some memories to cheer Hopefully i would be able to meet Mr Ruskin Bond who lives there His stories about Shamli and Dehra are still so fresh I have absolutely no plans to have any kind of adventure just want to be there with the nature and sit back and relax 
In the second half of 2009 I picked up the Scholar 's Library Gold software package from Logos com There are literally thousands of resources available within that package It makes a computer nerd like me very happy to be able to study from the comforts of my easy chair with my laptop warming the tops of my legs I read three chapters a day and try to do so in the morning before doing anything else Currently I 'm working through an Old Testament reading plan from YouVersion com I start by reading an entire chapter Once finished with reading the text through I open up a few different commentaries and read what they have to say Then I browse other miscellaneous resources that come with the software I 'm always learning something interesting One recent example it 's thought that Joshua was a skilled military leader long before taking over for Moses and likely led the Egyptian army in battles Maybe it 's my inner nerd but I find things like that fascinating It paints a more colorful picture when I read about his conquests leading Israel Sometimes you have to watch somebody love something before you can love it yourself It is as if they are showing you the way Indeed Mr Miller indeed And so by watching a man love the Bible and trying to figure out WHY he loves it I too have discovered a love for the Bible Sometimes I 'm frustrated that I can t find the words to express this properly All I can say is dig into it and see for yourself 
single coloured rainbow Monday 15 March 2010 you are no more a vestige hanging in the corners of my consciousness the scent of joy was nothing but illusion never existed a conjuration for oasis in storms of desperation the smile you hung on your face a perfect portrait upon flawless wall like scabbard concealed the ugliness of your soul Posted by Takaloy at 23 52 0 comments Labels Poetry Cheap Pine Saturday 13 March 2010 It was not until much later during the day that I realised the irony of the title and my predicament It had not occurred to when I was drinking my favourite four espresso shots ice vanilla latte on a sunny ( to much subjectivity in British terms ) Saturday afternoon in my local Starbucks that my colleagues in all the tiresome complexities of office politics and guy-girl hormones would perhaps assume and most definitely make fine gossip of obsession or crush over a Norwegian girl who had just joined the team earlier this week It would perhaps be pathetic and immature to even remotely suggest that any regular decent gentleman ( or ruffian ) would not be objectively attracted to our new colleague She is in fact one of the more attractive people I ve had the pleasure to know in my miserable life I did perhaps was overly nice to her but it is part of my nature to all new colleagues I suppose they would assume I were gay if our new colleague were a guy My first impression of her was astonishingly fear I am afraid my incompetency in word-smiting cannot adequately describe the emotional stress that bombarded me that day warning signals flaring in my mind with 's tay away and run only to be saved on the grateful knowledge she is engaged It was a confirmation that I have indeed become caligynephobic If there were any women involved in the purchase of Haruki Murakami 's Norwegian Wood it would be from Ireland not of obsession or crush but of high opinion on taste I was not disappointed and the book was indeed a page turner and it took me a considerable deal of will and with a tiny extra push of my realization of the irony of the title of one or perhaps four too many of in this sentence I would perhaps on a later date write a review when I finish the book and to which this book will be annoying to carry about in all the unholy opinions that would consult the minds of my colleagues when I carry it in the morning Monday or should I saw Måndag So I lit the fire a fire isn t it good Norwegian Wood 
Another charming incident from the past decade is the time when a teacher in my college said to me Don t ask questions in class You re not supposed to Even teachers don t know everything Oh and the other teacher who answere dThat 's not in your syllabus- you don t need to know that It won t come on the exam They aren t to blame really They were a part of a system of education that was in dire need of an overhaul It was a system of education that was grounded in Victorian values of prudishness and proper conduct while completely disregarding the inquisitiveness and inventive spirit that spurred on the Industrial Revolution in the same culture that invented the Victorian values The teachers in Indian colleges are dismally paid and hence are barely interested though there were a few exceptions Is the pay changing in the New Decade Maybe Is the system of education changing I have seen signs of change promising ones in various colleges and universities all over India Unfortunately there is one thing that will hold Indian universities back- the bureaucracy 's utter lack of respect for the students ( again with some notable exceptions ) 
My name is Henrik and I 'm an Early Adopter I don t see being an early adopter as part of a competition to be first with new stuff I 'm just curious and can t help that I want to try out and learn new things all the time And I don t buy new things until I am convinced that they are useful to me It is not an easy life being an early adopter I don t recommend it An old wild west quote Pioneers are the ones with arrows in their backs And it is usually not the early adopters that make the money But I am proud of having adopted several important trends very early and my gut feelings for applications and functions are often accurate both for successes and lemons Interactive media I became a pioneer when I started the company Ahead Multimedia in 1988 Elearning I created an international award-winning elearning program in 1991 and in 1999 I worked in the US with an online elearning portal about parenting PDA 's and smartphones I switched from paper calendars in 1993 and started enjoying mobile email in 2002 The cloud To me this is probably the most important shift in computing ever moving from local files and applications that are locally stored in your computer to storing and running them online I started using online word processing in 2005 and immediately felt that this was the future of easy and collaborative computing 1986 My first Mac a 512K what a difference Used it with PageMaker 1 0 to produce course materials about script writing and print them on my Laserwriter Plus A SEK 100 000 investment that paid off I had previously worked a lot with computers such as the Swedish Luxor ABC800 1990 I bought my first mobile phone a brick-sized Ericsson Hotline NMT 450 it cost SEK 17 000 and the battery lasted for an hour or two but it was good to be mobile 1993 I discovered an new type of magazine that attracted me at the London Design Museum It was called Wired and wrote about technology and society in a new way I have been a subscriber ever since Here is the premiere issue from march 1993 still hanging on my kitchen wall 
Mirror Sometimes one fails to see oneself and dwells upon ones image that he wants to potray to the society Its all a game of illusion in ones mind It goes like this if i want to be someone i train myself to be someone but then i forget that pretending to be someone makes people fail to see the real me The simple solution as you might assume is to be truely oneself well unfortunately the story doesn t end there I mean its really good for everyone to be or potray truely what they are but then we all are in our own ways of being very judgemental It depends who can and who cannot stand against other 's callous judgements Anyways the point i am really trying to emphasise here is that when one doesn t like the way one is he tries to achieve to be someone else but what happens is he ends up pretending forever even before he has reached his goal which means that one lives in an illusion of oneself of how one wants to be seen and thats when people around him fail to see him and he himself fails to see the true him 
Sure it is a new world out there Especially if you owned Yahoo stock last night After an overnight gain of 48 % following Microsoft 's bid offer to buy yahoo I don t blame you if you have a grin the size of a football field Anyway this only brings to focus the new dynamics of the game - How software and business have changed over the past to adapt and embrace the medium of the Internet So if you are a CS / IT or a business student you will do well to take these points into consideration 1 The net is now the universal computer - the machine where we run software and store data When was the last time you accessed an encyclopedia or a dictionary in print or DVD form or get an entire roll of film or card full of images printed With online applications like Wikipedia Facebook and Flickr we are buying less and less packaged software and going online more and more for our computation needs With traditionally packaged software such as Office being available for use online as well it definitely signals the Net is the Computer era 
How good is a good client Posted by Scott on Mar 13 2010 in Marketing I have a client on paper that is a good client however in actuality I cringe every time she calls or when I see her She has three kids and we have photographed all three for senior pix and all 3 kids she spent over 3k each for their senior orders Plus we have done their family pictures with another large order So like I said she 's good on paper Why do I cringe Because she follows 0 % of our rules She takes months to order she pays right away but then takes months to place the order and when she does she submits partial orders and then wants it in like two days She 's always calling needing something done today she pushes everything right up to a deadline and then calls us on the day of the deadline to tell us about it ( like image submission for the yearbook for all three kids she called us on the deadline day and said I need this now ) 3x WTF and this year she did it twice because the first deadline was for the regular pix and then she called for a picture ad page in the yearbook with a different deadline She 's always changing her mind and has an attitude because she knows she spends a lot of money here so she thinks she owns me I hate people like that she is very unorganized and and wreaks havoc on our organized system Maybe that 's my main problem with her just dealing with her we just feel like we are always fixing her messes Kelly is sick of her It was funny a few months ago she did a typical move on placing a partial order and Kelly asked me why I let her do that I said because she 's a good customer To which Kelly replied without missing a beat like hell she is she may spend a lot of money here but she 's far from being a good customer it was a shocking thing for me to realize that a good customer and a big spender are two completely different things And in her case a repeat big spender but still a habitual chronic pain in our collective asses Hehe can you tell she just contacted me again about something Don t sell your soul or spine for money this is how we do it our relationship with her would be so much better had I stuck to our policies 4yrs ago when we photographed their first son Granted she loves us because I 'm like no problem Right away Sure Yes anything for you Why am I such a stupid person when it comes to her Kelly is funny when she sees her name pop up on the caller Id she says you better answer that because you don t want me talking to her so if you didn t notice Kelly has bigger balls than me But seriously I created this monster and this is their last kid but she 's already been talking about bringing in future grand babies for pix Oh shoot me now I guess I will have to deal with this situation I need a client intervention and some bigger balls lol 76 votes Buzz up 4 Working all weekend Posted by Scott on Mar 12 2010 in Marketing Well I did it to myself but i 'm working all weekend Saturday shooting seniors and one of the sessions is an outdoor session and it 's supposed to rain Then I agreed to shoot a family on Sunday It 's a client that has been coming to us for almost 10 years and they own a business that Sunday is the only day they can do it seriously I know a lot of clients claim they can t do any-other day but a Sunday but these guys are serious It 's going to be a very good order I 'm sure Maybe enough to pay for a year of college for the kids LOL Day 3 of P90x not so bad and actually my best day Kelly and I are doing it together it is fun so even if you hear me complaining it is kicking my butt but still fun Not as fun a Sweatin to the oldies would be I need to get me a Richard Simmons outfit to workout in Oh that would be sweet

Break up :( - well after two blogs which were depressing and political and i know many people do not have any interest in politics Now you must be thinking politics was less depressing than break up ( if you have gone through it ) Well before break up I wanted to go through the journey of love What is love According to oxford dictionary love is an intense feeling of deep affection and great interest in something or someone But what I guess is that while I am writing this blog really I am not having any words to describe it really it is an awesome feeling really yaar its just a great feeling your life changes You travel through ups and downs of life during love well I wanted to say I do not think that break up is a depressing word What do you think of A very great philosopher said that true love starts when nothing is looked for in return So if you are a true lover then praise break up also you must be thinking that I have gone mad but what I want to say is that why to live in illusion when you have the option to cut it out Please do not think that I am encouraging everyone for break up I just want to say that please do not make love a burden It is a gift given by god If you are not in true love you will feel that you were in a mess I used to believe in first sight love and still I do in spite of the fact that mostly first sight love is infatuation Please do not go for love on basis of appearance It is my request Somethings are ought to be attained with patience Look for the better part of break up Understand each other better Make sure that this is the person you are looking for and bells must be ringing for the person in your heart Well after a long lesson I am just sorry if I have offended any body Please forgive me it was just overflow of emotions Do not take it otherwise 
This is my religion I hail from a country that is known for its multicultural multi-religious multi-people diversity For the people of the west India is a land of mystery that can only be demystified by the understanding of religion and philosophy As an Indian I know that we are just another set of people striving hard to improve the way we live and the way people around us think of us It is true that India has so many religions that it could be incredibly interesting to know about all of them It 's almost like the rainbow all colors emerging from the same source and still having such different forms and perceptions But things are not always what they look like From a rainbow it may have now become an illusion which is so hard to understand that millions of the followers are driven to the limits of insanity while trying to find answers for their souls I can t ask you what religion is I don t find myself capable enough and don t expect you to provide an answer that would end all the miseries that this word has hurled upon us Now this is a dangerous thing to say Religion and misery But things are quite like this in most parts of the world Today we talk about global citizenship and economies expanding beyond the political and cultural boundaries and yet we have people with complete intolerance towards others views on something that is such a private affair religion I really fail to understand why people choose to comment on the beliefs of other people with very little or no understanding of their lives and / or religion I think that religion is all about making peace with yourself and the community that you belong to So what happens when this process of making peace with you start to intrude into other lives and their right to a peaceful life That 's when the clashes start and people like us start to question the whole point of having such a structure like religion to unite people There are other forms in which segregations can be made and a common peace can be thought of but the question remains is it always necessary to segregate the society into sects based on one thing or the other Like always I don t have the answer to this question 
Rahul - Those who are reading this blog first time I ll suggest you to read the previous post first While my father was doing all the fee payment work and I was just roaming ( admiring ) the building a boy came to me and asked Are you Abhyuday I asked to myself Am I so famous I said yes he told me that he ALSO is in 11th class foundation course in here as if he he knows everything about me Then he showed his father and my father talking with each other My father had cosen a room suitable for me to live in and study according to every possible condition Far from traffic near from garden at walking distance from the main building and not too near to walk While we were resting in the room my father told me that he has invited that boy ( Rahul ) to live in this house That house had 4 rooms 3 of which were already occupied then Rahul 's father mother visited and liked it and finalize it In the evening everyone came i e Rahul and the house owner and other 2 roommates one of them was doing some job and was about to leave in 15 days and another was an AIEEE aspirant 12th just passed Ajit Midhan House owner was a kind man in the first impression That night we ( my father and I ) went to buy all the stuff essential for living cup plate tumbler powder soap oil comb bed pillow water purifier gas cylinder and most importantly two notebooks as from the next day my classes were going to start from 3 00 p m to 8 00 p m For 2 days my father did everything woke me up made tea for me cleaned the room and my bed and what I did just went class Next day when I returned from the class after having dinner in the mess which was on the way to class I did not found him his train was at 9 00 p m I thought I shouldn t have dinner and should have come room early I felt unsafe all alone in an unknown place I was really scared I was all my own Then Rahul came and asked me to play cricket ( inside the house ) we played and slowly slowly that feeling was gone Parents I tell you their love and care are undefined My father knew that I will have this condition that 's why he approached Rahul 's parents made us known to each other before he 's gone For 3-4 days we played cricket and only cricket and did nothing except going class One day while I was coming back from the class along with Rahul I found a 10 Rs note in the road I bought 2 icecreams 5 Rs each That was the first thing I have ever bought for myself I never got a chance I hate to go to shop with my mother she starts bargaining from 40 % of the price told by the shopkeeper if it is a salesman its starting price will be 10 % of the price told by the salesman And if I am with my father I never ask anything its his money if he wants to give me something from his money I should not ask for anything I should be very thankful to him So I don t buy stuff for myself After 3-4 days we ( I and Ajit midhan ) had a quarrel because of some cricket issues Then after 2-3 days from that we ( I and Rahul ) had a quarrel because of a waking up issue He did not wake me up and went to the class alone and when I was expecting apologies from him he laughed at me Then I met Amul he was 1 week late for the class He came to me and asked for the notes he was from Jabalpur near to my place 
Reservation Policy and Politics - Reservation on any cast clan or sex is undemocratic and leads to inefficiency and second -rate standards This is the line given by our first prime minister late Pt Jawahar Lal Nehru It was told when India became independent At the same time 1948-1949 the father of constitution Dr B R Ambedkar had a note of caution for future governments that large scale quotas could destroy the rule of equality of opportunity He revealed that reservation quotas should be consistent with the constitution and must be confined to minority of seats But do you think that this line is consistent in today 's scenario DEFINITELY NOT :( Lets start from the beginning of the Indian civilization Earlier the Hindu SAMAJ was divided into four major classes ( earlier called verna ) namely Brahmins Kshytriyas Vaisyas and Sudras Brahmins were at the top of the varna hierarchy Kshytriys were the second third were the Vaisys and Sudras ( the untouchables ) The cast was decided on the basis of occupation At that time Sudras were not permitted to visit place like temple etc This was the time which lead to the concept of reservation Because at that time if the society would have not been divided it would be impossible to think a word like RESERVATION Reservation in favour of Backward Class was introduced in many states such as Maharastra etc in many fields In 1902 Maharastra introduced reservation to eradicate poverty amongst minority groups and to give their share in state administration The notification of 1902 gave 50 % reservation in service for backward classes After that it became a trend which is an older one but a big hit for collecting votes and publicity in a short period of time Scheduled Caste (S C ) and Tribes (ST ) constitute approximately 22 % of the country 's population Accordingly a reservation of 22 5 % has been made for them in educational institution which come under the control of MHRD and other central ministries Similar reservations proportional to their population have also been provided by the state governments and union territory administrations SC and ST students are also entertained a relaxation with respect to their upper age limit as well as concession of lower cut-off qualifying marks Besides reservation for SC and ST candidates reservation is also provided for other categories of backward classes ( OBC ) In 1978 the second backward classes commission under the chairmanship of B P Mandal was set up The commission which submitted its report in 1980 and recommended the reservation of 27 % of the seats in all scientific technical and professional institutions run by the central as well as state governments for OBCs It further recommended that those States which have already reserved more than 27 % seats for OBC students would remain unaffected by this recommendation The Government of India implemented the recommendations in 1990 leading to violent protests Besides caste based reservations there are also varieties of reservation and quota system for example Non-resident Indians (5%) Women (30%) Physically handicapped Migrants from J K NCC Quota Sports Quota Anglo-Indian Community Children of Political Sufferers Children of Defence personnel Children of Ex servicemen Government of India Nominees The supreme court had earlier ruled that the total percentage of reservation should not exceed 50 % but also inserted an economic clause in the name of what is called creamy layer Now this word has become a headache for the government in the sense of its definition The norms which should be full filled for the status of creamy layer is still a matter of debate Later reservation were introduce for other sections as well The supreme court ruling that reservations can not exceed 50 % has put a cap on reservations However there are states laws that exceed this 50 % limit and these are under litigation in the supreme court For example the caste based reservation is about 70 % in Tamil Nadu The reservation in Tamil Nadu is much with respect to other part of India When the first reservation protest hit New Delhi in May 2006 the people of Tamil Nadu were pleading to implement it in the state When students and doctors in Delhi were agitating by hunger strike and facing water cannon students and doctors in Tamil Nadu were demanding reservation Doctors in Chennai including Indian Association members were in the forefront expressing their support for reservation in institutions of higher education run by the central government Bihar is also not far behind in this prospect ( the government of Bihar had given 50 % reservation in public sector job for women ) The political issue of reservation in education institution is so important fundamental and explosive that every time it comes up for debate politicians get into their act Human resource development minister Arjun singh proposed the bill for 27 % of reservation to OBC in 2005 When the bill for reservation ( OBC ) was presented in the parliament it got about 95 % votes in favour Hence Arjun Singh was successful in alluring a large population in form of OBC The BJP can t digest such a huge amount of the vote is going Congress way It somewhat convincingly asked why minority-managed ( meaning Christian and Muslim institutions ) are not included in the amendment (s uch colleges and institutions were not included for reservation ) Answering to this question HRD minister Arjun Singh could not hide hide his happiness when he replied to the opposition why minority institutions cannot be included After that the BJP tried to take advantage by introducing a bill to get Muslim and Christian institutions under the bill proposed for OBC But the bill was not passed because it lost by a large margin ( got only 25 % vote in favour ) Now after the implementation of these reservation and relaxations the minorities establish and administer educational institutions are becoming so commercial that poor and backward students are not able to afford the fee Due to this reason in Andhra pradesh alone about 10000 engineering seats were not filled up last year because they could not find students who can pay for those seats So again its a matter of debate that even after 50 % reservation poor students are not able to get a seat in college How ever reservation continues to be a controversial social and political issue and has resulted many protracted legal disputes Apart form all this there is not even a single organisation who is working for eradication of reservation If it continues in the same way then a day will come when every body will be trying to get certificate for SC ST or OBC status Which has already started in the form of GUJJAR AANDOLAN 
Socrates Here is a story quite similar to my earlier post on Kabir 's Doha -------In ancient Greece Socrates was a great philosopher and widely acclaimed for his wisdom One day a friend ran up to him excitedly and sai dSocrates do you know what I just heard about one of your students called Plato Wait a moment Socrates replied Before you tell me anything I would like you to answer a few test questions It 's called the Triple Filter Test µTriple filter asked the friend That 's right Socrates continued Before you talk to me about my student I am going to ask you three questions The first Filter is Truth Have you made absolutely sure that what you are about to tell me is true No the man sai dactually I just heard about it and All right 's aid Socrates So you are not sure if it 's true or not Now let 's try the second filter the Filter of Goodness Is what you are about to tell me about my student something good No on the contrary said the man So Socrates continue dyou want to tell me something bad about him even though you re not certain it 's true The man shrugged a little embarrassed Socrates continued You may still pass the Triple Filter test though because there is a third filter - the Filter of usefulness Is what you want to tell me about my student going to be useful to me No not really Well concluded Socrates if what you want to tell me is neither True nor Good nor even Useful why tell it to me at all The man was defeated and ashamed 
So rather that spending a couple of hours running up and down the stairs putting her back into bed for that illusive afternoon snooze my very clever and very lovely wife decided to bring mealtimes forward a bit and put her up to bed earlier in the evening I guess I ve been a little blinded by the 's he must have her afternoon nap mantra and hadn t really considered the alternatives So I ll stick my neck out once again and say that so far things are going pretty well Meal times have been brought forward by an hour as has bedtime Okay a downside is that I don t get a break in the afternoon to catch up with a few DIY jobs or to just chill out for a bit but that 's no big deal Now when Mrs D gets home from work Miss D has already eaten dinner and they can play for a bit then we pack her off to bed and get to eat our dinner at a reasonable hour and have a bit more of an evening together Miss D 's legendary late-afternoon tantrums haven t been an issue either clever mummy 
The JVM-Garbage To Begin with - Recently I was asked to asked to analyze the behavior of heap in java application ( with lots of short lived objects and highly transactional processes ) Here is what I came to know - Java is a programming language where object creation and destruction is handled by JVM itself and this indeed is handled by one of its process called GC ( garbage collector process ) Four algorithm is available ( not specific to Java vendor ) For the defined case gencon is considered to be best For most of the cases gencon policy will work fine Heap ( memory ) is divided into two physical part Nursery ( NEW ) and Tenured ( OLD ) Space Nursery space is logically further divided into Allocated ( Eden ) and Survivor Space New ( young ) objects gets a place in Eden Once the eden is full ( or partly filled depends on the setting ( JVM option ) ) the process called SCAVENGE is called ( in gencon policy of garbage collection ) This process will clean up the eden space i e deallocates the memory space of the objects no longer in use and copies the objects to 's urvivor space ( or tenured space depending upon the age of object ) As soon as the scavenger is called the initial eden space is now referred as survivor space ( yes empty ) and objects in previous survivor space ( yes now eden / allocated space ) gets their age increased by 1 As stated previously the objects can get copied logically to survivor or physically to Tenured area The destination depends upon the ThreshholdTenuredAge parameter ( in JVM setting or dynamically set by JVM in default case ) Scavenge process is light weight ( wrt CPU utilization ) frequent scavenge is called ( as the application supposedly had lots of short lived objects ) The major overhead while cleaning garbage is clearing up Tenured Area where the objects with high age has been allotted space This is done by GLOBAL garbage collection which is triggered when the space in Tenured in not enough to accommodate new object from nursery to tenured area ( through scavenge this is called Allocation Failure ) Global GC clears up Tenured Area and frees the memory Global GC ( and scavenge also ) is Stop the World Phase where the application thread is paused and ONLY gc thread works Garbage collection process mainly has three phases ( and all the phases work as single step (s top the world hehe ) ) 1 Mark - That is marking all LIVE objects 2 Sweep - Cleaning / freeing and updating free list 3 Compact - ( optional ) reduce fragmentation ( time taking ) Bad coding is natural gift to all the expert programmers ( no offense ) still this can get worse if the JavaHeap is not perfectly set that is BAD JVM OPTION For instance The JVM OPTION -Xmx512m means set maximum heap size to 512MB and the java application regularly throws OOM Exception ( OutOfMemory Exception ) tuning is required Need not be happy the above objective case is not always the situation The case can be really complicated as improving performance of an application based on Memory leaks or availability is a tough and subjective task Google for Java Vendor Specific JVM OPTIONs (d epends on version too ) and do dome permutation to tune in a good application However the theoretical aspect can by analyzed to reduce the set of eligible jvm settings In order to analyze the garbage collection enable the verbose in JVM setting ( as the name suggests verbose ( who speaks a lot ) is a log which tells the whole story of heap in elaborated xml format This complicated log can be analyzed on various freely available tool and hence the memory behavior can be studied Later parameters like fixing nursery size tenured size total heap size size ratio Garbage collection policy max tenured age etc can be modified Make sure while tuning you degrade one feature to get another settle as soon as end user says OK Happy tuning (p lease google for various JVM options ) 
GEORGE LUCAS GONNA SUE SOMEBODY ++++++++ UPDATE +++++ I checked out a few boards last nite and it seems this latest post has rubbed some folks the wrong way Let me try to a ress here some of the most common complaints some of the game forum folks seem to be having 1- I AM NOT SUE HAPPY- I have never sued anyone and unless someone really steps over the line I look at lawsuits as a last line of defense Trust me as someone who gone thru the process of being sued the whole thing is a nasty nasty expensive business and it seems- to me- that it is meant to be Like burying someone divorce our complicated tax system and so many other institutions of our society that are important but more and more just seem like they exist for the sake of big business there 's a whole lot of people with expensive suits and expensive degrees who make a crap ton of cash off lawsuits And I sure as hell don t want to contribute to their bottom line And that is why I suggested sending a letter I would guess in 99 % of cases like this no one is out to harm anyone else It is simply a misunderstanding or an oversight that when brought to light could be corrected I harbor no ill will or resentment towards the people making SCRAP METAL or the people making WAR OF THE GODS They both sound like products right up my alley and I will be purchasing a download and a ticket to each one respectively once they hit whatever their names end up being 2- YOU ARE NOT AN EXPERT AT COPYRIGHT LAW AND NEITHER AM I- I know experts in copyright law ( I actually do ) and you sir are not an expert in copyright law With the exception of MAYBE 1 % of the people who are even aware of this discussion we are having you don t know if my claims have merit in court and neither do I And frankly just because you or I think we are right on this there is no real right or wrong There is a judge who decides if there is a case and if there is then there is a jury who decides who wins the case And there is a lot of gray area simply because- while the law is very concrete- the subjective interpretation of that law requires a human brain I can tell you that when I saw the titles they rubbed me the wrong way and seemed worth mentioning I can live with the fact that I could be wrong and I can live with the fact that most folks may not agree with me This doesn t make me an idiot and it doesn t make you a genius YOU go spend your precious time on this planet working with others and giving everything you ve got to create some intellectual property and I assure you you will feel protective of it Again being protective does not mean my assumption that these titles cross the line is right But being a smarmy asshole- like a good % of board posters have been towards me over this issue- doesn t make you right either It just makes you a smarmy asshole NOTE It has been pointed out to me that because my issues are clearly with title and not idea this is a TRADEMARK LAW issue not a COPYWRIGHT LAW issue Fair enough I stand corrected on the type of law My comments and thoughts still stand tho 3- TONE- See the big Chris Rock picture You know the comedian See the quote from a Kevin Smith movie that I use for the title of this post See the smiley face at the bottom of this post People I 'm not on a crazy rampage about this I never said I was going to sue anyone I was bringing it up as something that interests me and something I thought would be worth sharing with people who come to this blog to hear about- mainly- my game making life And I was doing so in a lighthearted manner I assure you this is the farthest thing from a big deal in my life If nothing were to change on this front I really would not care 4- FOR THE LOVE OF FUCK- Finally for the people who are like JAFFE GET BACK TO WORK ON YOUR GAME please let me assure you I am working very hard The team is working very hard Sony is working very hard We are all busting ass and- even tho we may not agree on these particular legal issues- we are still eager to entertain each and every one of you with what we ve got cooking Just like you I don t work 24 hours a day 7 days a week Even during my day I take breaks But as some of you know I work at home So while at your job you may hang in the breakroom with your bu ies and chat about last nite 's episode of LOST or what game you are playing I video chat with friends and I blog Fucking sue me But the point IS we are working hard on our game and we re looking forward to showing it to you today on GTTV oh wait that 's not us :) Ok so that 's my update Thanks for reading Later END UPDATE ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Ok maybe not Lucas but Sony should Or if I owned the rights to TWISTED METAL and GOD OF WAR I sure as hell would at the least send a sternly worded legal letter Heck I d send two legal letters if it were me I mean first Microsoft puts out a car combat game and calls it SCRAP METAL Hey looks like a great game Right up my alley Day one purchase for me But come on guys isn t that just a little too close to Sony 's own car combat game TWISTED METAL And then Sony has GOD OF WAR a game and potential movie about mortals fighting ancient Greek Gods And then this movie gets announced called WAR OF THE GODS about- yep - mortals fighting ancient Greek Gods And look Sony doesn t- and should not- own the concept of the Greek Myths Nor should they own the idea of mortal fighting ancient Gods Greek or any other kind That 's all public domain stuff But the TITLE Sony DOES own that And GOD OF WAR / WAR OF THE GODS seem a little too close to comfort ya ll Anyway like I said not my fight I don t own shit :) David 
With what I hear you cry Well keeping my blog updated for starters So indeed a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to anyone that might be reading this The last couple of months have been pretty manic and I ve got a lot of jobs to get finished around the house before our next little one arrives ( the due date being 19th April ) I 'm working hard though whilst generally running around like a headless chicken Mrs D just spent the week at the in-laws with Miss D giving me a chance to get ahead with the main project refitting our bathroom Much progress was made although at the moment we have no bath no plaster on most of the walls and a to do list as long as both my arms I loved Miss D 's reaction when she first saw it Mummy what happened to the bathroom Da y broke it I love that to ler black white kind of logic I smiled and told her that Da y will fix it as he does with all the toys and books that Miss D manages to damage or break 
In Kolkata - Here in kolkata the things people perception of people are so different The same intro talk which would otherwise have inspired hundreds of youths to join our YES + bandwagon is also not making any difference God / Guru certainly loves fun thats for sure And time again makes us realize us to surrender since we are instruments and HE is the musician In the meanwhile I did few satsangs and quite a few are lined up for coming days Even attended Vikram dada 's satsang and had a knowledge session with him exclusively for YES + I saw AVATAR in 3d which was like superbly fantabulous Something that 's beyond someone imagination If you haven t seen it yet do yourself a favour and watch it I m yet to see 3 idiots And right from the day we have landed here the thing i have been doing the most is eating and eating and eating some more I guess I have also put up some weight Will keep ou all posted about the happenings here Jaigurudev 
I just finished reading Tokyo Vice An American Reporter on the Police Beat in Japan by Jake Adelstein after seeing a post on Tokyo Mango about it I rate it up there with the classic The Enigma of Japanese Power by Karel Van Wolferen and my more recents favorites Dogs and Demons by Alex Kerr and Tokyo Underworld The Fast Times and Hard Life of an American Gangster in Japanby Robert Whiting All of these books provide a thoughtful view of Japan from the perspective of a non-Japanese and I think are essential readings for anyone trying to understand modern Japanese history and culture So much of the really important underlying context and culture isn t translated from Japanese into English and even if it were it would be mostly incomprehensible without framing it in a Western context Jake Adelstein does a great job of making the book very fun to read personal and accurate His background as a professional Japanese journalist covering crime in Japan for the Japanese edition of Yomiuri one of Japanese mammoth newspapers a 's a lot of credibility and cultural sensitivity that are lacking in most books about Japan that are written by non-Japanese I also liked the way that the book presented the perspective of the Japanese underground and Japanese culture through personal stories and narrative and didn t try to explain all of Japan It 's nearly impossible even for Japanese to understand why things are the way they are in Japan and it 's only through experience and listening to stories like Jake 's that you can begin to stitch together your version of Japan In The Way of Zen by Alan Watts Watts describes that it is impossible to explain in English all that is Zen In fact the Zen masters explain that Zen is beyond words He describes how most Japanese Zen masters do not even try to explain Zen He admits that although his Western background and his attempt to explain Zen in words by definition fails to capture the true core essence of Zen However he argues that because he lives between both worlds he is able to describe Zen in words much more clearly than the masters might imagine That 's what I think about the good books about Japan written by non-Japanese Japanese often don t explain context or pretend that everyone knows what is going on I think this leads to a lot of misunderstanding and the development of unspoken rules and culture shared only be small groups of people hi en in most part from the public Publishers in Japan are also very sensitive about publishing books about taboo subjects in Japanese I highly recommend the book

Round the world tickets ( RTW ) are by far the most economical way to travel if you actually go around the world a lot The only thing about round the world tickets is that you can only cross each ocean once and can not leave a region and return to it I had one week between my board meeting in New York for WITNESS and my talk at SXSW so it totally didn t make sense for me to fly back to Dubai and break the RTW ticket I was looking for a convenient place to park myself and get some work done and I remembered that my old friend Eric Haller lived in Costa Rica and seemed to have situation of having broadband ie able to play World of Warcraft and be immersed in a very relaxing environment I met Eric in 1990 when I was working on the film Indian Runner - the first movie Sean Penn directed I was working for the executive producer Thom Mount and Eric was a 2nd assistant director We were around the same age and were similarly over-worked and under-paid for the few months that we worked on location in Omaha together We hung out a bit and kept in touch Later Eric lived in San Francisco and started blogging where we 'm et up again After that Eric joined my World of Warcraft guild We Know and still serves as one of my Guild Administrators About three years ago Eric moved to Puerto Viejo I messaged Eric and told him that I was looking for a place to park for a week He encouraged me to visit him in Puerto Viejo Puerto Viejo is on the Caribbean side of Costa Rica not the Pacific side which is where most of the tourists go The big town on the Caribbean side is Limon but there are no flights to Limon from any reasonable US airport Eric picked me up in San Jose Costa Rica with a driver in the mi le of a crazy storm and it took us over six hours of pretty treacherous driving across Costa Rica to get to Puerto Viejo Eric had warned me to bring a raincoat - now I knew why The road was full of potholes that felt more like mini land-mines but we made it in one piece It was late when we arrived so we had a quick bite at the local Italian place and called it a night When I got to my hotel room there was something about the quiet sound of the rain and the jungle animals that sort of made me nervous at first and then jerked me into another reality I fell asleep and didn t wake up for another 10 hours I don t think I can remember when I last slept that long Eric came over told me to put my watch away and stash everything into the little safe except a photocopy of my passport and a little wad of cash We didn t have a plan That was the point We wandered to the local store in our flip flops on the dirt road The store had one kind of bottled water one kind of hair brush tree ripe bananas papaya pineapple and just about everything you d ever need but nothing more We bought a bunch of fruit and headed off to his house 
The Trauma of Restlessness Its 1 am midnight and nothing to do I just lost my mobile as it is took by examination wing bloody Airtel they sent me the message in mi le of the exam and it wasnt in silent mode :( Anyhow just few days back i finished my examinations and as usual i m not sure i will pass all of them Now i want to discuss few patterns which i observed while preparing and writing the exams and i find them very critical and we must discuss them 1 The first thing of all is about Cricket Last year when we play cricket we use to practise on the main ground instead of going behind sps or somewhere else Now we all can imagine the rush on the ground and the chaos after 5pm The thing which needs notice is that the form of all the batsmen of Team gets affected They scored runs but were not in the touch they used to be in 2 I also noticed that in a home the kid who got scolded for studies always performs inferior than his sibling who is not scolded Now dont say that one who didnt study had to face the nagging and its usual Lets make it more clear The one who is naughty or say full of energy is first gets the praise of parents and neighbours for his cleverness but later age of around 8-10 years his naughtiness increases and the parents start scolding him for o a thing or two and then for everything Also the cleverness he showed ( assumed by his parents ) is not visible in his studies and the one who is less clever got the same grades or better And then comes the most common and used phrase My this child is intelligent but i dont know why he dont study And its really very good fortune of parents if that clever child shows better performance in his remaining life because very few did it 3 This time while writing exams the only thing which comes to my mind is football Intermilan Barcelona Chelsea and all that When exam gets over these things also goes out of my mind Now what is the thing linking above three paragraphs Now let me explain you the cases one by one First in Cricket there is a term called Comfort Zone in batting Thats why a out of form batsman is adviced to use nets rather than playing more matches to retain his Comfort Zone 1st story of my cricket team is that all the batsmen while playing in the chaos lost their comfort zone and lost the touch 3rd story is about for last 1 month i downloaded nearly 50gb of football and kept watching that in every free time Now while studies the thing which runs in my mind is football The brain got a speciality to emulate the conditions you keep it in and while exams i gave my brain few conditions like pen and paper and it emulate the thought process i use to be in while pen and paper and thats thinking about football Now the 2nd and most sa ening story Everyone catches habit of the thing we repeatedly do Parents also gets into the habit of scolding their child and which they do considering it a very small matter Now a child after nagging when sits to study cannot achieve a thing which we call is Comfort Zone The thing runs to his mind is restlessness his ego and his brains immediately in a year or two comes into the habit of No Comfort Zone This is also trmed as a disease ADHD or simply A And whenever a child sits down to study his brain didnt let him to do so by coming to NO Comfort Zone And it could be seen in our socity that usually elder brother is relatively better in studies than younger becuse the younger one got more energy and of course as he emulates his elder brother his acts seems to be more clever according to his age but his cleverness is not at all visible in his grades And everyone scolds him for not spending enough time in studies There starts his training of loosing the habit of concentration The comfort zone is the thing which is so important that you can crack an exam if you retain it and could underperform if you cant The preperation is not the only thing which matters 
My first DSN September 1999 It was the first time I was attending a DSN course Rashmin Rajesh Jagasia Harshal and a few of our common friends we all were on it I think it was the first one in Mumbai Arunaji from Gujarat was our teacher The intensity was increasing as each day progressed I had decided I will be repeating this course at the earliest to be able to assimilate its intensity One of the partcipants took permission to go to his house for a while and come back We all were surprised at his courage to even ask for a break in DSN course He looked very happy after he returned The course got over and he shared his experience I went home to see if my mother was alright She had just got discharged from the hospital after a serious illness and nobody was at home To my surprise she scolded me for taking a break from the course and sai dA man in white robes and long hair and beard came and gave me medicines I am fine You focus on your course come on go asap There were tears in his eyes as he narrated this The power of the grace is infinite And the Guru 's grace is with us every moment By the end of the course I too had realised that nothing is impossible I am the power Next month I repeated the DSN with BAWA An interesting story about that DSN I can tell you only sitting with you face to face bcoz its kind of a secret - ) Well 10 years later I conducted a DSN in Delhi - Oct 2009 
Hindi Literature - Hindi is the descendant of Sanskrit which is written in Devnagri script It has been affected by different languages such as Turkish Farsi Arabic Portugese and English It is a very expressive language with rich vocabulary and precise word for each action Trough its poetry and song it can express emotions love and nationalism by using simple and gentle words It has been declared as the official language according to our constitution In India it is spoken in UP Bihar Rajasthan Madhya Pradesh Uttrakhand Chatisgarh Jharkhand and other parts of Inida as secondary language There are a number of dialects of this language some of them are Awadhi Kannajui Maithili Magahi Bhojpuri and marwari and khariboli All the innovative work done in these languages is considered to be a part of Hindi litrature Apart from this Hindi is also spoken in Pakistan Nepal SA Mauritius Uganda and Singapore The Hindi literature is divided into four major forms they are 1 Adi kaal 2 Bhakti kaal 3 Ritikavya kaal and 4 Adhunik kaal In the ancient period the main center of development of Hindi were Delhi Ajmer kannauj and the central part of India Madhya pradesh Chand Bardai composed a poem for his king Prithviraj Chauhan named Prithviraj Raso whic is considered as the first work in the history of Hindi literature After the defeat of Prithviraj Chauhan all most all creative work in the field of Hindi was destroyed and a very few scriptures or manuscripts are available This era is considered as aadi kaal During the later part of aadi kaal and early Bhakti kaal many sint-poets became famous and Vidyapati was one of them Bhakti kaal It is considered as the mi le stage of the development of Hindi literature The work in this period mostly comprises of long poems There was a great development in the field of poetry during this period Different form of poems like Dohas and Chupaya are the innovations of this period Again Bhakti kaal can be divided into two catogeries 1 Nirgrna ( the followers of a formless god ) Kabir and Gurunanak were followers of Nirguna And 2 Saguna ( the followers of God with attributes ) Surdas and Tulsidas were followers of Saguna In the very time most of the poems were written in Avadhi or Braj Bhasha The major works of this period are Padmavat and Ramcharitmanas written by Malik Muhammad jayasi and Tulsidas respectively Sur Sagar written by Surdas was a graet work in Braj Bhasha This was the age when two diverse religion the Hindu and the Islamic mingled together to server the Hindi literature Many Muslim poets like Abdul Rahim who was a court poet of Akbar was a great devotee of Krishna and used to write in Hindi Ritikavya Kaal During this period the erotic element became dominant This era is called Riti bucause this was the age when poetry forms and theory were developed to the fullest But this affected the poetry by taking its emotive aspect which was considered as chief aspect of the Bhakti kaal and the poetry gradually started deteriorating The most well known book of this age is Satasai written by Bihari Adhunik kaal This is considered as the period after 1900 The man who brought life in the hindi literature was Premchand Before him the Hindi literature was considered as fictitious He is considered as one of the best story writer and novelist in the field of Hindi By this time hindi had become the general public 's language To distinguish themselves from the general masses the learned Muslims used to write in Urdu while Khadiboli became prominent among educated Hindus Khadiboli with heavily Sanskritized vocabulary or Sahityik Hindi was popularized by the writings of Swami Dayanand Saraswati Bhartendu Harishchandra and others importantwriters of this period are Mahavir Prasad Dwivedi Maithili Sharan Gupt etc The rising numbers of newspapers and magazines made Khadiboli popular among the educated people Today Hindi is at a juncture where it is being considered to loose its race with English Even though declared as the National language and official language higher class people and people working in corporate world use it rarely Hence it is the time when the whole India the government employee and government funded institution should come forward and make Hindi as an official language and the LANGUAGE OF INDIA 
Scammed ep2 - When you come to a different country a lot of things take a turn I mean apart from your bank balance which just decides to take a dive and only afterwords does it realize that he ( or it ) forgot to tie the Bunjee rope Apart from that it all of a su en changes for good or for bad depends on how unlucky or lucky you are ( I dont believe in Hard work ) And there are times that you are led to believe that the whole world is bent on picking on you for no reason It can start with a small thing like that innocent lady who walks her dog every day on the pavement and with whom you had a 3 month long good morning routine ignores you and su enly starts telling Lucy ( the dog )\ dont bark at this person repetedly or that dog peeing on you or you stepping on dogs poop or you dropping your half eaten candy bar which you found under your pillow that morning or a million other things And then it graduates to your boss at work telling you repetedly how incompetent you are with all his sarcastic charm or your system at work crashing down or just one or two softwares which you need to work crashing down or you forgetting to load the 150 lines code which you had developed last night to your jump drive ( I 'm not a computer geek so 150 is still big for me ) or forgetting to take your jump drive after you had remembered to load it or you realizing that you should ve just emailed the code to yourself or well you know the stuff What i 'm trying to get at is that when all this becomes a part of your life you end up being vulnerable to possibilities of something good and at the sight of a bleak ray of hope you follow it ignoring the fact that that bleak ray of hope might be coming from the patented lamp made by Hope Inc and was carried by a fellow with a crooked nose and one eye and a skeleton arm and a flea crown who just happened to find you in that dark tunnel So if your imagination is still in working condition you d know by now what this is leading to Yes a description of another scam We live in a quite place in Chicago ( come to think of it US is quite in general unless at war ) me and my roommate are students and are looking for another roommate On being suggested to put up advertisements online (s omething you just have to get used to internet and we are just not that used to the whole internet thing and you might wanna contest that but if you dont think its true youre hardly an Indian anymore ) Craiglist Sulekha ( yes it works here too or here only ) and what not But have you ever heard the saying the best deal is what you pay for me neither just made that up but still I took that seemingly credible advice and found a paid service that would find me a roommate Roommates com i pay for 3 days premium service after i started getting replies on my profile which i could see only if i pay for it ( its a neat revenue generating technique come to think of it ) and see the replies 16 yr old Gay male a transgender prostitute transgender hot looking chick student student hot chick gay female student one who admits she smokes a lot hot chick summarize the replies Hot chicks and students were the first to get my replies which is any normal person would do Students didn reply back one Hot chick (p lease notice capital H of Hot ) wants to come and stay Yes she doesn want to see the apartment doesn want any other place she wants to send the money to me by a cashiers check through her agent who is also arranging for her flight she sells african beads and is from Spain she sends her pics and i 'm flat ( awesome figure 5 feet 8 sends her pics wearing velvet pants what do you expect ) we have long email sessions ( the email conversation was almost 25 replies long by now i even know her philosophy in life her roommates in Spain why she went into the bead business and they were all very good conversations she signed off with your future roommate ) Then it stopped I have not entertained any other reply from anyone else cuz she wants me to confirm before she sends money ( of course ) and then she doesn send any reply nothing i want to know when is she sending the money what s the order number ( they have that thing where you can track the packages internet ) I dont wanna spend from my pocket which is empty anyways Nothing I put the ad again and then she is back Hey sorry I was in Africa for some business heres the details 23-watever-234351 ( you can imagine a nagging female voice to go along with it might be fun ) I check the status theres nothing to be found and after some time it gets delivered Now what has not been told yet is that my ex-roomie expected it to be scam from the start I just took him as a sadist and didn care much at first but when i saw a the scam alert on the website well then you have to stop thinkin that luck was on your side all this time I shoot an email with the details to customer care and they say 's ieze all contact with this person and that he / she is a known scammer and that i should contact IRS In case you are wondering how it works the check is a fake however the banks here make the balance available as soon as you deposit it Now if you withdraw money from your account immediately which according to you is already there and give it to the nice lady mentioned above then when the bank finds out the check is a frod you are indebted and you are labelled as a check frod and your account is sealed not to mention your credit history is screwed royally you would almost never again get a loan or a credit card or rent a car or a house or anything else I got a check for 5430 when i asked for 1000 first month rent and deposit you do the math PS be safe be careful peace all these statements cannot help you PPS in case they do be safe be careful 
Long has mankind battled and suffered demons within and demons without Demons of their own creation sometimes in the name of war sometimes in the name of recreation sometimes by an insatiable lust for power and other times for wealth men or women How can this list exclude battles for honour Indeed it cannot It does not Demons unleashed by forces beyond our comprehenshion storms that rip apart a mans life and storms that decimate the collective life of mankind I have spoken of war now in a generic sense for I wish to deal with the specific in the context of the generic Long are the hours that I have spent decrying that mankinds fundamental nature is evil and chaotic and yet my heart tells me to keep faith that mankind is true and good Reality often lies between the extremes of our rosiest dreams and our worst nightmares And so again has human nature continued to remain fickle and dynamic eluding all attempts to classify it as good or bad Indeed now an attempt for such a classification seems naive 
Oprah Needs More Social MARCH 18 2010 3 COMMENTS AND 82 REACTIONS I was interviewed by Derrick Ashong from Oprah Radio part of the Oprah Winfrey Network He was smart personable fast-moving and definitely a great person for this space The experience left me thinking about how FastCompany magazine said that Ashton Kutcher is the new one to watch on the salvation of media and entertainment To me the potential savior list looks a bit different * Oprah * Jon Stewart * Conan ( especially if he doesn t go to Fox ) * Rick Sanchez from CNN ( from the news perspective ) To me the thing they re all missing is a deeper integration to social media tools for two-way conversations for a deeper sense of loyalty and connectedness Jimmy Fallon does that stuff reasonably well but then his show isn t all that interesting to me He 's got the social thing figured out a bit better but the payload isn t there Derrick Ashong the guy who interviewed me from Oprah Radio made a good moving coming out to South by Southwest because he showed in that gesture that he knew where the stories were that he could get information from the ground-level stuff that we all uncover and that he was there to learn as much as he was there to pluck stories from the air I think what 's next for media and entertainment will be a hybrid not a fast shift away But I think it will also be gatekeeper-free 
When I list the HiDef profile as requiring a DirectX 10 GPU on Windows I don t mean that XNA Game Studio 4 0 uses DirectX 10 or 11 It does not our Windows framework is implemented using DirectX 9 But the HiDef profile requires a GPU with roughly Xbox 360 level capabilities MRT floating point surface formats vertex texture fetch etc These are optional caps in DirectX 9 but we need them all to support HiDef ( think of it as DirectX 9 turned up to 11 ) In theory it is possible that a DirectX 9 GPU could support all these caps just like every DirectX 10 GPU exposes them all when we access it via the DirectX 9 API but in practice I know of no such DirectX 9 chip Rather than confusing everybody by saying HiDef requires this complex set of caps it is easier to simplify this to just HiDef requires a DirectX 10 GPU A nice benefit of accessing DirectX 10 hardware via the DirectX 9 API is this means HiDef games can run on Windows XP as well as Vista and Win7 You will notice that rendertarget format support is still allowed to vary There were just too many differences in format support for us to successfully standardize this We have a caps API for querying what formats are available but more importantly we have a built-in fallback mechanism The format parameters used when creating rendertargets and backbuffers have changed from format to preferredFormat We will try to give you the exact format you asked for but if that is not supported we will automatically fall back to the closest possible match looking for a format with similar bit depth number of channels etc 
I have read many books and novels in which the phrase home away from home has come I had always thought that I have never experienced that feeling and was wondering whether I will ever get that feeling For the past 5 days I have got that feeling I am at the US right now studying at North Carolina State University I had come down from India on august 20th itself to go to my aunts place at Atlanta There they are a typical Indian tamil family There all the time they speak tamil and every day its Indian food This gave me the atmosphere of being at home I was thinking all this will go off once I go to my apartments at my university I came to Raleigh ( where my university is located ) 5 days back I was thinking I am going to feel lonely To my surprise near my apartments itself there were many Indians who were very friendly However there were two main reasons why I did not feel lonely 
Excess - There is an old saying in sanskrit Ati sarwagya warjyate That means excess of anything is bad We can handle things in two ways one is using it and another is misusing it Nuclear reactions can be used for getting power ( electricity ) and also can be used in nuclear bombs One of my friend had some disease in which he was growing thinner Doctor suggested him to drink beer 3 teaspoons daily Then for 5 years he drunk beer which gave him no harm Medicines have alcohol in them for removing illness But alcohol taken in EXCESS is injurious to health These things were created or invented for some good reason but everything depends in the way we are using it Sugar ( glucose ) is meant for getting instant energy but excess of it can cause diabetes Excess of everything is bad Teasing a friend in front of all other friend for fun is good and grow relations closer but excess of teasing can make the person angry and can break friendship Excess of gaming sleeping talking and even studying are also not good Sometimes excess of love is also not good )] After a long time when I went to my home my mom fed me with all the stuffs which she knew I like I was trying to control myself but as love was involved in it so I couldn t say NO and ate everything And at last I vomited all of it out Then she realised its excess 
Introduction This whole blog is dedicated to my friend Tilesh Carefully read the lines below 1 Names in this blog have been changed to conserve privacy ( except Tilesh 's ) 2 This blog is allowed to be read by Tilesh and his friend and my college friends and specially not allowed to my school friends 3 This is going to be totally mine ( my novel )( first person view ) so it can be a bit boring sometimes As Tilesh has requested several times to me to write story of our 3 yrs in Kota so i m forced to write this Once upon a time long long ago I became 15 yrs old My life became a bit interesting My b day comes on February I was in 10th class in 2003 We had a new principal I think she hardly knew names of the students I wasn t so popular student It was the time of board exams We had preparation leave But I came to school to pick up my sister I was out of the gate of school as they do not allow any student to enter the school campus after assembly gets over I was arguing with guard at the gate outside another guard came from inside and told me principal ma am is calling me I thought i should have not argued with this guard When I went inside principal 's room ( first time after getting admission ) the principal was smiling she asked you are Abhyuday naa I replied yes ma am and then she congratulated me and told me that I got a maths olympiad certificate 1st in Jabalpur region (32 schools comes under the region ) and 36th in India This is the first good thing happened to me AFTER 15 Second I dropped a girl ( my sister 's friend ) in my bike from my home to her home who was considered as the most beautiful girl in my school by my school friends She is married now And so on now coming to the main topic My father was very much impressed by his boss son who went to Kota for preparing engineering entrance examinations who was 1yr senior to me He wanted me to go to Kota for preparing for my future He never told me to go to Kota but I knew he want me to Many of my senior from my school also went to Kota I heard that they teach only maths and science ( my favourite subjects ) no social studies hindi enlish ( i hated them ) So deep in my heart I also wanted to go to Kota So after my board exams and after watching the cricket worldcup ( in which India came to final after 20 yrs ) we ( mom dad sister and another family ) went for south tourism It was a one month tour It was from SHIRDI AURANGABAAD HUMPI B LORE MYSORE MADURAI KODAIKANAL KANYAKUMARI RAMESHWARAM CHENNAI TIRUPATI NAGPUR to SEONI I had never gone outside M P before After long trip I forgot all the things about going to Kota and all No one remembered about it then After coming from the trip with my mom and sis I went to my maternal grand parents REWA Things were changed after coming from the trip There wasn t a single day when my mom and dad didn t have a quarrel and those fights weren t small they were horrible I had never seen my mom and dad like that In REWA ( my grand parent 's home ) there were 2 cousins of my age Anand and Nandani were in 10th class too They got 84 and 80 % marks nowhere comparison to me (64%) But I got good marks in my favorite subjects (96 in maths and 87 in science ) They had begun to study for the 11th class I never told them my score but my dad did and they never mentioned it so that I don t feel bad They asked me what am I gonna do I told them I m going to Kota Anand asked me which institute I was answerless Never heard of it I just heard that for preparing for EEEs many people have went to Kota thats all Then he told me there are 3 good institutes TCPP RESTART BACHELOR among them BACHELOR is better then RESTART and then TCPP My father called me and asked me that do I want to go to Kota I already wanted to go but now I was dying to I don t wanna see their ( mom 's and dad 's ) fights I thought if I go they ll not have time to fight My father then asked me to get ready for it as tomorrow I ll have to leave REWA I wanted to go but didn t want to leave so soon So I intentionally slept for long my grandfather guessed it woke me up and send me to SHAHDOL (6 hrs journey from REWA by bus ) with another guy just to drop off me 6 hrs just to drop off I am considered as a small child Still now also if I tell them that I travel alone for 2 days in a train no one there would believe me From there my father took me to BHOPAL he had some work there We reached there in the morning 6 a m after a long journey of 15 hrs It was my sister 's b day I wasn t ever away from her on her b day Father called her and wished her then i did We stayed for the day in my uncle 's ( mother 's brother ) home Then we had waiting list reservation for BHOPAL to Kota train that was late at night 10 p m waiting list never confirmed I spent that night sitting Morning 5 a m we reached there Kota what I imagined about kota was there will be big desert in which there will be just 4 or 5 houses in each square kilometers it will be too hot At least one thing I expected was correct it was really very hot At 9 a m we went to BACHELOR one manager told that its too late at 9 a m they are having entrance test For engineering entrance examination we ll have to give entrance examination for this also My father shown my 96 and 87 marks list The manager tol dit ll now help you go try somewhere else Then with all mood off we went to RESTART there they told that they have exam today at 2 p m For writing exams we ll have to fill a form for filling it we ll need to have passport size photos of me so there should be some one who can give photos within an hour we searched and got one After filling form and having lunch I went to give exam 3 hrs paper after a 6hrs bus journey then a night train journey then a night waiting list journey then this exam I was really very exhausted Anyways while I was writing the exam my father was exploring the Kota After exam he took me to Chambal garden best place in Kota then he told me about the places I can go in Kota for a mood refreshment if I have studied too much Then by a train at night we came back we never went to TCPP Result was dated to come after 2 days We came back to SHAHDOL and my mom came back from REWA to pack up my luggage After 2 days of rest in home the time to go to Kota came father called an autorikhshaw I was sitting in it with full luggage my mother came and gave me a water bottle I saw her she had 2-2 tears in each of her eyes I said 'm om she su enly went inside pretending as if she didn t hear me My dad also saw this while in a way to Kota he was a type of consoling me you are not going forever you ll be back here within 2 yrs your mom doesn t understand but you do I know you do anyways you ll often visit us in vacations 4 yrs after this my aunt ( mom 's sister ) told me that when I went to Kota for 3 days my mom did nothing she didn t had lunch and dinner either my sister cooked food for 3 days and served to my mom but she didn t had My mom ate food when my sister told her that if you are not having food then I ll also not have it Anyways coming back to Kota I didn t get selected in RESTART as I told you the exam I gave was in fully exhausted mood Father did the same thing shown my 64 % mark list but it didn t work again But it worked in TCPP they allowed me to join there institute just by purchasing their form Someone told there that there is another good institute better than TCPP called NARNIA My father was in dilemma but I wasn t Nobody in SHAHDOL or REWA knows this NARNIA but they do know TCPP let NARNIA be better than TCPP but if I join TCPP I ll have something to tell them but if I join NARNIA I ll have nothing So at last I selected TCPP as a better carrier option we went to TCPP 's building to have admission there I found Rahul rest in another post 
The most common complaint and comment about an Automatic tranmission car is that You have less control over it there is less involvement compared to a manual transmission car Agreed you can t dictate the car to change to any gear that you please when you have an automatic transmission but from my experience I can tell you if you know your know your car well enough and if you are able to feel what it is doing you can make even an automatic transmission car do whatever you please ( well almost ) First of all it 's possible due to the fact that most engine management system of today 's cars are intelligent and are based on a feedback system The car does n t just do pre-programmed actions irrespective of anything anymore but on the contrary listens to the driver input tries to gauge the intention of the driver and tries to act accordingly producing wonderful results almost always Next is your talent how much you know your car and can undestand what it 's trying to tell you 
MASKS Wherever I go I see masks around me I don t see real people walking down the streets and lanes I see masks Different shapes and colors and sizes but only masks no real people A smile over here and a grimace there some tears and some anger some doubt and some happiness all masks though no real people at all And then I question myself Is it not possible for any human being to be the real himself without the mask I think I know the answer and I don t want to know it at all Since there is no one who is totally like you ( head and heart soul and thought ) there can be no time when you can be the true you It is often said and written down in desolate blogs like these that people need to be real and true but it is not possible There are certain aspects of each of us which need to be hi en from someone or the other This way each of us carry the burden of masks all our lives the difference is that some know it and some are just too happy with everything around them and choose to ignore it I have two important questions to ask 1 Do we ever have regret for wearing the masks Does is ever bother us to see the world through masks and compelling the others to see you through the same filter 2 What happens to two people who are exactly the same ( monozygotic twins ) People with even the same DNA structures have a very strong bond and are virtually the same person in most of the situations What would happen to such people ( I don t know ) 
The Difference Between Recipe and Restaurant MARCH 17 2010 46 COMMENTS AND 137 REACTIONS I have intent on the brain So does Tim Sanders it turns out During my speech at the first ever GR2L event ( get ready to live ) I talked about shifting from connections into intent I was talking about networking at that juncture I want to expand And I have a comparison / analogy to light this up The difference between talking about human business and social media and doing it is the difference between having recipes and running a restaurant We go to events and network We collect business cards Why Because we don t know what else to do We know we re supposed to network We talk about why it 's important The thing is what do we DO with these Jon Swanson wrote about switching back to a dumb phone when he realized that he didn t really have to check email and Twitter every waking hour Jon 's restaurant doesn t need an always-on recipe See it Intent and Execution are the gold standard My friend ( I 'm calling us friends ) Tom Peters has spent decades on the variation of the theme that execution is everything He pushes us over and over again to DO Because again Tom knows that having a box of recipes is nothing compared to executing on them and putting food down in front of people Tom urges us to look at the buying trends in the world and realize that Baby Boomers and Women should be our main markets ( in most cases ) Tom 's restaurant caters to those crowds quite well Are you doing the same Open With a Few Dishes Having a huge recipe box of ideas is one thing Starting a restaurant and seeing what your guests like is another We re all in this space picking up ideas We go to big events we read tons of books we surf hundreds of blogs but if we re not trying a few of these recipes out we re not really moving forward We re thinking plenty more than we re doing What recipes should you start on today ( Here 's a hint pick just a few or one and learn to make it so that your guests sing ) I Believe This is a BIG Thing I think we have to accept that we have a big enough recipe box I think we have to look at what kind of restaurant we want to run what kind of guest we hope to attract what kind of cost-per-dish we re aiming for and what kind of experience we want people to have and then we have to DO Will you take a moment and talk about your restaurant I know I 'm hungry

Is Rome A Safe City To Visit That 's a bizarre question and the obvious answer is that it 's as safe-- or unsafe-- as New York or London or Paris or Chicago or Bangkok or L A No doubt if you look hard enough you can find trouble anywhere I only even bring it up because in Rick Steves Rome 2010 he inexplicably seems to dwell on all the misery that can befall a hapless tourist at the hands of Romans determined to ruin everyone 's good time I guess he 's just doing his due diligence when he warns his readers that w ith sweet-talking con artists meeting you at the station well-dressed pickpockets on buses and thieving gangs of children at the ancient sites Rome is a gauntlet of rip-offs While it is nowhere near as bad as it was a few years ago and pickpockets don t want to hurt you-- they usually just want your money-- green or sloppy tourists will be scammed Thieves strike when you re distracted Don t trust kind strangers Keep nothing important in your pockets Be most on guard wen boarding and leaving buses and subways Thieves crowd the door then stop and turn while others crowd and push from behind The sneakiest thieves are well-dressed businessmen ( generally with something in their hands ) lately many are posing as tourists with fanny packs cameras and even Rick Steves guidebooks Scams abound Jesus he makes it sound like hell and especially singles out groups of city-stained children ( just 8-10 years old-- too young to be prosecuted but old enough to rip you off ) troll though the tourist crowds around the Colosseum Forum Piazza della Republica and train and Metro stations Jeepers that 's my neighborhood In fact I spent the day walking around the Colosseum Forum Victor Emmanuel Monument Capitoline Hill conveniently the smallest of the 7 hills of Rome Maybe the gangs of trolling 8-10 year olds only come out in summer Winter is cold in Rome There were few tourists and no marauding bands of banditos I ve felt safe from the moment I arrived I 'm staying in a flat in an old palace Palazzo del Grillo built in the 1600s I 'm sitting at my desk on my new MacBook Air and right out the window literally spitting distance are the fenced in remote ruins at the back of the Forum ( Foro di Nerva I believe ) It 's an amazing juxtaposition If there are ghosts-- and I 'm sure there are-- they are friendly or at least pacific The vibe is tranquil and safe The neighborhood Monti is slightly off the beaten track-- the other side of the Forum being where all the action is and all the crowds In ancient days it was a crowded home to thousands of poor people and brothels Now the cobbled winding streets have a special charm slightly removed from the hectic turmoil of the city around it A couple of nights ago I went for a walk the other night and ran across a street party dozens of people in the street in front of what turned out to be a gallery Someone invited me in and I was astounded by the exhibition hundreds of mounted photographs that told the history of Monti from the late 1800 's to the present I spent hours marveling at how the area had changed-- and how it hadn t There were even pictures of Mussolini and his black-shirted cohorts walking the same streets I was on If there is any sense of danger at all it 's that the drivers are all-- every single one of them-- talking sometimes quite animatedly-- on cell phones or texting The traffic seems deadly although when I got out in it today I noticed that everyone takes care not to hit anyone and they do slow down if you walk boldly into a crosswalk and stare at them As for violence well Berlusconi got slammed in the face with a statuette in Milano not Roma-- and everyone knows how much the Milanese hate Rome the Romans and the central government I found an organic grocery store not far and went shopping and I ve mostly been eating in while I kick my jet lag and wait for my lost / supposedly found luggage But last night when I was making my way around Monti I dropped in to a restaurant that is supposed to be impossible without reservations F I S H Fine International Seafood House Indicative of the season it was nearly empty and I 'm getting the idea that everything that usually hard to get into from the forbi ing lines at the Vatican to La Pergola on the roof of the Cavalieri Hilton Anyway F I S H was very hip and chic with groovy music and an interesting seafood menu that mostly tended towards the pan-Asian I had a cream of zucchini soup that fantastic followed by a delicately curried tandoor sea bass that I can t get out of my mind 20 hours later After the above bravado about how easy it will be to get into La Pergola I decided to call and make a reservation for about two weeks from now-- fulled booked then and every day before then Tomorrow I ll be braving the lines at the Vatican at 8 30AM 
I lost my identity yesterday Along with that I lost the right to drive ( both in India and in the US ) I also lost the right to spend money without having any ( I believe that 's possible through the use of something called Credit Cards ) If I ever happen to be jobless in the United States I have also lost the right to social security I lost my wallet It could have been pickpocketed It could have just dropped out of my back pocket It could have been zapped out of existence by a recital of Vogon Poetry My credit cards could have been used to purchase blood diamonds Or worse still Barbie dolls Perhaps even Himesh Reshammiyya 's greatest hits CD The horrific possibilities are endless I would now need to pay a little more than the usual bribe to the cop who catches me using my cellphone while I am overtaking a water tanker from the wrong side of the road at 80 kmph All because my driving license is now possibly being used to create fake IDs for suicide bombers Perhaps I should not have written my ATM pin number on the backside of my debit card These are interesting times To cancel my credit card ABN Amro wanted me to reconfirm my waist size and the length ( in millimetres ) of my left hand 's index finger Security they say 
Of course we cannot establish whether God exists But we can certainly observe human societies all over the world and periods for which historical records are available I would suggest that we observe the following 1 The percentage of believers and their strength of belief 2 Individual experience of spiritual ecstasy 3 The impact of faith on the material and mental well being of humans 4 The impact of faith on morality and righteousness and justice Perhaps you can come up with more similar points which would lend themselves to careful systematic accurate objective observation I think any such observation will lead us to the conclusion that majority of people in any society anywhere at any time have been strong believers and such belief has made it possible for the societies to run with equity and justice and individuals have been better off mentally and materially I am sure that one will come across atrocities and cruelties in the name of religion I think overall the positive factors will prevail I believe survival of fittest would operate here also and faith survives proving that in general the gains are more than the losses

DREAMERS OF DAY Designers are an o lot creative moody pensive thoughtful weird But the one characteristic that separates designers from others is action They make stuff that didn t exist before They take the idea living deep inside their head and pull it out realizing it in a drawing prototype or product Unlike most people they don t just think about it They don t just brainstorm They don t just imagine something better and then talk themselves out of it Instead they act They are in the words of T E Lawrence dreamers of day All men dream but not equally Those who dream by night in the dusty recesses of their minds Awake to find that it was vanity But the dreamers of day are dangerous men That they may act their dreams with open eyes to make it possible T E Lawrence ( aka Lawrence of Arabia ) FEBRUARY 5 2010 by JOSHUA PORTER TAGS week 5 WEEK 04 CONSTRAINTS FUEL CREATIVITY We are often led to believe that the more freedom we have the more creative we will be Full creative license Sweet Unlimited budget Awesome No timetable Even better Yeah right I say embrace your constraints and draw out of them the very solution that sets you apart from the crowd The imposition of constraints can lead to great design decisions Limitations often force you to view things from a perspective you are not accustomed to and in turn can stimulate the clarity and purpose of the design rather than debilitate and hinder your creative process One of the most obvious and currently talked about examples is the iPhone ( and as of yesterday the iPad ) There are incredible limitations with such a device So many that people initially speculated it would be a massive failure However the team at Apple truly embodies this ethos Despite physical constraints technological constraints time constraints and of course the Steve constraint the team was able to unlock innovative solutions that allowed them to create something truly unique Are there problems with the iPhone Yes Of course there are The point is if you want to create a truly compelling experience don t complain about your constraints embrace them And in doing so set your creativity on fire 
Verbose vs heap-dump I have always shown people verbose that is the way the heap is utilized when threads are acting on application You have good tools to read verbose file generated by servers and plot it for better UI ( I prefer IBM PMAT pattern modelling and analysis tool ) A more intelligent set of people ( esp in java ) will not be all happy with this only They would ask Which objects are there in heap Verbose has no answer A Heap-dump would be having the answer The heap dump refers to a file ( hprof or txt or phd file ) that CAN be collected during the application-run This is 's top-the-world and lengthy process and it will force JVM for compaction also that means its not a thing to trigger every 10 minutes although it can be ( For some servers this has to be enabled before starting the server ) A heap dump obtained is a big file with cryptographic data present in it if opened in simple text editors This can be read here but beyond my scope at this point This has to be opened by specialized tool for reading heapDumps ( like M 4J IBM-HeapDumpAnalyzer Eclipse MAT --The best so far I found ) Once opened you will find a lot of object names present at heap when the snapshot was taken The UI will show number of each objects size of each object Thats ok The best thing it has is the chain Not all objects are created directly by the programmer And once the class unloads all its objects are cleared great No Some objects due to bad coding remains forever Example Cache Objects ( implemented without soft referencing ) Other important object that stays in heap are due to big architectural dependencies these are the objects like Connection which gets created from a pool ( usually ) and is binded to various objects something like Driver / Factory binding so basically some object (s ay A ) is created by B (d irectly ) and registered by C ( indirectly like binding ) As B unloads A remains in the heap as it has reference ( C ) living that will kill automatic cleaning up feature of JVM There can be various other things available for keeping the object alive The worst part is in a heap you cant find the age of the object ( I couldn t ) Each big object (s ize wise and number wise ) must be traversed to its dominator (p arent object ) to catch the leak leak yes all the time B loads it creates A and A A A and we have a lot of A 's in heap (s ince C is something that HAS to be on heap and it holds ref to A 's ) and one day our Java code will throw OutOfMemoryException yes thats like loop forever and create new Object in a loop God gifted quality of bad coding practices can lead to disaster this is not functional defect This is quality defect The code is perfect if code just means giving desired output Yes it gives desired output but may fail to do so forever and absolutely not when concurrently accessed by million users forever To find these errors we cant go through code and find defect Not possible We might find practice to be perfect but results are disastrous so ONLY one hope HEAP dear coders please start reading heap I am doing these nowadays Once I get more info I ll share thanks ZeeK 
The Ultimate Guide To Not Caring and Being Awesome Today 's guest post is from Diggy at Upgrade Reality where he talks about self improvement and personal growth I had to post this guide because it gave me a chuckle especially in the context of long-term travel if you do care what other people think you ll suffer immeasurably There 's nothing more humbling than travel and while from the outside it may seem like we re all free-wheeling adventurers there is an inherent process to getting there Not caring and being awesome is a learned skill Now on to the awesomeness Are you one of those people who really cares what other people think of them to such a degree that it influences almost every decision you make I have met some people who based every decision they made on trying to get other people to like them They would buy fashionable brand-name clothes because it was trendy and should impress others They would live in an expensive apartment because it should impress people They would drive an expensive car because it should impress people They would smoke because it was cool Caring vs Not Caring Let 's take an example of two guys Guy A does everything with the sole intention to try to impress people He drives an expensive car to look cool wears expensive clothes to be classy buys people drinks to look generous smokes to look cool tells stories about all his cool ( and fake ) adventures Guy B doesn t care much what people think about him He has his own mission and his own likes and dislikes If he doesn t like something he won t do it or he will simply say no He is one of those guys who may just show up at a black tie event in shorts and sandals because he was in the area and wanted to see his friends He will go and dance on an empty dancefloor in a busy club because his favorite song is on and he doesn t want to wait for others to start dancing before he can have fun He will be the first one to open his mouth when something isn t right while other people just wait in line and don t say anything While guy A may initially seem cool he is fake Nothing about him is real Once people discover this about him they will likely lose respect for him very quickly and all his efforts of trying to impress people actually lead to people disliking him There is nothing likable about people who are deceptive and unauthentic The chances for people to like the guy B are actually pretty high although he totally doesn t set out to be liked by people He is happy with who he is he has boundaries and he sticks to his principles Sometimes he may be perceived as a bit of a social idiot with no manners ( like showing up at a black tie event in shorts and sandals ) and there are people that will not like him for that However many people will actually like him and respect him for having such a strong identity and for having his own boundaries because it is something that many other people do not have He is real and will not sell himself out just to impress other people This is a cool little graph that shows the effect of caring what people think about you on how people actually think of you The more you care what people think of you the less likely you are perceived to be a cool person The less you care what people think of you and the more you do your own thing and have a strong sense of your own identity the more people will think you are totally awesome Who do you want to be like The person who bases every decision on trying to impress others or the person who is on their own mission and happy with who they are Not Caring vs Being Stupid There is a big difference between not caring and being stupid The reason why I am telling you this is because I don t want you to read this article and think Hey Diggy says I shouldn t care what people think and then go up to the first police officer you see and start swearing at him and calling him a fat doughnut-eating pig That is not the idea behind not caring what other people think that is being plain stupid because it WILL get you arrested Not caring about what people think means not basing your decisions on what people will think of you You do something because it is what YOU want to do or it is a part of your goals or mission If you are in a great mood and feel like doing a cartwheel on the street then just do it If you think an outfit looks really nice don t worry about if others will like it or not If you have something you want to share with the world don t be too scared to stand up and tell people about it just because it is possible that they will laugh at you I think that by now you understand what I am trying to say How To Not Care Okay this is what you have been waiting for the entire article How to not care what other people think of you It is one thing so say Ahh I don t really care what people think but it is another story to actually not care what other people think How do you go about adopting the habit of not being affected by how other people will think of you ( especially when you have conditioned yourself for years to base your actions on impressing people ) First it is going to take time You will not be able to change yourself overnight and probably not within a week either It is going to to take you conscious effort for a few weeks or even a few months before you can really and truly not care about what others think of you or your actions People don t like you because of what you buy and what you have they like you for who you are and what you are (T here are unfortunately always people who will pretend to be your friend for their own personal gain These are not the kind of people who you want to like you anyways ) This is something I am telling you from experience and even though you may take what I say to heart you will still have to realize it for yourself I cannot do that for you Secondly you are going to feel awkward The only way to really not care about what people think means you have to start doing what you want in the situations where you normally change your behavior to impress other people Initially this is going to feel awkward to you You might feel humiliated stupid or embarrased It doesn t matter it 's part of the process and it won t kill you I used to be the guy who cared a lot about what other people thought I used to want gadgets clothes and cars to impress people I used to think if I just went along with other people I would fit in and they would like me It took me a good 3 years to get to my current stage where I care little about what other people think of how I live my life Where it started for me is being really shy to approach attractive girls I would be scared to go over and talk to her because of what she might think of me And if she didn t want to talk to me I would be scared to be humiliated in front of other people Like I said it took me a long time to change my thought process and not care anymore what people think about me The only way to change it was lots of experiences forcing myself to go up to attractive girls and just saying the first thing that came to mind ( which was often something ridiculously stupid ) It took me a long time to realize that it doesn t matter It doesn t matter what people think of you when you do something It doesn t matter if you do something cool or something stupid Most people don t even know you and will never see you again So what if you do something stupid and people around you think that you are a moron for a few hours They probably won t even pay attention to you for more than a few minutes Do you remember someone who made a complete fool out of themselves last week or last month or last year Maybe you can think of one or two people but other than that you probably can t even though there were hundreds of people around you who felt that they did something stupid or who felt embarrassed about what other people would think about them Parting Words The most clear and simple instruction that I can teach you how not to care about what people think of you is this Whenever you do something ask yourself Am I doing this to impress other people and because I hope to be liked by others or am I doing this for myself If the HONEST answer to the above question is that you are doing something to impress others and you wouldn t really do it otherwise then don t do it Do things because they are part of your mission your goal or because they amuse you Remember it doesn t matter what the people in the restaurant think of you or what the group of girls at the club think of you or what the people who view your Youtube videos think of you

After feeling like a castaway due to spending a few weeks on a secluded beach in Mexico I awoke one day with an idea of walking the entire bay and picking up trash The strange bit of this adventure was the amount of shoes that I found It was interesting that I never came across pairs only a single lone shoe missing its twin After collection two grocery bags full I thought it would be a good idea to make them into some form of art before I threw them into the garbage Mimicking the palm leaf shapes casting shadows on the ground I ordered the shoes largest to smallest creating my found object art piece Here 's the photo of my work I 'm still a bit bewildered by how many shoes are washed up on shore when compared to other trash items I think that this provides a bit of a lesson to all of us Please check your shoes to be sure they are a snug fit or leave them with your towel The ocean has a way of taking them and never giving them back 
I had a very pleasant discussion that night about the significance of Mary in terms of my early childhood I was born in 1970 to parents who were to some extent limited by being the first in their respective families to aspire to a university education and having both ventured outside the UK to practise their teaching I think they were confident professionally but less so in other areas of their lives They d have liked to have been hippies but were too responsible to be properly bohemian They made an effort though I grew up amid brown-painted walls cane furniture ostrich and peacock feathers ( although this was a fairly brief trend ) and my mother wafting around in maxi-dresses sometimes risking the faintest hint of patchouli Musically my abiding memory of long car journeys is a mixed bag Carpenters Beach Boys Simon Garfunkel Boney M 
As I parked the car and started carrying him into the hospital my stomach was full of butterflies and my head was full of paranoia Not paranoid thoughts just pure plain head splitting paranoia I seemed to be visiting this place so often that I should get a season ticket I 'm sure the Security Guard no ed with a frown of recognition and I still had to face the receptionist I tried to calm myself down as I answered her numerous questions told myself I was being stupid I couldn t see her screen but I could imagine it now showing all of our details all our numerous visits I know I 'm a good loving parent I do believe in a smacked bum but I don t believe in beating a child I needed to stop panicking it would all be fine Was you alone in the house with the child when the incident happened This one brought me up short Would they have asked a woman that question When did the accident become an incident I guess I should be thankful that she referred to him as the child and not the victim I bit my tongue and gave neither a smart arse nor a stinging retort just a feeble Yes I think I just made myself look more guilty her eyes have changed I 'm sure of it Maybe I should be getting angry with the delay but I know they re only doing their job But one of their jobs is flushing out child abusers and did I now look like one 
If anyone was looking for a self-righteous extreme feminist they found one in Angie Jackson This is a woman who was so proud she was aborting her baby that she announced she would tweet her chemical-cocktail abortion live as it happened on Twitter The liberal media found this made-for-TV slaughter fascinating and not at all a controversy worthy of discussing with two sides Newsweek 's Sarah Kliff proclaimed :\ One hundred thousand people have watched Angie Jackson 's abortion Late last month Jackson posted a video of herself to YouTube recorded after she took RU-486 a medication used to end pregnancies Kliff asked only why shame remains about the act of killing one 's baby Jackson was honored for her courage in demystifying and destigmatizing the procedure :\ We need 10 000 more of her proclaimed Peg Johnston chair of something called the Abortion Care Network This desire for 10 000 more unashamed abortions is what pro-choice is all about Overall this was just another classic tale from the news 'm agazine that lamented 20 years ago that Sadly many home abortion remedies could damage a fetus instead of kill it What about the pro-life side Read more http // newsbusters org / blogs / brent-bozell /2010/03/10/ bozell-column-shameless-abortion-carnival ixzz0iPK9N1ID 
Tomorrow the FCC will release a national broadband strategy The plan will set goals for expanding broadband to unserved and under-served areas promote greater speeds and drive consumer demand It will harness this communications technology to urgent national priorities such as jobs education health energy and security In short the plan will lay the groundwork for investing in America 's future Yes the Internet was invented in the United States Yes we once led the world in broadband development But now networks in many countries from Western Europe to East Asia are faster and more advanced than our own Long after we recover from this recession this broadband gap will be a dead weight on American businesses and workers unless we act now As with the space race in the 1960s America needs a national effort by our scientists engineers companies educational institutions and government agencies Just like that great national adventure we need near-term and long-term goals Broadband is an essential input to expanding business education and healthcare opportunities everywhere As soon as possible we need to bring Internet access to every community from rural America to the inner cities But we also need even more ambitious objectives or 's tretch goals that test the limits of our ingenuity When President John F Kennedy summoned the nation to space exploration the immediate goal was to send an astronaut in orbit around the earth But JFK called for putting a man on the moon because he knew that dream would inspire Americans to literally reach for the stars The private sector has a big job to do and needs to carry much of the investment For our part we plan to build and test an ultra-high-speed broadband network in at least one U S community We are excited by the amount of support our proposed testbed has received from local communities and individuals But smart tailored public policies are critical too Let 's install broadband fiber as part of every federally-funded infrastructure project from highways to mass transit And let 's deploy broadband fiber to every library school community health center and public housing facility in the U S I support a national broadband strategy because ubiquitous broadband connectivity can catapult America into the next level of economic competitiveness worker productivity and educational opportunity But as in the past we will make this breakthrough by choice not chance

This afternoon at SXSW a panel of Gmail and Google Buzz team members took part in a panel where they discussed what goes on behind the scenes at Gmail The panel covered a smattering of topics covering everything from Gmail stickers to site speed but eventually the discussion turned to the elephant in the room Google Buzz 's privacy shortcomings when it launched last month Google Product Manager To Jackson said that Google had learned a lot from the incident acknowledging that Google was in error when it made the assumption that users wanted to move their email and chat contacts over to their Buzz social graph and auto-followed them To make sure that kind of blunder doesn t happen again he revealed that Google may start pre-releasing new Buzz features to small subsets of users So why exactly did Google Buzz launch with some key social features missing Jackson said that while Google employees were testing out the product internally they never had much desire to mute any of their coworkers and that their email contact list closely matched the people they wanted to follow on Buzz Obviously that wasn t true for most people once the product was released outside of the Googleplex Which is why Google is considering pre-releasing new Buzz features to a few thousand opt-in users long before they re rolled out to the public That would stand in contrast to what Google does for many of its major product launches as Jackson says that the company doesn t like to preannounce things ( it frustrates users when they can t try the new release out for themselves ) But in the case of Buzz where changes can have a major impact with respect to user privacy it sounds like Google may be making an exception Jackson also noted that he had actually asked SXSW speaker danah boyd to give her keynote talk on privacy and publicity at Google headquarters 
For most of the world today is March 14th or 3 /14 To most that date doesn t have any special meaning But to us math nerds it means only one thing today is Pi Day Thankfully it looks like Google has no shortage of number nerds because the search giant is marking the occasion with a spiffy new logo filled with some of choice geometry formulas (P i ) is the mathematical constant that has helped school children and mathematics professors determine the circumference of a circle based on its diameter for centuries The constant starts with 3 14 and continues forever ( as it is an irrational number ) Many math geeks celebrate the famous math constant ( and mathematics in general ) on every 14th of March because that date represents the first three digits of Pi Google 's ( Google ) new logo which you can see on the top right contains not only the famous r2 formula but five other uses of measuring the volume of a sphere (V = 4 3 r3 ) computing the circumference of a circle ( C = 2 r ) measuring the volume of a cylinder (V = r2h ) Archimedes calculation of Pi (223/71 22 /7) and the periodic function of sin (x) As a former physics major and long-time math nerd I love Pi Day and I am very happy that Google not only celebrated the occasion but created such an intricate logo to mark this day Almost everyone worldwide will see this logo it 's Mothers Day in the UK ( the fourth Sunday of Lent ) and thus they have their own logo to celebrate it which we have included below How will you celebrate Pi Day Please let us know in the comments 
Tonight the new season of The Celebrity Apprentice premiered Video of the episode 's two standout moments in which Rod Blagojevich was caught in a lie and Donald Trump argued with Cyndi Lauper about how disgusting Rosie O Donnell is is inside The premiere episode 's challenge saw the two teams ( once again it 's men vs women ) operating diners in an attempt to raise money for the chosen charity of their project managers Joan Rivers winner of the show 's last season stopped by both and gave her critiques to Trump Apparently Rivers was less than impressed with the men 's team citing Blagojevich 's chatty nature as the reason her burger took nearly 10 minutes to get from the kitchen (p ost-completion ) to the table When asked about this Blagojevich immediately put on his politician hat and issued the age-old I don t recall defense

Two months ago Google threatened to shut down its China search engine over censorship Yet until today its China search engine has stayed up with results still censored Now the search company is finally expected to announce that it 's going to actually follow through and slowly shut down its China search engine So why does it feel like Google 's ( Google ) impending decision will not have the impact it could have had two months ago When Google first made its declaration the implications seemed enormous One of the world 's largest technology companies was reigniting the censorship debate Governments and activists would query China over the Google attacks and the state of free speech in its country while Google would be taking the moral high ground as it walked away from one of the world 's largest markets due to principle Instead we ve had a two month will they or won t they type of affair that even Google 's co-founder said could take a year or two to resolve Now that the end game may be close what will happen when Google actually pulls out of the world 's most populated nation The answer sadly is not much

we are most wonderful in our own stride Even the weakest link is the strongest one We just have to believe that God has made us in a way that we all form keys of a massive lock that needs to be adjusted formed in proper combination and then run through for unlocking the mystery So today take a chance decide and go for it you will win just believe that you will and the beliefs will follow you Just take a step to target and the roads will move you trust me to trust yourself and the God will trust you and he like me like you will hit the target and make it worth we are what we are and we are all the best 
Immediately following his well-attended GDC panel Nintendo 's Yoshio Sakamoto talked with us about ( what else ) Metroid Other M In a ition to all sorts of questions on the unique Team Ninja collaboration we asked Sakamoto about the long-rumored Metroid Dread project and barring a confirmation of that product when we d see another 2D handheld Metroid Joystiq Speaking of the core Metroid development team that last worked on the GBA there have been rumors of a game known as Metroid Dread purportedly a 2D Metroid game for DS First question Was Dread a real project Second question If not where is a 2D Metroid on DS Yoshio Sakamoto It seems we get a lot of questions about Metroid Dread especially at interviews following E3 for example But nothing 's ever been announced about this game it 's all just been rumors so far So we never know exactly how to respond to questions like this While there actually was a point where some teams were meeting to discuss if it was possible to create a 2D Metroid for DS using a relatively small team size it 's not something that we ever really announced or thought of as Metroid Dread But whenever people bring out that idea we recognize that the basic concept is something that we can t say never existed But at the same time we can t of course make any official comment about a Metroid Dread-like project coming out Our main goal with Metroid Other M is to as I said earlier first raise knowledge about the Metroid universe and the Samus character before we start to introduce different elements like online or even going back to another handheld game for the next in the series So there 's nothing coming immediately we want to think about these new challenges first But of course we never say never 
In March 2005 a low-key Princeton economist who had become a Federal Reserve governor coined a novel theory to explain the growing tendency of Americans to borrow from foreigners particularly the Chinese to finance their heavy spending The problem he said was not that Americans spend too much but that foreigners save too much The Chinese have piled up so much excess savings that they lend money to the United States at low rates underwriting American consumption This colossal credit cycle could not last forever he said But in a global economy the transfer of Chinese money to America was a market phenomenon that would take years even a decade to work itself out For now he said we probably have little choice except to be patient Today the dependence of the United States on Chinese money looks less benign And the economist who proposed the theory Ben S Bernanke is dealing with the consequences having been promoted to chairman of the Fed in 2006 as these cross-border money flows were reaching stratospheric levels In the past decade China has invested upward of 1 trillion mostly earnings from manufacturing exports into American government bonds and government-backed mortgage debt That has lowered interest rates and helped fuel a historic consumption binge and housing bubble in the United States China some economists say lulled American consumers and their leaders into complacency about their spendthrift ways 
What do you do when things you take for granted su enly disappear on you I 'm not talking people but things that everyone in a developed world takes for granted Today for half my day I got to see such a world and well I 'm not sure how I feel This afternoon there was a power outage at work With no power and no idea when it would return a few of us collected in the cafeteria and played some table tennis It was fun seeing and interacting with colleagues in a new manner You get to see a new side of people that you don t really expect of them After a couple of hours I decided to head home and catch some much needed R R Reached home and thankfully the blackout had not affected my apartment What it had done however was knock out my cable and internet connection Now thats something you don t see everyday and more importantly its not something one expects Now if there 's a blackout you obviously cant really do anything sitting at home This however is like a tease You have electricity but you cant watch TV or get online Everything we do seems to revolve around this ( I should a I couldn t go out because of the heavy downpour that was at play ) I probably should have caught up on my reading or played with my camera instead I pulled out the dvd player dusty and unused and cleaned out my netflix queue Four hours with no connection to the outside world ( yes I restricted use of the iPhone ) and yet somehow I manage to revolve around some form of technology Is it an a iction or just a force of habit that drives this I wonder but I know today I relived a time when this was natural and it felt so very unnatural 
Well we just got a little up close and personal with HTC 's 's uperphone the Desire What you re looking at is basically the Nexus One sans trackball ( though plus an optical touch area ) Certainly the specs are the same though you ve got the new Sense UI on board for good measure At a glance the phone actually doesn t seem as snappy as we were expecting and there are obviously a few kinks to work out with some of the new Sense concepts ( Leap for instance -- the pinch-to-card view -- was giving our demo person some trouble ) Still the Desire is definitely high on our gadget lust list right now We re obviously reserving final judgment for a later date but until we get some more time with this guy feast your eyes on the gallery below Update A ed a quick video after the break showing the Sense UI not behaving Update 2 We ve been told by an HTC rep that the Sense build on the Desire unit we played with is actually quite early so it 's probably not indicative of the actual performance of the pinch-to-card view We played with a Legend that had a later nearly final build of the UI and it was definitely snappier and more responsive 
WASHINGTON For President Obama getting into a serious fight with Israel carries obvious domestic and foreign political risks But it may offer the administration a payoff it sees as worthwhile shoring up Mr Obama 's credibility as a Mi le East peacemaker by showing doubtful Israelis and Palestinians that he has the fortitude to push the two sides toward an agreement Yuri Gripas / Reuters Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said ties between the United States and Israel were still strong Multimedia Back Story With The Times 's Ethan Bronner Related * Israel Objects to U S Construction Demands ( March 17 2010 ) The risks at home were on display on Tuesday as more than two dozen members of Congress many of them Democrats implored Mr Obama to ease the tensions with the Israeli government after its announcement of a Jewish housing plan during a visit by Vice President Joseph R Biden Jr The House Republican whip Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia called the White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel to complain that the administration had seized on a minor diplomatic contretemps to try to impose its views on a loyal friend Sarah Palin the former Republican vice presidential candidate issued a statement urging the president to push the reset button on our relations with our ally Israel For all the angst coming from Capitol Hill however the Obama administration seemed generally unruffled And there were tentative signs that it was taking steps to cool the temperature Mr Biden and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel spoke by telephone on Tuesday evening an administration official said It was not clear what the two men talked about aides to Mr Biden did not return calls 
I am a big Joe Biden fan The vice president is an indefatigable defender of U S interests abroad So it pains me to say that on his recent trip to Israel when Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu 's government rubbed his nose in some new housing plans for contested East Jerusalem the vice president missed a chance to send a powerful public signal He should have snapped his notebook shut gotten right back on Air Force Two flown home and left the following scribbled note behind Message from America to the Israeli government Friends don t let friends drive drunk And right now you re driving drunk You think you can embarrass your only true ally in the world to satisfy some domestic political need with no consequences You have lost total contact with reality Call us when you re serious We need to focus on building our country 
On October 3rd as the spreading economic meltdown threatened to topple financial behemoths like American International Group ( AIG ) and Bank of America and plunged global markets into freefall the U S government responded with the largest bailout in American history The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 better known as the Troubled Asset Relief Program (T ARP ) authorized the use of 700 billion to stabilize the nation 's failing financial systems and restore the flow of credit in the economy The legislation 's guidelines for crafting the rescue plan were clear the TARP should protect home values and consumer savings help citizens keep their homes and create jobs Above all with the government poised to invest hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars in various financial institutions the legislation urged the bailout 's architects to maximize returns to the American people That 700 billion bailout has since grown into a more than 12 trillion commitment by the U S government and the Federal Reserve About 1 1 trillion of that is taxpayer money -- the TARP money and an a itional 400 billion rescue of mortgage companies Fannie Mae and Fre ie Mac The TARP now includes 12 separate programs and recipients range from megabanks like Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase to automakers Chrysler and General Motors Seven months in the bailout 's impact is unclear The Treasury Department has used the recent 's tress test results it applied to 19 of the nation 's largest banks to suggest that the worst might be over yet the International Monetary Fund as well as economists like New York University professor and economist Nouriel Roubini and New York Times columnist Paul Krugmanpredict greater losses in U S markets rising unemployment and generally tougher economic times ahead What cannot be disputed however is the financial bailout 's biggest loser the American taxpayer The U S government led by the Treasury Department has done little if anything to maximize returns on its trillion-dollar taxpayer-funded investment So far the bailout has favored rescued financial institutions by subsidizing their losses to the tune of 356 billion shying away from much-needed management changes and -- with the exception of the automakers -- letting companies take taxpayer money without a coherent plan for how they might return to viability The bailout 's perks have been no less favorable for private investors who are now picking over the economy 's still-smoking rubble at the taxpayers expense The newer bailout programs rolled out by Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner give private equity firms hedge funds and other private investors significant leverage to buy toxic or distressed assets while leaving taxpayers stuck with the lion 's share of the risk and potential losses 
It 's worth wondering what liberals will celebrate when they sit down to their free-range turkey or yummy tofu loafs We can be certain that they ll lift a glass of sulfate-free wine or organic apple cider to family and friends while the rest of us drink our sulfates and pesticides Liberals might like many of us root for their favorite pro or college football teams that is if they don t object to the violence of a male-dominated sport Otherwise what will liberals and conservatives have in common this Thanksgiving Not overeating as liberals don t overeat After all obesity is a crisis in America along with a thousand and one other crises that liberals have catalogued Liberals won t be thankful for McDonald 's or Burger King or Nathan 's Or Little Debbie Snack Cakes or Hostess Ho-Hos or Hershey 's chocolate bars Those along with a lot of other enterprises and products are part of the vast industrial food complex hell-bent on making a profit from expanding waistlines It 's about the fat grams stupid Perhaps they ll celebrate the nation 's economy Though now sputtering under the benign hand of Barack Obama the American economy is the greatest on the planet It has lifted the lives of not only Americans and the nation 's sizable illegal population but has spread the benefits of capitalism individual initiative and creativity across the globe But liberals can t celebrate economic liberty or American economic success All that economic freedom is a bad thing Along with their Big Macs and Twinkies Americans consume too much of the world 's diminishing resources Take energy for instance Americans are energy gluttons They keep their houses too warm in the winter and too cool in the summer They drive gas-guzzlers Some even have powerboats or RVs Others refuse to put low-flow toilets in their bathrooms and use more than a square of toilet paper at a time Go and get more energy Exploit the natural resources that abound on American soil and off its shores Use technology to build nuclear power plants Nonsense Getting more crude oil or natural gas or coal means raping the environment And anyone remember Three Mile Island or Chernobyl Conventional energy use just spews greater amounts of life-choking carbon into the air Despite nine consecutive years of global cooling despite the fraud perpetrated by global warming zealots liberals know just know in the marrow of their bones the world is getting hotter What are we twenty years ten years or five years from the oceans rising and swamping coastlines Or are the oceans supposed to boil off What about all those polar bears dropping from melting icebergs into the briny seas Perhaps liberals can celebrate the success of fellow liberal and mountebank Al Gore The former vice president parlayed his global warming flimflam into a fat bank account and a Nobel Prize You see it 's okay for liberals to get rich or filthy rich in Gore 's case selling carbon offsets or hemp clothes or books bashing George W Bush or Sarah Palin Or making lots of money on Wall Street though that 's supposed to be a secret But Gore has been celebrated so much by liberals that he 's getting to be like the cousin who outstays his welcome 
So my big state-of-economics piece is out Just a few notes since I have to get to bed early we have 27 miles over hills to do tomorrow First to anyone who wishes I d given credit yes I was helped by reading many sources ( especially Justin Fox ) but it 's a magazine article not a book with room for an acknowledgments page I couldn t even acknowledge the editing work done by my wife Robin Wells which played a big role Some fairly extensive sections had to be taken out for example I wanted to include material about Paul Samuelson 's 1948 textbook which reads very well in the current crisis but had to cut it Hyman Minsky also got crowded out Sorry Second on whether the pretty good response of policy-oriented economists in the crisis undercuts the thesis I don t think so I mean yes my colleagues are smart people and some of them are highly flexible and quick on their feet But the fact remains that many of these responses have been completely ad hoc there just wasn t the theoretical development in advance there would have been if the profession hadn t been chasing the neoclassical dream Third on an interesting point raised by Discover ( via Mark Thoma ): won t we eventually have a true theory that 's as beautiful as the full neoclassical version Well one thing 's for sure we don t have that beautiful final theory now so the current choice is between ideas that are beautiful but wrong and a much messier hodgepodge But my guess is that even in the long run it won t be all that neat Discover suggests general relativity versus Newtonian physics but a better model may be meteorology which as I understand it starts from some simple basic principles but is fiendishly complex in practice Actually let me put it this way the economy is a complex system of interacting individuals and these individuals themselves are complex systems Neoclassical economics radically oversimplifies both the individuals and the system and gets a lot of mileage by doing that I for one am not going to banish maximization-and-equilibrium from my toolbox But the temptation is always to keep on applying these extreme simplifications even where the evidence clearly shows that they re wrong What economists have to do is learn to resist that temptation But doing so will inevitably lead to a much messier less pretty view So be it

I have a question for all the commenters out there Would you star in a porn film if someone asked you A real porn film that gets posted on the Internet and everywhere else You get paid Like say two hundred bucks And you get to have sex with a top tier porn star like Lisa Ann or someone like that It all sounds great but would you really go through with it I ve asked myself this question a lot Obviously I 'm married now so I d never accept such an offer But I always posit all sexual hypotheticals to the alternate dimension version of myself that is NOT married with kids I think back when I was 18 and a virgin and back before all porn was on the web I would have said yes Immediately And then I would have failed to get an erection on camera and spent the rest of my life chewing out my genitals But I wonder if I d accept so quickly in the Internet age Every guy DREAMS of starring in a porno of course But you see the fucking lechers and creeps who actually go through with it and it 's hard to want to join them Plus you gotta go through blood tests And you have to take direction People are staring at you And you have to worry about people stumbling upon it somewhere down the line Spouses Siblings Parents Is it worth all that to spend five quality minutes on camera with Sylvia Saint Yeah probably Onto your letters 
Ah the last day off before I head back to work for another set of days on Last Tuesday I experienced for only the second time in my 13 years of law enforcement a traffic stop initiated by the violator Yes while traveling on I-44 Interstate I got behind a vehicle that was going a bit faster than the posted speed limit He noticed me in his rear view mirror and changed lanes Obviously he was unaware of my intentions to change lanes anyway as I was about to exit off of I-40 As soon as I changed lanes and was again behind him he turned on his flashers and began to pull onto the shoulder Well I had the notion of what he was doing and just to make sure he wasn t braking down I pulled off onto the shoulder also and turned on my emergency lights I walked up to the drivers door and he was already gathering his state driver 's license and insurance forms I asked him if everything was alright and he state dI know I was speeding I said yes he was and since he was aware of it to slow down and then got back in my car I think I left him a bit puzzled but I insist that regardless to how many tickets I might write if I can change the driving mentality if just while I 'm present I ve done my job Mrs Dub was complaining Sunday about Daylight Savings Time commenting on how much she hates it and hates losing that hour of sleep I had to remind her that since we stayed in bed till almost 10 am that I didn t think she lost any of it I don t think she agrees I took both of the girls to the gun range today Miss Dub has been chomping at the bit to go and shoot I can even get her to clean my guns with less hassle than feeding the horses I brought the whole armament of the pistols shotgun and AR-15 's This was their first time with the rifles and shotguns We got some practice in on the paper targets and then I turned them loose on the steel targets Everyone loves these as you get the tink 's ound when you hit the target Later in the afternoon we went and saw the new Alice in Wonderland 3D of course Johnny Depp has the problem of overacting so I didn t understand some of what he said but I thought the whole movie was great Be safe and have a great day

We re not going to engage in too much wild speculation on this piece of information but there are certainly a few raised eyebrows in Engadget-land right now Apparently Plastic Logic is no longer offering pre-orders of its QUE proReader as a tipster of ours discovered while trying to push through his order of the 799 99 8GB / 3G version of the large-screen device According to the order page Pre-orders are sold out QUE will be available online and in select Barnes Noble stores this summer This of course comes on the heels of news that the company would be further delaying the ship date from mid-April to summer related to fine-tuning and enhancing the overall product experience So our minds aren t exactly at ease as we re trying to understand why a company wouldn t just caveat pre-orders by letting people know there 's been a run on supply -- though it 's possible that Plastic Logic is doing separate batches for mail order and in-store and just needs to pace themselves We ve reached out to the company for comment and we ll let you know as soon as we hear back

Although he is known for his high-rises resorts and golf courses Donald J Trump helped create a little-known state park in northern Westchester County donating the land for public use in 2006 Like many things the park is named after him It is called the Donald J Trump State Park It also happens to be on a list of 58 parks and historic sites the state plans to close because of budget cuts The plan released Feb 19 coupled with the fact that the state would save only the park 's 2 500 annual budget by closing it has infuriated Mr Trump If they re going to close it I ll take the land back said Mr Trump who donated the 436 acres on which the park sits to the state after his attempts to develop the parcels grew costly and frustrating It 's too bad the parks department is doing this to the people and the state he said I gave that land for the purposes of a park and I always believed that once a park is there it would always be a park Officials with the state 's Office of Parks Recreation and Historic Preservation say the state will not be returning Mr Trump 's land 
At Oregon football players steal laptops from frat houses At tiny ( but expensive ) Drew University a lacrosse player is accused of stealing and re-selling priceless historical artifacts Drew is a private liberal arts school in Madison NJ affiliated with the United Methodist Church It 's the most expensive school in the state and has a world-class archive of letters from such luminaries as Abe Lincoln FDR and the founders of the church Well they have less of an archive now thanks to freshman defenseman William John Scott Scott perhaps surprisingly for a lacrosse player with three first names got an on-campus job in October Fortuitously for black market antiques dealers it was at the university 's archives and almost immediately things went missing This month a dealer in England contacted the school about some letters he had purchased purporting to be written by Methodist Church founder John Wesley The school investigated and found that 21 of 23 of its Wesley Letters were missing After combing through Mr Scott 's dorm room federal agents discovered a file containing six Wesley letters besides the ones that were sent to England The file also contained roughly 11 other important and historical documents from the university archives including letters from five United States presidents Abraham Lincoln Andrew Johnson William McKinley Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Dwight D Eisenhower The file also had letters belonging to the university from Richard Nixon when he was vice president Robert F Kennedy and Madame Chiang Kai-Shek 
In November we went to Disneyland with our friends and neighbors the Heatons We had an absolute blast This was part of our Christmas to our family and it was a much needed break from life and a chance to have some fun as a family Kinsley wasn t too thrilled when we told her about the rides and stuff but when we told her that she would be meeting the princesses her eyes became like saucers and she got soooo excited She met as many as she could and even met some of the others like Mickey Mouse Pluto and Woody and Jessie She actually liked most of the rides like Matterhorn and Space Mountain but absolutely hated Splash Mountain When we got to the bottom of that drop Kristie and I ( who were sitting behind her ) asked what she thought and she started bawling She really didn t like that experience so to get her on any other ride we couldn t include the word 'm ountain in the name or she wouldn t get on Kenton loved all the sights animals rides etc The first ride we went on was Pirate 's of the Carribean ( my absolute fav ) just to see how the kids would fare with this Geoff used his phone to see Kenton 's facial expression when we first went in the dark tunnel before it dropped His eyes were wide and his hands were in fists and stuck to the front of his mouth But he loved it He kept getting excited at all the animals and moving people He really loved it Kinsley loved it too She said that was her favorite ride In the two days we were there we went on that one 3 times All in all it was a great vacation and one we hope to repeat again sooner than later 
It 's certainly not business as usual in Washington D C but that 's probably not what the American people had in mind when they elected President Barack Obama to come to the White House and usher in a new era of change And this diversion from business as usual is something former Fox News Special Report anchor Brit Hume now a senior political analyst for network said he had never seen before The veteran Washington D C journalist said on the March 16 broadcast of FNC 's America Live that with the potential of the House invoking the Slaughter Rule and the potential 51-vote reconciliation process in the Senate the process was far from pure I think the process is well tainted by now Hume said This is a case where in the face of a level of resistance that I have never seen before in the sense on a bill that the sponsors continue to push I ve never seen anything pushed this far for this long in the face of such resistance of this size This is unprecedented Read more http // newsbusters org / blogs / jeff-poor /2010/03/16/ hume-befu led-washington-press-corps-sign-pelosi-health-care-moves-unpre ixzz0iPKm0PqR 
A reader alerts us to a story in the Dayton Daily News about a Presbyterian minister taking up the cause of housing discrimination against Hispanic immigrants While it 's unclear where the picture accompanying the story was taken notice the Marian images -- a big no-no in Calvinist theology -- in the background Might he be incorporating Catholic props to assist his 'm issionary efforts with immigrants from Catholic strongholds in Central and South America Even if not it 's striking that he would permit himself to be photographed for a newspaper in such a setting 
In 2008 just four years after leaving NBC News Jane Pauley gave the maximum allowed donation to Barack Obama ( 2 300 ) and campaigned for him in her native Indiana where she proclaimed I want to see the cool steady hand of Barack Obama on that Bible on Inauguration Day and predicted Obama will be an exceptional President enthusing I so look forward to it On Tuesday morning ( March 9 ) Pauley reappeared on the Today show which she co-hosted from 1976 to 1989 before spending more than a decade with Dateline NBC as the narrator of a new monthly segment produced by the liberal AARP Your Life Calling Today about those 50-plus reinventing themselves We are welcoming back a very underline very good friend and familiar face around here Jane Pauley Matt Lauer announced explaining 's he 's been working with AARP which has produced and sponsored a new series of reports for us Her first report looked at a woman who left a lucrative career so she would have more time to knit socks Not exactly hard-hitting political reporting but it gives me a hook to share some 2008 video of Pauley praising Obama as she made appearances on his behalf Pauley called the last eight years a mistake and says America must make the right choice come election day WISH-TV channel 8 reporter Phil Sanchez related on the Indianapolis CBS affiliate 's Sunday September 21 2008 newscast Just over a month later following an event in Bloomington sporting an Obama button she told Indiana University 's public TV station WTIU Read more http // newsbusters org / blogs / brent-baker /2010/03/13/ pauley-back-nbc-yearned-cool-steady-hand-exceptional-obama ixzz0iPOfYWBL 
There is no web archive available - that I have found - of this page so no way to compare at the moment to the older version - which was HORRIBLE with a capital H I even apologized for it Now it is one of the best pages on the site Numerous video clips from CNN on UFO sightings - from the past few years in the USA - Phoenix Texas Chicago airport Also nuclear missile interference from a little farther back in time Also Mexican government and military Interviews and sightings / reports from (3) NASA astronauts - Buzz Aldrin Edgar Mitchell ( Both moon walkers ) and Gordon Cooper ( Mercury 7 - Seven ) Can there be any doubt left ( I ll take on the skeptic arguments in another page soon too for good measure - a 's hell page is already there ) This is just a selection from what is out there on the Internet Of course many other full length UFO videos are linked in the section too Though some have been taken offline due to copyright patrols Also the latest news and videos on invisibility technology advancements - and discussion on why more people don t see UFOs -- a psychological one -- people are too busy looking down Literally I 'm looking forward to tackling each topic in the COSMIC CLUES and bringing them up to my standard of presentation - while tackling other topics too With some exceptions many of the topics have just been containers where I copied links and videos into with not much thought on presentation and organization The same could be said of the reincarnation topics One step at a time -- and soon I will have climbed the mountain This will be last update for a couple of weeks - going to do some exploring I realize I was both burnt out last year from writing ( And moving ) and also burnt our from learning other important things But the final pieces are coming together in my mind on how TO BE And this year -- I am planning on saying adios to eating too - as has been shown with Ram Bomjon / Bu ha Boy Water and Light and changing of the mind And it will be quite shocking on what I have been doing to accomplish this

When Rafael Palmiero was outed as having used steroids there was a mix of apathy (s ince everyone knew ) and disgust (s ince he had lied to Congress about it ) When Tiger Woods was outed as an unfaithful husband again people were a little surprised but again mostly disappointed that he tried to act like it didn t happen Now it 's Allen Iverson 's turn Iverson has always been a character whether it 's talking about practice or simply his bachelor lifestyle Unfortunately for him the latter appears to have caught up with him Hearing that an NBA player has been banned from multiple casinos for his gambling and drinking problems isn t much of a surprise It isn t even a huge surprise when you know that it 's Iverson However to think that a man who is 34 years old has five children and has been a father since he was 19 has yet to take steps to deal with a problem that not only could but likely will tear his family apart is a bit surprising As Smith mentions Iverson 's career has been on a downturn in recent years I suppose it should be no shock that the man who was too proud to further his career by taking a role as a backup should take this long to finally wrestle with his inner demons but better late than never 
i haven t really been thinking about the significance of numbers until recently i won about 28 Euros at lottery last week i felt happy because you know it was my first time buying lottery ( just for about 3 euros ) i bought it with a friend thinking we would try it for the first time in our lives just for fun so i was pleasantly surprised to receive this money it was not too much but enough to last me for about 2 days here in germany i am not going to have buying lottery as my lifestyle / hobby / or a iction but a spontaneous act in our lives can sometimes surprise us i remembered i was using many Sevens when i wrote those random numbers down on the lottery paper i am not saying that seven is a lucky number but i am saying it just happened that this time round the results showed many sevens and numbers that have sevens in it that was when i started thinking about numbers in my life i really like 5 and 7 from a biblical point of view 7 is a number of completion and perfection there is a mystery about 7 that makes me feel at rest the number reminds us that we have got to rest and not allow the burdens and responsibilities in our lives to distract us God rests on the seventh day there is the sabbath but i think it is not a rigid rule to rest however it does our souls and bodies good when we merely rest inwardly Religion tells us that we need to do lots in order to earn credits from God However Christ has finished the work 2000 years ago There is nothing we can do to earn anything Hebrews 4 from the bible verse10 says for all who enter into God 's rest wll find rest from their labors just as God rested after creating the world Besides dreaming which i talked about it in my last entry the land of rest is also a beautiful place 
When former New York Times editor Howell Raines decided to attack the Fox News Channel and blame the news outlet for President Barack Obama 's shortcomings there was bound to be a response And delivering that response was The O Reilly Factor host Bill O Reilly who called his show the signature broadcast of the network O Reilly dismissed Raines as a lunatic However he was also critical of The Washington Post for giving him an outlet to trot out his ranting I think there is a more important thing in play here O Reilly said The Washington Post has given this guy Raines a big platform on Sunday this coming Sunday to print this nonsense and it is nonsense If Raines were sitting here I could carve him up and he Raines knows it But O Reilly questioned why the Post had decided to give Raines the space in its upcoming March 14 issue to rip on his network According to O Reilly this was an effort to rally the media for a last stand Read more http // newsbusters org / blogs / jeff-poor /2010/03/12/ o-reilly-blasts-raines-anti-fox-news-op-ed-shame-washington-post ixzz0iPLXscJC 
When it comes to apps the iPhone platform is now bigger than the Facebook platform according to a report by Flurry a San Francisco-based mobile analytics company Flurry said today that Apple 's iTunes App Store has over 140 000 applications compared to 60 000 apps available on the Facebook platform Since the App Store launched in July 2008 35 000 unique companies have released applications which translates to 58 new companies launching apps each day Furry said in its Smartphone Industry Pulse report for February 2010 iphonevsfacebook pngThat 's quite amazing considering that Facebook launched its platform more than a year earlier than the iPhone platform and has north of 400 million users In comparison the iPhone OS platform has about 70 million devices And developer momentum for the iPhone platform isn t going to wane anytime soon Why To paraphrase Jerry McGuire Apple is showing developers the money Thanks to its one-click payment option it 's easy for app developers to make money - whether it 's by selling apps or selling virtual goods within apps ipadpushesiphoneapps pngWith the iPad showing up as a platform extension more developers are looking to focus their energies on the iPhone platform Over six weeks since Apple announced the iPad Flurry continues to measure a significant increase in iPhone OS new application starts within its system the analytics firm said Much of it is said to be developers looking to adapt their applications for the larger-format device The most interesting part of the Flurry report was the iPhone developer DNA Its analysis revealed the following categories 1 Native iPhone Companies founded to create applications for iPhone ( e g PageOnce ngmoco ) 2 Traditional Media Companies established on Film TV Print and Radio ( e g Disney TBS New York Times ) 3 Mobile Companies having started on J2ME BREW BlackBerry etc ( e g Digital Chocolate eBu y ) 4 Retail CPG Brick-and-mortar companies or ones that manufacture goods ( e g The Gap DKNY Kraft ) 5 Online Companies who began on the web including e-Commerce social networks online gaming streaming music etc ( e g Google eBay Facebook Pandora PopCap Zynga ) 6 Traditional Gaming Video game companies from console portable or PC ( e g EA Activision Namco etc ) iphonedeveloperdna gifDespite the fact that the App Store is now maturing reaching its two year anniversary this summer we are encouraged that native iPhone application developers are still relevant representing 20 % of the heritage pie the second largest category This means that the barrier to entry is still low enough for start-ups to enter and innovation to flourish However those days may be numbered as discoverability has become a significant issue and now 'm arketing muscle is starting to count more in the App Store 
NorthScale a Mountain View Calif-based startup co-founded by leaders of memcached open source projects launched today after spending a year hiding in the shadows The company which has raised 5 million in venture funding from Accel Partners and North Bridge Venture Partners is part of a growing number of startups hoping to cash in on the data deluge facing everyone from small-time publishers to web giants According to IDC in 2012 the amount of digital information produced in the year should equal nearly 2 500 exabytes ( equivalent to 2 500 billion gigabytes ) or 5 times that produced in 2008 driven primarily by the Internet Today 's web is a lot different from the web of 10 years ago More users more connections and more time spent online are some of the hallmarks of today 's popular web-based services such as Digg Facebook Twitter and Zynga As a result these services generate mountains of data The more information there is the harder it becomes to make sense of it And the problem is only exacerbated by the use of relational databases generally viewed by many as yesterday 's technology 
In my last appearance in Pajamas Media a couple of months ago (\ Does Sexual Equality Require Preferential Treatment ) I asked Will the movement for gay rights follow the same trajectory as racial equality from non-discrimination to preferential treatment based on sexual persuasion That question must now be applied to college or at least to college applicants Inside Higher Ed has just reported ( Feb 26 ) that the University of Pennsylvania may be the first institution to launch what is described as an outreach program for gay students That program I think suggests a number of interesting questions but before we get to the assumptions underlying and implications flowing from gay outreach let 's pause a moment at everyday garden variety outreach At many colleges IHE 's article begins outreach is a standard part of the recruiting process once applicants are admitted Current students who share individual traits or academic interests help reach out to prospective students with similar backgrounds or interests So the young woman who expresses an interest in engineering will hear from a female junior in engineering A black admit might hear from a black student and so forth The idea is that these students may be uniquely well positioned to answer questions and to make the case that the college is a good place to be a female engineer a black undergrad or whatever Reading that I couldn t help wondering what if that black student were a female engineering major Would she be tasked with reaching out only to black female prospective engineering majors To all black females To all blacks whether prospective engineering majors or not Given that heavy workload shouldn t Penn take affirmative action to make sure it has more than one black female engineering major Moreover since everyone knows (d oesn t everyone ) that Asians tend to be geeks who segregate themselves in math and science shouldn t Penn have an Asian literature major to reach out to prospective Asian English or philosophy majors ( or two one male and one female ) Doesn t diversity require such an effort 
What is Google Buzz for As with any social networking tool or social media service this is the fundamental question both Google and its users collectively have to answer Part of the reason why Buzz has come under so much criticism over privacy and other issues ( which Google a ressed during a panel at SXSW this weekend ) is that users and the search company seem to have different ideas about what Buzz is and how it should be used To the company 's credit it has been listening and adapting as quickly as it can and has even asked sociologist and Microsoft researcher Danah Boyd to come and speak about privacy and Buzz at Google after she gave a very critical talk at SXSW about the service Apart from the privacy aspect of Buzz one of the ongoing debates about the service is whether it should be used for aggregating or publishing or both When Buzz was first released many people ( including me ) did what they thought the creators of the service wanted them to do they followed a bunch of their contacts from Gmail and then selected a bunch of other content platforms and social networks to connect to their Buzz stream Flickr photos Google Reader shared items Twitter and so on But a growing number of Buzz users are unhappy with the practice of connecting various content streams to the service Like Egon Spengler from Ghostbusters they don t want people to cross the streams One of the most thoughtful critics of this practice has been Mahendra Palsule an editor at Techmeme who goes by the handle Sceptic Geek Both on Buzz and on his personal blog Palsule has described what he sees as the downside of combining multiple streams into one place namely repetition a lack of focus etc But mostly he seems to feel that dumping content from one social network into another defeats the purpose and that the right thing to do is to create and publish content specifically for Buzz in other words to treat it as a separate platform like a blog rather than as an aggregator

During a one-on-one conversation with writer Frank Rose at South by Southwest titled The Emotion Engine Can a Video Game Speak to the Heart Lionhead 's Peter Molyneux offered some early details on the episodic potential of Fable 3 citing the serial nature of Charles Dickens novels He began by comparing Fable 3 's industrial setting to the mid-19th century setting of Charles Dickens London calling it a brilliant time to set a game You look at the characters and the world that someone like Charles Dickens developed and you think Well it would be brilliant to feel like you re walking through that Dickensian version of London with a little bit of darkness Those novels if you don t know them are very very dark Molyneux explained They re written in a way that breaks the story up into these episodes So why don t we do a similar sort of thing Though Molyneux told Joystiq just last week that Fable 2 's episodic experiment had been 'm assively successful he stopped short of promising similar functionality for Fable 3 however yesterday he seemed to suggest they would be doing just that So what we re thinking with Fable 2 to start off with and with Fable 3 we re going to give you the first big episode and then allow you to continue to download new episodes Molyneux said And that 's analogous to the way Charles Dickens wrote his books Asked if he would be developing these episodes as you go along Molyneux responde dThis is the new world of computer games where in fact a lot of us are now saying is If we can have a really strong digital relationship with people then that means you don t have to entirely finish your game or your universe or your experience on release Now before you get upset appreciate that Molyneux knows how 's trange and bizarre that sounds so he 's got two examples to help you better understand So we ve got these things these couple of simple things we ve got in Fable 3 which are really really nice The first is that some of the shops in the world of Albion are actually linked to the internet and are populated by the staff of Lionhead every so often So they don t have to be fixed things we can put new stuff in the world all the time And you don t have to go out to some horrible Dashboard and download The Armage on Pack version 5 or drive down to a retailer and wait for some big pack to come out The sort of thing we re thinking of I suppose I shouldn t tell you this but I ll tell you anyway after you ve been playing the game for awhile you ll see this ferry Molyneux reveals This ferry keeps coming into Bowerstone and going away It goes off to these islands that we ve been talking about but there 's no way you can buy a ticket So one of the things that we enable online is this ticket to this ferry and actually in this ticket is the islands so we make it feel like you ve downloaded this ticket when in matter-of-fact you ve downloaded the islands While this provides some glimpse into what Molyneux has planned for Fable 3 it 's hard to determine how extensively these ideas will be woven into the experience

Americans have been so busy fighting against President Obama 's great Red Army-type offensives on health care reform the federalization of big chunks of the economy and spending that will bury us under an avalanche of debt that his educational plans have drawn relatively little attention Since higher education is my main policy domain I have been watching that front In February of last year Obama announced that the nation was not doing well enough in getting young people into and through college He told Americans that they d be letting the country down if they stopped their education after high school and announced a national goal of having the highest percentage of college-educated workers in the world by 2020 That sounds good Having the best-educated workforce will certainly help to keep our economy strong in the face of international competition won t it Most people would probably nod in approval but I see Obama 's higher education initiative as an economically harmful Trojan Horse meant to accomplish his real objectives assisting one of his most loyal support groups and luring more young Americans into the overwhelmingly leftist collectivistic college environment which tends to draw impressionable people towards the left end of the political spectrum What about the notion that the nation 's economy needs more college graduates Those who want to justify an expansion of our higher education system ( that is subsidizing some students who wouldn t otherwise have gone to college so that they will ) often say that we re falling behind other nations in our educational attainment They say that unless we get more young Americans through college for the first time we ll have a generation that is less well educated than the previous generation They say that college graduates enjoy a large lifetime earnings premium And they say that nearly all good jobs now require a college degree All those arguments are either false or irrelevant 
To tell you the truth the honest god forsaken and all the different kinds it comes in truth - I don t know that much of the written word to describe how much of a blast it was But if you were in front of me and saw my hand gestures the excited tone in my voice the eyebrows with a mind of their own the bulging eyes themselves you d see my point Even if I didn t have to pin you to a wall and scream it out you d see it I lived those two weeks I laughed I danced I drank I sat on a horse I wore heavier clothes than I ve ever worn some jewelry too yes I hugged a thousand people I reflected a million flashes of the camera on my skin I made my jaws ache by smiling so much I walked in a daze I saw family and friends I hadn t seen in ages and I cried for it and I smiled for it and she looked so lovely through it all And I crossed my fingers every time I managed a secret glance at her Now we re busy assembling ikea furniture and the camera 's are slung on tourist necks clicking past me at the buildings and the concrete Shit I miss the attention 
We d like to think college basketball scheduling is a thoroughly considered professional process among teams conferences and the NCAA But no There 's a message board where teams look for hook-ups Let 's explore the Craigslist of college hoops We came across this today via a throwaway link from Brooks but the schedule boards at Basketball Travelers deserve a closer look It 's mostly weaker teams looking to fill out their schedules but there are some big players here Ever wonder how Kansas opened this season with Alcorn State and Central Arkansas Probably through this board For next season they re 's eeking a guarantee game for November 21 or 22 Guarantee game being of course a guaranteed win (Up date Nittany White Out points out that a guarantee game is simply a guaranteed home game with no obligation for a home and home ) Then there are teams like St Bonaventure who are offering themselves up as a guaranteed loss They want to attract a high major team for a home and home series including one at the 19 000 seat arena in Buffalo That d be big money for the Bonnies but they ve got to reassure the interested teams that they won t put up much of a fight :\ We are losing two of our top three scorers for next season 
While Metroid director Yoshio Sakamoto may not have played Shadow Complex the XBLA darling 's creators definitely played Metroid During a panel titled Designing Shadow Complex Chair Entertainment Creative Director Donald Mustard encouraged the audience of prospective downloadable game makers to embrace genre limitations So genre is one of your limitations because you aren t just competing against other games that are released in the downloadable space Mustard said pacing across the stage You really are competing against Gears of War Mass Effect 2 Uncharted 2 That is the real competition and you need to find a way to differentiate yourself from those kinds of games And that is an awesome opportunity For Mustard that meant moving orthogonally from what the big 60 retail games are doing Mustard sai dFor us what that ultimately meant is target an old and abandoned genre Which to us was kind of this Metroidvania side scroller adventure genre that had been abandoned No one was making games in this genre And we said What if we took that genre and fused that with some of the modern sensibilities that had come out some of the modern ideas of AI and physics and graphics That would be a really cool combination Shadow Complex map Chair created ( and played through ) the entire map in Illustrator And guess what Nobody can do that at the 60 price point No one can do that No one 's going to make a next-gen side scroller in this style so we said We re going to and we re going to do it on this platform If you even wanted to experience that kind of game you need to either have a Super Nintendo or a Game Boy or an original PlayStation There was nothing on 360 even remotely close to this Of course Mustard knew that the media would be intrinsically interested in what he and his team were putting together and with no marketing budget support from the media was vital to the game 's success In just ten months six artists and three programmers at Chair Entertainment had created Joystiq 's 7 game of 2009 
I have a big work project coming up We do this SUPER thing once a year where my life becomes really long days for about six weeks It eats away at my soul and the only reason I put up with it is because the pay is outrageous On the other hand by the time it is over I am exhausted and quite pissy Which means writing is going to become a real bitch It is hard to write after you are sitting in front of a computer for 10 hours It is hard to write when you can think of a hundred other things that need to be done It is really hard to write when what you want to be doing is anything BUT sit in front of a computer some more But you know tough shit I read a lot of articles about writing The number one complaint among writers is the lack of time they have for writing They have kids They have hobbies They have spouses who like to be noticed every once in awhile I get it I sympathize It can be really tough to find the time to write If it was easy to find time then everyone would be writers I think you have to mean about time I think you have to be vicious There is time to write but man you have to claw for it You have to plan for it stalk it and then pounce When it is time to write you gotta be ready I learned this at the car factory I used to work at Man you have not gone insane till you worked a 12 hour day when all you really want to do is bust out a BDSM epic I used to have literally half an hour a day to write It was sandwiched between be getting home and having to go to sleep for the day so I can get enough rest to go back to work I used to get so much done in that half hour Mostly because I spent 12 hours thinking about it I had details worked out names decided and all those tiny things that slow you down I told the story to myself all night long I rehearsed it orally to myself By the time that magic half hour rolled around my fingers just flew I 'm not saying it is easy Every day life throws new shit at us If you work at a job where you actually have to use your brain like I do now you will be forced to work on your stories during bathroom breaks driving and eating If you are lucky you will be dreaming it That is the thing about writing We rarely are fortunate enough to have the time we want when we want it The only solution is to fucking seize it where we can

After almost three years of conference speaking I achieved a first at a recent conference The feedback from my session contained no negative comments Normally even if the majority of people loved your session you get at least a few people who didn t like the slides / code / choice of clothing etc but not this time this time there wasn t a single negative comment So that must have made me a cert for top speaker or at least in the top three right I mean I ve been top speaker before when my talks have had a few negative comments so this time with no negative comments I must have rocked to the top Well actually no You see this conference like many others has a metric to record how useful the attendees felt your talk was i e how relevant is it to your day to day work and how soon / easily could you put the lessons learned into practice Now my talk was on how functional programming can help solve many of the concurrency problems inherent in today 's OO language dominated solutions By definition of course that meant that most of the audience were OO programmers and so none of them were going back to the office on the Monday morning to implement the lessons learned from my talk this meant that my talk scored between 1 3 out of 5 for usefulness As this score counts towards the final score this placed me in the bottom half of all speakers at the conference Now I know what you are thinking who cares right I mean everyone had a great time everyone learned something everyone went away thinking about what they had learned the feedback says so and that 's all that matters Other than my ego no one cares about the scores Sadly it 's not that simple You see many conferences will use your score from previous attendances to decide if they want you to come back again and a low score is a low score no matter what the feedback says And that is the horns of the dilemma Should speakers turn out good presentations that everyone loves but score low and risk not getting invited back or should they concentrate on topics that are still good but focus on things that are immediately useful to the audience to the detriment of their broader education As Sherlock Holmes would say I think this is a two pipe problem

The window is closing on comprehensive immigration reform At least that 's what the politicians in Washington are saying They re afraid of more demagoguery They re afraid of upcoming elections They re afraid of the politics of fear But I am more and more troubled by how little they seem concerned about the worsening plight of many of America 's most vulnerable families -- about how families are being broken up by the U S government forcibly separating children from their parents And for the media immigration reform is just another looming political conflict to report more of the gamesmanship of Washington to cover As always the real stories of real people get lost in the win / lose politics of the nation 's capital Yes the nation is going through some tremendous challenges right now And we all know that Congress is hesitant to tackle tough issues before mid-term elections But while politicians can write off one more piece of legislation on a packed agenda they won t be able to write off or ignore a movement rooted in our faith communities If our political leaders won t make room for the 's trangers among us we will -- because Jesus commands us to do so Significant social change does not begin with Congress and it doesn t happen overnight it usually takes a movement and it always takes courage Sojourners has been convening educating and mobilizing Christians nationwide through our Christians for Comprehensive Immigration Reform campaign for the past three years and we are proud to be in good company with the growing interfaith movement fighting for dignity and justice for immigrants On March 21 2010 tens of thousands of supporters of immigration reform will join together in Washington D C for the March for America Change Takes Courage In the faith community we have amended the tagline to read Change Takes Courage and Faith because courage truly does come from our faith Changes to our immigration system will simply not happen without both courage and faith For many of us faith is a catalyst to action that can solve the really big issues -- and this is one of the biggest ones we face now People of faith will look beyond the political calculations and see this for the moral and family crisis it is It will take people of faith to knock down the doors of Congress and bring the stories of immigrant friends neighbors and family members as evidence of the injustices that are experienced on a daily basis Finally we need faith in a God who is larger than we can imagine the God who cries as we humans build border walls to separate ourselves from our brothers and sisters on the other side the God of justice who isn t persuaded by the political timetables of Washington D C 
I knew the USA-Canada hockey game on Sunday night would be big I just didn t know how big a U S victory would be For obvious reasons this was Canada 's game to win And after watching both teams play their first few games I figured the Canadians with the clear advantage in star power wouldn t have trouble disposing of a much younger inexperienced American team by 2-3 goals But in my mind there was only one handicap Canada could have given Team USA Marty Brodeur They played him in goal and it cost them big-time Don t get me wrong there 's no doubt that Brodeur is one of the best goaltenders to have ever played the game Here 's a brief glimpse of his killer resume The NHL 's all-time leader in regular season wins shutouts and games played More than 30 franchise records including most all-time regular season and playoff wins shutouts games and lowest goals-against average 3 Stanley Cup championships Four-time Vezina Trophy winner four-time Jennings Trophy winner 10-time NHL All Star and a Calder Memorial Trophy winner One of only two NHL goaltenders to have scored goals in both the regular season and the playoffs the only NHL goalie to score a game-winning goal Brodeur is known for his hybrid goaltending style by standing up more than butterfly goalies who drop to their knees often It 's gotten him this far and even at his veteran age of 38 I d still take him over half the goalies in the NHL But when I ve watched Brodeur play periodically in the past few years he 's given up questionable goals mostly as a result of his unconventional style of play During this relatively new generation of super-athletic butterfly-sliding goalies Brodeur has become outdated But don t take that as an insult Marty you ve been incredibly successful as New Jersey 's starting netminder for the past 19 seasons Canada started Roberto Luongo in net for their opening Olympic game against Norway Apparently coach Mike Babcock planned on going with the more-experienced Brodeur as his No 1 for the tournament but wanted to get Luongo 's skates wet in case he needed to call on him later But instead of anticipating sub-par play from his starting goalie Babcock should have stuck with Luongo ( an All Star in his own right playing on his home ice ) similar to how the Team USA coach Ron Wilson preselected Ryan Miller to play the entire way Babcock handed the reins over to Brodeur against Switzerland in the second game Had Luongo played against Team USA on Sunday night I 'm not so sure so many Americans would have been celebrating I say this chiefly because the 6 3 butterflyer would have stopped the goals that Brodeur let in And this goes back to what I was saying before Brodeur may have been a better goalie five years ago but Luongo is now 
At last night 's Bigg Digg Shindigg in Austin TX Digg CEO Jay Adelson briefly revealed plans for a massive overhaul of the social news site This morning I had an opportunity to chat with Adelson in-depth about the new Digg and what users publishers and the web as a whole should expect To sum it up Adelson says the new strategy will enable social curation of all the world 's content and the conversation around it To get there though Digg (D igg ) has re-built its entire site from the ground up with dramatic changes that will be rolled out over the coming weeks and months New User Experience The days of the Digg homepage as we know it the most recently popular stories on the service as a whole are numbered The site is shifting towards a personalization model where the homepage will be based on characters like a user 's interests location who they follow not only on Digg but services like Twitter (T witter ) and Facebook ( Facebook ) and other 's ignals from around the web like retweets Facebook shares and more But Adelson notes that not all of these signals are created equal for example a retweet from a Twitter user with millions of followers will weigh much more heavily in the site 's ranking algorithms than one from a user with a few dozen The concept of a Digg account is also changing While you can already use Digg via Facebook Connect the site plans to support logging in with Twitter Google ( Google ) Yahoo and OpenID among other identity providers 
Smartphone owners are more interested in receiving coupons on their handsets than getting other kinds of mobile come-ons according to figures released today by Compete com It 's just the latest evidence that while mobile advertising as a whole is slowly gaining traction mobile coupons may be about to take off in a big way Compete found that grocery coupons were the most attractive of 10 types of mobile marketing ploys with 36 percent of U S smartphone owners saying there were interested in receiving the discount offers on their handsets Twenty-nine percent said they wanted to scan barcodes with their phones while only 15 percent were interested in receiving text message ads Interestingly Compete 's findings come just days after the launch of what may be the nation 's biggest mobile-coupon campaign Target this week began delivering mobile coupons that can be scanned at the retail counter Consumers can visit the retailer 's mobile web site or text the word COUPONS to the short code 827438 (T ARGET ) to opt in and receive a link to a mobile web page containing multiple offers accessible through a single barcode Mobile coupons have been around for the better part of a decade but have failed to really take off thanks to a lack of widespread retail support and a user experience that is often intolerable The market is positioned to pick up some serious momentum in the next few years though according to a recent report from Juniper Research which expects it to exceed 300 million people worldwide by 2014 That forecast might look modest if Target 's campaign gets legs and other nationwide retailers follow suit

It was 25 years ago today when the first dot-com was registered Cambridge Masssa -based Symbolics computers Over the years dot-coms became symbolic of both the Internet bubble and bust now they re simply part of our everyday lives More than 650 000 dot-com domains are registered every month current estimates put the total number at over 71 million I remember signing up for my first domain in 1994 a whole nine years after the first dot-com domain was registered It was quite an antiquated process it took a whole lot of faxing to get it done ( I 'm sure many of today 's young entrepreneurs have no idea what I 'm talking about ) Even back then I had a tough time picking up my most wanted domain Om com 
Until reminded by Mona Charen I had forgotten ( or repressed the memory ) that Rigoberta Menchu won the Nobel Prize in 1992 for her fraudulent autobiography I Rigoberta Menchu As evidence of their privileging (d on t you hate it when people make verbs out of nouns ) hope over change perhaps the Nobels awarded the prize to I Barack for much the same reason to honor his promise more than his performance Just as they honored the inner truth of what she had written and said more than the external literal factual accuracy of her pronouncements The similarities between these two icons of the multicultural left are enhanced of course by the recent revival summarized ably here and here by Ron Radosh of suggestions that Obama may not have been the actual literal author of his own autobiography For those of you who ve forgotten ( or are too young to remember ) I Rigoberta Menchu purported to be the autobiography of a poor Guatemalan who overcame extreme poverty ( a younger brother starved to death etc ) and violent oppression at the hands of Guatemala 's brutal right-wing oligarchs ( who she wrote burned another brother to death before her very own young eyes ) Her book composed from tapes recorded by E Burgos-Debray an ethnologist and the wife of French Marxist theorist and revolutionary ( he was in Bolivia with Che Guevara ) Regis Debray told its gripping story in moving and telling details and quickly elevated her to iconic status among European intellectuals and American academics 
Earlier I wrote a few paragraphs entitled Why Guys Who Watch Porn Will Never Get Married The title was admittedly inaccurate and was used to grab the attention of the reader The purpose of the post was to expose what is often hi en behind all the supposed glamour of porn and how porn negatively impacts relationships But the post was incomplete as it left no hope for the one who struggles and may have conveyed that they are trapped in this sin So we ask why do those who sin have hope ( and not just with porn but a host of heart sins which affect relationship - words lack of forgiveness envy greed etc ) Where do they find encouragement We want to look at just two places from Scripture First in 1 Corinthians 6 9-11 Paul lists a number of sins among them sexually immorality greed drunkenness and slander Is the believer ever trapped Paul writes And that is what some of you were But you were washed you were sanctified you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God There is hope which begins with our standing before God We are a changed people in His sight - we are washed ( cleansed ) sanctified (s et apart made holy ) justified ( given a righteous standing before God because of Jesus ) It would seem strange that someone who struggles with sexual immorality would never be able to grow in holiness and therefore never grow more and more conformed to their standing before God This gives the believer great hope because the change will not ultimately come because we change ourselves but simply and profoundly because God will change us God within us through His Spirit will grow us in holiness This change is often gradual and therefore the believer must continually come back to the cross being reminded of God 's work in us God will mercifully and graciously discipline us so we become more like our Father in heaven Second Romans 6 tells us that we are no longer slaves to sin but slaves to righteousness The good news here is not only is God working on our behalf but humanly speaking God gives us means to strengthen our resolve to walk in holiness We are not powerless and the grip of sin is never stronger than the grip of God And so the person struggling with porn words envy greed or anger is able to bow before a sovereign God pleading mercy and then rise using God-given resources to battle unrighteousness And so is there hope Absolutely It is an amazing paradox that in the glamour of porn we find death and in the horror of Christ 's death we find life 
When Peter O Hanlon opened the Blarney Bar in downtown Jamaica Queens in 1965 he served a mostly white clientele including the union leaders and members who held their meetings in the back room Now the clientele is largely black with an increasing number of Ecuadoreans a growing local population Mr O Hanlon tends bar and is often the only white man in the place these days If an Irishman comes in now we treat them with kid gloves because we don t see them very often said Mr O Hanlon 73 who nevertheless has decked out the place in green for St Patrick 's Day Change in New York City can be seen through many different prisms and if your prism is a pub window or perhaps the bottom of a pint glass you can see old New York meeting the new in Irish bars in neighborhoods that are no longer Irish As Irish populations in saloon-heavy areas have given way to more recent waves of immigrants a few Irish bars remain looking a bit incongruous with their green awnings lilting names and shamrock neon signs in the windows Some hang on as the last strongholds of the old Irish guard like Paradise Alley a bar surrounded by Korean businesses on 150th Street in downtown Flushing Here the old-timers of Irish and German descent hold on to their pint glasses and wonder what happened to the old neighborhood Still they may buy a drink for the occasional Korean couple who come in

Left-wing filmmaker Michael Moore and CNBC 's Rick Santelli couldn t be more philosophically opposite Style of argument differs too Michael Moore assumes the worst in people that oppose his view In a March 12 appearance on WNYC 93 9 FM /820 AM 's The Brian Lehrer Show Moore was asked to react to Rick Santelli 's February 2009 call for action against the Obama administration proposal to offer a housing relief through the taxpayer to those who got in over their heads on their mortgages Ah the sound of angry white guys wafting its way through the airwaves Moore said Obviously that was a pivotal moment for that but if you notice what he 's railing against is he 's blaming the whole mortgage crisis on the little guy who took out a mortgage he shouldn t have taken out living beyond his means having a home with too many bathrooms when in fact - as my movie points out - the FBI of all people have stated clearly through their own investigation that 80 percent of this mortgage crisis that we ve gone through has been caused by the banks and lending institutions by the fraud committed by the banks and the lending institutions - not by the person who 's living beyond their means 
it 's sunday today reporting from Adelaide weather outside seems to be a little bit chill but not cold as it were yesterday i woke up early this morning after performing my subuh prayer sleep doesn t seem to please me at this very morning then i decided to find something to read luckily it appeared that one religious book entitled Muhammad The Messenger of God amazes me this one fine morning English version as it printed but I managed to catch up with the pace of the way the book describes about Prophet Muhammad all praise to him now it reminds me of how great he were on his era Even the non-Muslims admit to his influence and remarkable power His behavior were the greatest amongst all mankind Al-Ameen which he had been called among his companions and enemies as he was a very truthful man he meant every words he said and never lied about it I 'm ashamed of myself if I reckon myself to his At least I should have acted more matured in every way Stop thinking bad things about other people as what he actually did to his enemy He even prayed for the goodness of his enemies and marked no signs of avenged on his heart It 's a bad of me to getting strayed from the right path of truthfulness and i hope for a better man in me in the near future It 's not worth every seconds wealth or anything valuable than seek forgiveness from Allah the Almighty God This world is only temporary what should we actually seek is the Hereafter which is permanent there i 'm not trying to preach everyone here But as i mentioned i am amazed by the behavior of Prophet Muhammad s a w and i hope to be like him someday Surprise every living organism with full of amazing things I bear witness that there is no God to be worshiped except Allah and I bear witness that Muhammad is the Messenger of God - kalimah shahadah 
If you had to pick the one buzzword that 's dominating social media chatter today it would have to be location Just over a year ago Foursquare burst onto the scene at the SXSW conference in Austin TX Since then it 's only grown dramatically The result has been a battle for domination in the geolocation space While many still think Foursquare could be the next Twitter rivals such as Gowalla ( Gowalla ) are giving the mobile startup some heat and big players such as Facebook ( Facebook ) and Twitter (T witter ) are launching location features or are about to launch them Our own Pete Cashmore sat down with Bloomberg 's Cris Valerio to discuss the location trend the battle brewing between Foursquare ( Foursquare ) and Gowalla at this year 's SXSW the gold mine that is location-based advertising the iPad and even a little bit about the future of Mashable ( Mashable ) It 's quite a fascinating video if you do watch it let us know what you think of the location trend ( and Pete 's on-air performance ) in the comments

If I were to describe the attributes of a smartphone platform to you could you guess which platform it is Let 's try it and see Here 's your first clue Applications for it can only be installed through one specific app store Since everyone has an app store these days I ll give you another hint This phone family doesn t support storage expansion through small memory cards That should rule out a few contenders but let 's take it one step further The operating system doesn t allow third-party applications to run in the background but does allow notifications for these apps to make up for it Think you know now If you answered Apple 's iPhone then you re technically correct but there 's a surprising answer that 's equally correct The phone I am talking about is not an iPhone but the new Microsoft Windows Phone The very same Apple attributes are causing some iPhone critics to say I hate it are as Sacha Segan of PC Magazine notes the same attributes that Microsoft is embracing On the one hand it 's difficult to argue with Apple 's success The total control of hardware and software allows the Cupertino company to offer a consistent end-user experience something that can t be said of Microsoft 's current Windows Mobile handsets With Windows Phone 7 however Microsoft is taking over the overall experience in a very Apple-like way In order to illustrate the similarities between Apple 's iPhone and Microsoft 's Windows Phone 7 approaches let 's look a look at some key attributes among the current and planned smartphone platforms 
My blog has not been updated for quite some time except for the three links and the copied poem that comprise my last four posts There is a lot to write about a lot of things happening light being shed on new things and most important of all I have actually started reading books again A colleague at work with whom I regularly have intellectual discussions suggested that I read Samuel P Huntington 's The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order The title of the book should suggest the kind of topics we discuss if it does not I will - it 's mainly politics and sociology And he even let me borrow his copy of the book So I started reading it about two weeks ago and I have not made much progress It is certainly not the book and its contents that 's keeping me away it is something else I will describe soon what Two months ago while blog-trotting I happened to read As ad Abukhalil 's blog - Angry Arab News Service As I read more and more about him I came to teh conclusion that this was one person who truly believed in what he said He is a socialist and like me firmly believes that one day the land of Palestine will return to its rightful people Browsing through the list of books by the Angry Arab I happened to see the title The Battle for Saudi Arabia - Royalty Fundamentalism and Global Power and some more digging revealed that it dealt with Wahabbism and its hold on the Saudi regime My interest in West Asian politics apart I felt this was a book I want to read Wahabbism has always been a philosophy that frightens me in a way As a member of the Muslim community in Malabar growing up in the 1990 's I have seen and experienced the kind of extreme expression of religion that Wahabbism leads its followers to Think of a brand of Islam that labels all the beliefs and traditions as blasphemy / heresy and says the one and only true religion is this crazy ideology that sprouted in Najd in the 1800 's and grew up in the shade of Saudi petro-dollars I have seen communities divided and heard about Masjid 's being put under Administration because the over-zealous followers of the imported Wahabbism felt that they needed to take over the community in true styles of their original heroes Wahabbism for me is a shade of Islam that is so differerent from the Islam that I have been taught that I grew up surrounded by I saw people practice and I myself have tried to practice The aspect of Islam that is distorted the most by Wahabbism is probably its stress on co-existence and tolerance I knew I had to read this book I went to Landmark at The Forum in Bangalore and placed my order They didn t have a copy in stock so they told me I will have to wait They promised to give me a call when the book arrived Five weeks later I hadn t yet received the call and I had to call them twice to get the book Meanwhile my friend had given me Huntington 's book and I had started reading it But I decided to put it away once I had the Angry Arab 's book So far it has been a very good experience As I turn each page it reinstates in me the belief that I have always held about Wahabbism - that it is a complete contradiction to what Islam teaches and it is plainly wrong The information that As ad has put into his book about the nexus between the Wahabbi theology and the House of Saud is huge I have not yet finished it but hope to finish it in two days Then I plan to read Huntington 's book After that it will be Mappila Muslims of Kerala Society and Anti ColonialStruggles by Dr Hussain Randathani It is published by Other Books Calicut and although I tried I could not get a copy in Bangalore I am still in the hunt for the book I hope to get a copy when I go home for vacation at the end of this month Happened to meet one more socialist The number of socialists I come across at work amazes me Maybe socialism is not all dead and buried after all PS I also read Chetan Bhagath 's 2 States It was the first Chethan Bhagath book that I was reading and contrary to my perception the book turned out to be good 
In our Scamville series of posts last October we exposed the massive user fraud occurring Facebook and MySpace social games Fake quizzes tied to long term mobile subscriptions malware-laden toolbar downloads and other scams were the center of the controversy The industry did a lot of talking in the wake of those posts and some long term changes have been made For the most part for example Fake quizzes and the Video Professor scam are off Facebook ( but see below on what 's still there ) But now we re seeing the same old scams hit the iPhone And the same players particularly OfferPal Media and SuperRewards and now Google are powering those scams Specifically we re seeing SMS-subscription offers which trick users into putting long term subscriptions on their mobile phones ( or their parent 's mobile phones ) New Offerpal CEO George Garrick promised to take a leadership position in cleaning up scammy ads He said It will be a fundamental part of the Offerpal culture that any offers we distribute meet stringent standards of integrity and quality as specified by our partners credible industry experts and good old common sense We ve seen very misleading SMS subscription ads on a variety of applications with Admob ads We ve reached out to Google for their comment Tap Defense an iphone game created by TapJoy contained multiple version of the SMS subscription scam until today The offers were being run by Offerpal After we contacted Offerpal about this story the offers were removed and they gave us the following statement Offerpal and I have done everything we said we would do following the initial social-game offer controversy back in November We quickly adopted strict compliance rules modeled on Facebook 's requirements and we have been working closely with the major social platforms and game developers to ensure that only the highest quality offers have been run and we have succeeded Our offers and other alt pay options have been running continuously and there have been no compliance issues since and these alt-pay offers are many times more popular than cash purchases with social game users Consumers love them and they provide a itional monetization for developers We also led the formation of an IAB standards board to set industry guidelines for lead-gen offers on social networks and Offerpal is the ONLY offer-network who is participating in this effort So the issue of offer quality on social networks has been properly a ressed and is considered by the industry to be an issue of the past Recently we have begun to test offers in a few mobile games and apps in particular on the iPhone Offerpal has been participating in this effort at the request of a couple of iPhone developers and we have also just opened a direct dialogue with Apple to jointly establish standards and guidelines for offers in iPhone apps before any general rollout In the meantime we have been applying the same quidelines that we have been successfully using in Social Games to the few mobile apps that are carrying offers However the vast majority of the offers that are running in iPhone apps are simply installs of other iPhone apps as can be seen for example in Tap Tap Revenge 3 However Mike has raised the question of whether mobile quizzes and other apps resulting in PSMS subscriptions may still not be clear enough in citing their terms since users may not realize they are opting in for an ongoing PSMS subscription Although such quizzes and PSMS offers are currently in wide distribution by most of the major mobile ad networks Mike raises a valid question So in the interest of being conservative and wanting to operate in the best interests of the collective mobile user experience we have immediately removed the quizzes in question and any offers resulting in PSMS subscriptions from distribution pending a further review of the concerns Mike has raised Over the next week or so we will accumulate as much feedback as we can from developers publishers mobile platforms and others in the industry and on Monday March 22 we will publish on our website and via a press release a written statement of our guidelines and policies regarding alt-pay offers in mobile apps George Garrick Chairman and CEO Offerpal 
Are we at a turning point in the Obama presidency It took far too long but the president has belatedly grasped that when the other party is out to destroy you the search for common ground is a fool 's errand For over a year Obama believed that reform required him to govern as a post-ideological bipartisan Now mercifully he has learned that progressive leadership demands taking on the Republicans just as it requires taking on the insurance and banking industries There is little common ground on those fronts either Since early March Obama has begun to sound more like the bold figure who won the hearts of voters during the campaign The showdown is expected late next week Speaker Nancy Pelosi seldom schedules a vote without having a majority in her pocket With all the bill 's deficiencies winning its passage would be a triumph not just for expansion of health coverage but for Obama 's capacity to learn and grow in office and defeat Republican obstruction Should he succeed there will be little public sympathy for Republican caviling about the use of the reconciliation progress to well reconcile differences between the House and Senate bills Technical parliamentary complaints will seem more like the bleating of sore losers Obama can seize the high ground of majority rule 
At the end of this summer of discontent of death panels and unplugging poor Grandma of birthers and astroturfers and rifle-toting picketers the halcyon early days of the Obama administration feel increasingly like hazy gilt-edged memories The president 's sprawling legislative agenda -- a health-care overhaul financial regulation reform slashing wasteful military spending and climate change legislation legislation -- is slowly grinding its way through the halls of Congress Barack Obama 's sheen his administration 's unflagging confidence and all the bipartisan post-racial aspirations have been replaced by the hard realities of Washington politicking And with the media 's lens more tightly focused than ever on Washington 's every move and utterance 24 /7 anything said a few months back feels like a lifetime ago One particular statement from distant April however bears revisiting The president 's chief of staff Rahm Emanuel then grasped not only the magnitude of what was being undertaken but the raft of entrenched interests lining up in opposition As he told the New York Times :\ We re not taking on a fight we re taking on a multiple-front fight because we ve taken on a series of entrenched interests across the waterfront -- from education to health care and the defense industry and the lobbying industry as a whole There will be a scorecard at the end of which ones we won and which ones we didn t but every one of those policy challenges have been initiated by us Never short on chutzpah Emanuel made it clear it was Us vs Them in a 'm ultiple-front fight A 's corecard at the end would determine winners and losers As a candidate on the campaign trail Obama himself regularly decried the undue influence of moneyed interests and lobbyists Announcing his candidacy on February 10 2007 for instance he declared it time to turn the page on the cynics and the lobbyists and the special interests who ve turned our government into a game only they can afford to play And on January 21 2009 the very day he came into office Obama issued one of his first executive orders aiming to limit the influence of lobbyists in the new administration He planned to close the revolving door that lets lobbyists come into government freely and lets them use their time in public service as a way to promote their own interests over the interests of the American people when they leave The new White House stood confident in those early months that it could take on K Street -- a street in the capital notorious for the density of its lobbying firms as well as Washington shorthand for their growing ranks Tallied up today however the administration 's seven-month scorecard tells a different story Just as sweeping as the administration 's packed domestic agenda has been the sheer force with which the lobbying industry and its clients have fought back blocking maligning or undermining its progress In a Washington version of Newton 's third law the president 's actions and those of his allies in Congress have elicited an equal and opposite reaction from opponents -- inside the Beltway and beyond it Spending eye-popping sums of money deploying armies of lobbyists dispatching grassroots foot soldiers as agents of disruption the special interests have fought fiercely to derail the White House reform agenda It 's now apparent that Obama and his advisers including Rahm Emanuel underestimated their strength Even if Congress were to move in all four areas targeted for reform the concessions already made the softening of prospective regulations and restrictions would likely signal a series of genuine victories for those special interests 
The United States Government has shown its commitment to support the development of a new generation of uclear power plant ( NGNP Next Generation Nuclear Plant ) that is more secure and safe World Nuclear News dated March 9 2010 reported that two groups of technologies each headed by General Atomics and Westinghouse have been asked to complete the conceptual design and make detailed plans to build the NGNP he United States Government announced it would provide a total funding of 40 million to support both teams in the completion of their conceptual designs and plans for a NGNP until the end of August this year General Atomic team has suggested the GT-MHR ( Gas Turbine Modular Helium Reactor ) involving the Korean Atomic Energy Research Institute ( KAERI ) and Fuji Electric Systems Meanwhile the Westinghouse team will make the PBMR concept supported by PBMR Ltd Shaw Group Thosiba Doosan Insight Technology and M-Tech Industrial Both designs will use nuclear fuel kernels coated with uranium oxide and covered with layers of carbon and carbides In the GT-MHR kernels will be hexagonal blocks arranged in a compact terrace while in the PBMR kernels will be compiled in the form of balls in the larger terrace Both will be cooled by using helium gas with a temperature of 850 degrees Celsius When the conceptual design is completed this event will mark the completion of Phase I of the NGNP project Phase II will begin with a selection followed by design development and construction for the NGNP planned for Idaho The United States government 's latest statement mentioned that the combined construction and operation license may be submitted to the regulator in 2013 with construction beginning in 2017 and operation in 2021

I got back last week from a great vacation in Maui visiting Anna Mom and I went together and we spent the week sleeping on Anna 's porch (s o lovely ) hanging out on the Pacific Whale Foundation boat with Anna and watching whales and watching the third season of Arrested Development while drinking gin tonics ( a must-do activity for any hawaiian vacation ) After about the first hour of vacation I re-remembered that Anna is a much better photographer than I am - so I packed my camera away for the rest of the trip and am using only her pictures for my blog posts =) She gave me about 270 pics on a CD and while I 'm not going to post all of them even the weeded out assortment will take some time to post here so I 'm going to put up pictures in phases Here is a collection of my favorite whale pics that Anna sent me - they are not necessarily from the week we were there but we did see all of these activities happen while we were out on the boat 
A few days ago Ken Cuccinelli Virginia 's new conservative Republican attorney general advised the state 's public colleges that they don t have the authority to ban discrimination based on sexual orientation saying only the General Assembly has that power producing a stampede of criticism not only from the usual suspects but also others who are not reflexively anti-Republican On March 9th the Washington Post reported More than 3 000 people joined the Facebook page We Don t Want Discrimination In Our State Universities And Colleges Nearly 1 000 people joined another started by activists at the College of William and Mary The University of Virginia group Queer Allied Activism urged students to protest on Cuccinelli 's Facebook page and on Twitter Students at Virginia Commonwealth University one of the few in the state not on break planned a rally for noon Wednesday with several hundred students committed At Christopher Newport University student Republican and Democratic leaders will discuss their next steps at a bipartisan meeting Friday I ve never gotten so many e-mails from students wanting to do something said Brandon Carroll 21 president of the student government at Virginia Tech He said any erosion in gay rights at state universities is going to make us lose top students It 's going to make us lose top faculty 
Every time before this on occasion of New Year 's I wrote on the 31st of December wishing you in advance I was going to do the same this time too However something came to me and told me No Think again Those words were way too much to handle profound and simple in their entirety Uninvited they changed my mentality to an extent that I had no other option but to write today -- the first day of the new year But you know what su en change is like don t you It seems asinine especially in the beginning Like a minor viral infection that pierces through the immune system you can only hear it like the snow that touches the ground And if you pay close attention to that sound it just seems crazy But like su en change that sound starts blaring like songs at an Indian we ing And that 's when you realize you have no option but to listen to it Unless you have noise canceling headphones that is Also like that very snow the voice that told me to Think again was not a voice at all In fact it was an absence of it Okay enough mumbo-jumbo My internet connection died yesterday So happy new year today 
Microsoft faces a tough assignment in trying to get back in the smartphone game Nokia 's Symbian maintains a massive presence in overseas markets while Apple 's iPhone and Google 's Android have gained tremendous momentum in the superphone era And Windows Mobile will only continue to lose ground in advance of the debut of Windows Phone later this year thanks to the fact that the two platforms will be incompatible But there 's no shortage of players hoping that Redmond can breathe new life into its mobile business The following are just a few of the entities with a vested interest in seeing Windows Phone succeed * Corporate IT departments Business users are increasingly turning to consumer-friendly smartphones like the iPhone and forcing IT staffers to support their new gadgets But the emergence of a phone that offers both Microsoft 's seamless integration with Exchange Server and consumer-friendly features and applications would go a long way toward making life easier for IT workers * HTC The Taiwan-based handset manufacturer is fully aboard the Android bandwagon but hitching your wagon to a single OS is a dangerous strategy for a mobile OEM So the longtime Windows Mobile supplier is one of the launch partners for Windows Phone and vows to develop an HTC Hub for the platform * Motorola Although it joined the Android crowd late last year in a big way releasing both the Cliq and the Droid as Om noted in January Motorola was left out in the cold when HTC was tapped to produce Google 's flagship device The struggling company will continue to churn out Android handsets but Windows Phone has caught its eye Look for increasing interest and maybe a hardware commitment out of Motorola as the OS nears its launch later this year * Application developers Microsoft is wooing developers by forcing manufacturers to comply with strict guidelines regarding screen sizes buttons and features That will make it easier for developers to deploy apps across a range of Windows Phone gadgets without having to tweak each app for each handset And longtime Windows Mobile developers are sure to be pleased by a platform that combines high-tech entertainment features with Microsoft 's business-focused technology * Gamers Integrating Windows Phone with Xbox and Windows is an interesting move for a company whose mobile strategy has long focused on the enterprise But it 's also a strategy that could finally push mobile gaming beyond casual pick-up-and-play titles and toward more immersive console-type experiences 
So far no international classification for hotels exists but that hasn t stopped ambitious hotel marketers from slapping any number of stars diamonds or cacti on their properties and touting them as 5- 6- or even 7-star properties whatever that may mean in real service and amenities I think the ratings inflation trend began with the Xanadu-like building frenzy in Dubai especially with the luxury hotel Burj Al Arab (T ower of the Arabs ) built on an artificial island and billed as a 7-star stay by the the Dubai government 's Development and Investment Office conomy Wikipedia says there are only three seven-star hotels in the world (T own House Galleria in Milan the Burj and Emirates Palace in Abu Dhabi ) but that hasn t stopped Drake and Cavendish Luxury Hotel and Travel Guide From publishing its list of Six Star hotels here 's when we say this is hotel rating inflation bordering on fraud We re told though we can t confirm it that one so-called six star resort actually offers a poolside valet to polishguests sunglasses and eliminate all that pesky poolside humidity But a Mobil Travel Guide official told us that when you achieve five stars that 's perfection Forget the other hype he said One reviewer in Norway stayed at the self-designated Six Star Ai Bahia Principe Costa Adeje Spain and went on to say the hotel lacked room service but who cares the reviewer said because you re asleep during the night anyway 
It may not be illegal to tuck your kids into bed via iChat while taking advantage of United 's in-flight WiFi but that didn t stop a flight attendant from ending John Battelle 's ( admittedly precious ) use of the service during a flight two days ago It seems that the airline has a policy that prohibits two-way devices from communicating with the ground -- you know in case some terrorists board the plane and try some shenanigans Apparently a laptop with WiFi isn t considered a two-way device until you throw videoconferencing apps like Skype into the mix Somehow it seems the company missed Apple iChat when blocking ports thus enabling the whole affair Let this be a lesson to those of you with children save the chats for the hotel room or the airport lobby eh 
To date President Obama 's nominations to key defense postings have been mostly pragmatic starting at the top with the retention of Secretary Gates However in the instance of Philip Coyle -- nominated to fill the associate director of national security and international affairs spot in the Office of Science and Technology Policy-- the administration whiffed Coyle a long time opponent of ballistic missile defense (d ating back to Reagan 's SDI days ) is an ideologue whose appointment could prove harmful to U S security Coyle claims that missile defense is a theology not a technology He 's argued steadily that BMD systems are useless against countermeasures like chaff and maneuverable warheads and that testing failures in certain systems renders the technology obsolete In 2006 just prior to North Korea test firing a volley of ballistic missiles Coyle wrote The ground-based system hasn t had a successful flight intercept test in four years In the two most recent attempts the interceptor never got off the ground and failed to leave its silo And in the only other recent attempt the kill vehicle - the pointy-end of the interceptor - failed to separate from its booster and missed its target A question the press might ask President Bush is So long as you resist face-to-face meetings with North Korea aren t you just giving them more time to develop a missile that can reach the U S Or to put it differently Mr President which do you think will take longer North Korea to develop a missile that can reach the U S Or the U S to develop a missile defense we can rely on A fair question Despite an aggressive long range missile program North Korea has yet to launch a missile that can reach Hawaii much less the continental United States Meanwhile there have been successful tests of the RIM-161 SM-3 interceptor the airborne laser the ground-based mid course interceptor and the theater high-altitude area defense system But instead of retracting after completely misreading North Korean v U S development capabilities he switched tactics claiming in House testimony that deterrence assures us that North Korea would never attack the south Japan or the United States In the same testimony Coyle -- despite a series of successful tests -- clung to the very same talking point he used almost a decade earlier -- that BMD is questionable technology which isn t worth the money or resources 
Vodafone has shuttered Wayfinder just 16 months after spending 30 million to acquire the Swedish navigational software firm The move underscores just how drastically the mobile navigation market has changed in the last year thanks to the emergence of free services from third-party developers It 's also a sign that U S operators won t be able to continue charging customers extra for navigation for much longer Navigation has been a lucrative space for carriers such as Verizon Wireless and Sprint both of whom continue to offer GPS-based services for 3 a day or 10 a month Vodafone had acquired Wayfinder in an effort to create a suite of new location-based services and keep pace with third-party developers such as Google and Nokia But both Google and Nokia have made their offerings free in the last few months giving consumers turn-by-turn directions and other goodies for no charge beyond the cost of mobile data So Vodafone will ditch its effort to develop its own products and look to partner with third parties for location services that it can offer for free And that 's a clear indication that U S carriers looking to monetize their branded navigation services will have to find a way to do it without dinging their customers for a itional monthly charges 
Well shoulder surgery was a success for the Doctor He told Christina that I would be happy I did it Well I 'm still waiting for that joy to overtake me LOL It 's now been 4 1 /2 weeks since the surgery and I 'm just now able to do any type of strength exercises Now don t get too excited for me The band that I 'm using is almost like trying to stretch a small rubber band It was very depressing to see the difference in my arms when doing rows in front of the mirror I 'm very ansy to get back onto a strict routine but in the same sense I want to remain as patient as possible so I don t re-damage my shoulder I have set some fitness goals this year and they include a lot of cycling I will be doing the Hotter Than Hell 100 Ride in Wichita Falls TX in August which I feel is a good goal for me with the timing of being able to hit training at the right time And then after it I want to do a Sprint Triathlon and possibly a half marathon The latter two will require me to learn to run distance I grew up a sprinter and never had to run further than 600 meters other than pre-season which really didn t count But that 's just part of meeting the goals I will be doing a lot of easy upper body and honestly look forward to hitting the One on One Fountain of Youth Yoga Christina is hitting P90X hard again which is awesome and I love that she 's pressing forward she 's amazing She has been asked to speak to a group at our church on fitness and P90X / Beachbody products so all is good Hope everyone 's goals this year are lofty and full of fitness Please let me know what I can do to help 
The problem with all of these people who are walking out the door at MySpace isn t so much the number of them because MySpace is trying to replace them by hiring more people It 's the fact that the best people are leaving and taking a lot of the knowledge base with them Three star senior employees left to go to cross-town startup Gravity we reported earlier this week And tonight we ve heard that Jeff Webber the engineering director that oversees the email instant messaging and other communications platforms for MySpace resigned earlier this week as well to join a startup He 's been at MySpace for nearly three years and was one of the star engineers and leaders says one source Other recent departures VP and General Manager of Mobile John Faith SVP User Experience Katie Geminder and most of her team And of course CEO Owen Van Natta And lots more as well only a few of which we ve reported The company has no direction says everyone we talk to at MySpace except the top execs and internal politics are the only thing that seem to matter Ambitious new projects like Remaking MySpace have been thrown away just because the wrong exec supported it Anyone who actually wants to build products has left or is looking for a new job say many many sources If you re a MySpace employee and feel differently please contact us anonymously Because right now all we see is a ton of fluff and absurdity coming from the top and massive morale problems at the mi le management ranks The title of this post is actually a recent quote from a ( now former ) MySpace employee and it seems to be accurate They say a company has to hit rock bottom before it can even think about rebuilding into something new If that 's the case the time to start rebuilding is apparently right about now But in our opinion MySpace has no chance at all until it is free of the News Corp death grip 
New research reported this week in the journal Regenerative Medicine points to new directions for creating therapeutic stem cells from adult cells a technique that has many possibilities for treatment of human diseases Applying this technique may also lead to treatments directly applying to diseases of aging The paper ( available here [PD F ]) by authors from BioTime Inc a California research company demonstrates a new method that helps confirm the telomere hypothesis of cell aging The telomere hypothesis suggests that a part of the chromosome called a telomere is the clock that counts the cell 's age One of the problems that has plagued research into so-called adult stem cells is that while it 's possible to make therapeutic stem cells from adult cells these cells act old Unlike embryonic stem cells they can t replicate as many times they die out quickly Chromosomes are simply collections of DNA molecules that contain the genetic code used to build the proteins that become the body 's tissues A chromosome is really a sequence of codons which are like the letters in a coded message like a teletype message 
What looked like a drizzle last night seems to be turning into a full on downpour The folks over at BlackBerry Leaks have gotten themselves even more facetime with that mysterious BlackBerry slider device -- and it looks a lot better than we thought Right now the theories are flying about just exactly what kind of phone this is with BBL suggesting it might be the next phone in the Storm family while Kevin over at CrackBerry has it on good authority that this new handset will be part of the Bold line Kevin also says that the rumors he 's heard on this device call for a 360 x 480 touchscreen display (s ans SurePress ) and expectations for BlackBerry OS 6 0 to be onboard The pictured phone apparently has a battery issue which is keeping it from powering up but hopefully someone will find a way to spark this thing to life and we can get some more solid info For now check out one more pic after the break 
American society appears to be undergoing a crisis in trust Most of the major organizations that we depend upon including governments of all types corporations our health care system our financial institutions and our schools all seem to be failing us Indeed I do not believe it is an exaggeration to claim that our society is actually undergoing a disintegration process whereby the fundamental premises and values supporting our institutions are all being called into question While such disintegration is of course very painful to experience it is also a tremendous opportunity for genuine transformation My essay will attempt to outline some of the most important values and strategies necessary for the creation of and the transformation to high trust organizations Higher Purpose Virtually all of our societal organizations seem to have either forgotten or have never really known why they exist and what their higher purposes are Instead they have often elevated narrow individual and institutional self-interest into the only purposes that they recognize as valid Our governments all too frequently serve the politicians and the public service unions rather than their citizens Our schools too often serve their educational bureaucracy and teachers unions instead of their students and their parents Our health care system too often seeks to maximize the profits of pharmaceutical companies hospitals doctors and insurance companies rather than the health and wellness of patients Many of our corporations primarily exist to maximize the compensation of their executives and secondarily shareholder value rather than value creation for customers employees and other major stakeholders The single most important requirement for the creation of higher levels of trust for any organization is to discover or rediscover the higher purpose of the organization Why does the organization exist What is it trying to accomplish What core values will inspire the organization and create greater trust from all of its stakeholders While there are potentially as many different purposes as there are organizations I believe that great organizations have great purposes The highest ideals that humans aspire to should be the same ideals that our organizations also have as their highest purposes These include such timeless ideals as The Good Service to others--improving health education communication and the quality of life Southwest Airlines Nordstroms The Container Store Amazon com and Joie de Vivre Hospitality are examples of this great purpose The True Discovery furthering human knowledge Google Intel Genentech and Wikipedia all express this higher aspiration The Beautiful Excellence the creation of beauty Apple and Berkshire Hathaway share this ideal in their own unique ways The Heroic Courage to do what is right to change improve the world Grameen Bank and the Gates Foundation express this higher purpose in their actions Organizations that place these higher purposes at the very core of their business model tend to inspire trust from all of their major stakeholders customers employees investors suppliers and the larger communities that they exist in Higher purpose and shared core values tend to unify the organization behind their fulfillment and usually act to pull the overall organization upwards to a higher degree ethical commitment Higher levels of trust are a natural result of this unity of purpose shared core values and greater ethical commitment Conscious Leadership -- Walking the Walk Next to the power of higher purpose nothing is more important for creating high levels of organizational trust than the quality and commitment of the leadership at all levels of the organization It doesn t matter if an organization has a higher purpose if the leadership doesn t understand it and seek to serve it The various stakeholders of an organization especially employees and customers look to the leadership to walk-the-talk --to serve the purpose and mission of the organization and to lead by example It is especially important that the CEO and other senior leadership embody the higher purpose of the organization As the co-founder and CEO of Whole Foods Market I 'm the most visible person in the company One of the most important parts of my job is touring our stores and talking to our team members customers and suppliers I know that in virtually everything that I say and do our team members are always studying me trying to determine whether they can trust me and the mission of the company I 'm always on stage So walking the talk is very important I try to communicate the mission and values of Whole Foods at every opportunity and I try to live those core values myself with complete fidelity Fidelity to the mission and values builds trust while any deviance undermines it High trust organizations and hypocritical leadership are mutually exclusive Teams Everywhere Human beings evolved in relatively small tribal bands Many scientific studies have indicated that our ability to maintain close trusting relationships with family friends and co-workers is constrained to probably not more than about 150 people We can of course know many more people than this but it is hard to know them well enough to develop close bonds of trust based on actual experiences At Whole Foods we recognize the importance of smaller tribal groupings to maximize familiarity and trust We organize our stores and company into a variety of interlocking teams Most teams have between 6 and 100 team members and the larger teams are subdivided further into a variety of sub-teams The leaders of each team are also members of the Store Leadership Team and the Store Team Leaders are members of the Regional Leadership Team This interlocking team structure continues all the way upwards to the Executive Team at the highest level of the company It has been our experience at Whole Foods that trust is optimized in this type of smaller team organizational structure This is because each person is a vital and important member of their teams The success of the team is dependent upon the invaluable contributions of everyone on the team Trust is optimized when it flows between all levels within the organization Many leaders make the mistake of believing that the key to increasing organizational trust is to somehow get the work force to trust the leadership more While this is obviously very important it is equally important that the leadership trust the workforce To receive trust it is usually necessary that we give trust Organizing into small interlocking teams helps ensure that trust will flow in all directions within the organization -- upwards downwards within the team and across teams Empowerment = Trust While small teams are essential to optimizing the flow of organizational trust equally important is the philosophy of empowerment The effectiveness of teams is tremendously enhanced when they are fully empowered to do their work and to fulfill the organization 's mission and values Empowerment must be much much more than a mere slogan however It should be within the very DNA of the organization Empowerment unleashes creativity and innovation and rapidly accelerates the evolution of the organization Empowered organizations have tremendous competitive advantage because they have tapped into levels of energy and commitment which their competitors usually have difficulty matching Nothing holds back empowerment more than the leadership philosophy of command and control Command and control ( C C ) is actually the opposite of empowerment and it greatly lessens trust C C usually involves detailed rules and bureaucratic structures to enforce the rules Such detailed rules almost always inhibit innovation and creativity People get ahead in the organization not through being innovative but by following the rules and playing it safe C C may produce compliance from the workforce but it seldom unleashes much energy or passion for the purpose of the organization Empowerment = Trust C C = Lack of Trust The Importance Of Transparency and Authentic Communication A very important measurement and condition of trust is transparency If we want to optimize trust then we must seek to optimize transparency When we decide to keep something hi en the motivation is almost always a lack of trust We are afraid that the information that we wish to hide would cause more harm than good if it were widely known While of course some discretion is usually necessary to protect important organizational information from migrating to one 's competitors or to outsiders who wish to harm the organization such discretion can easily be overdone Transparency is a very important supporting value for empowerment Indeed it is difficult for an organization to be empowered if it lacks transparency Whole Foods Market strives to optimize transparency to all of our stakeholders Authentic communication with honesty and integrity are essential attributes of both transparency and trust This is the exact opposite of what many organizations do which is to try to 's pin their messaging to tell people what they believe people want to hear so that people will think well of them This lack of honest authentic communication and transparency usually boomerangs however and undermines trust and creates cynicism One of the main reasons why Americans don t trust many political leaders including the various Presidents that have led us is that we discover that they routinely lie to us They don t tell us the truth and we come to understand that they don t trust us and feel that they need to manipulate us We tell the truth to people that we trust The high-trust organization takes the risk of revealing too much information We must be willing to take the risk that some valuable information may fall into the wrong hands because our commitment to empowerment and trust necessitates taking that risk Creating transparency and authentic communication is an ongoing challenge that every organization faces We must continually strive to remove the barriers that prevent it knowing that we can t maintain high levels of organizational trust without it Fairness in All Things Nothing unravels trust more quickly in an organization than either the reality or the perception of unfairness Another important virtue of creating a culture of transparency is that it helps ensure that unfairness is clearly seen and can therefore be corrected quickly It is essential that the ethic of fairness apply to all key organizational processes such as hiring promotion compensation discipline and termination Favoritism and nepotism undermine organizational trust They cannot be tolerated People are often prone to envy and any perceived unfairness exacerbates this tendency greatly giving it the energy of justification Creating a Culture of Love and Care Ultimately we cannot create high trust organizations without creating cultures based on love and care The people we usually trust the most are the people that we also believe genuinely love and care for us All too often love and care are not qualities that we associate with organizations We tend to look for love and friendship with our families and friends but not from our work Why is this Many people believe that love and care in the organizational setting interfere with efficiency and get in the way of making the tough but necessary decisions that the organization requires for success This type of thinking reflects our own lack of integration of love and care in our own lives We have created an artificial barrier that is holding back our own personal growth and the full potential of our organizations Fear is the opposite of love When fear predominates in the organization love and care cannot flourish The opposite is also true--love and care banish fear How can we create more love and care in our organizations To answer this would require another essay and perhaps even an entire book After discovering the higher organizational purpose nothing is more important than encouraging and nurturing love and care Here are a few suggestions that will hopefully stimulate further thinking on this incredibly important goal of creating more love and care in our organizations The leadership must embody genuine love and care This cannot be faked If the leadership doesn t express love and care in their actions then love and care will not flourish in the organization As Gandhi said :\ We must be the change that we wish to see in the world We must give permission for love and care to be expressed in the organization Many organizations are afraid of love and care and force them to remain hi en Love and care will flow naturally when we give them permission and encourage them We should consider the virtues of love and care in all of our leadership promotion decisions We shouldn t just promote the most competent but also the most loving and caring Our organizations need both and we should promote leaders who embody both Cultivate forgiveness rather than judgment and condemnation Too many organizations believe that judgment of others and criticizing failures are essential for creating excellence While striving for excellence is important for all organizations this can be done at a higher level of consciousness without condemnation Forgiveness doesn t mean condoning mistakes and failures It simply means that we help the other person to learn from their mistakes through non-judgmental feedback and encouragement End all your organizational meetings with appreciations This is something that Whole Foods Market has been doing for about 25 years now with wonderful results for spreading love and care Give everyone participating in the meeting the opportunity to voluntarily appreciate and thank other members in the group for services they have contributed or qualities that are admired This one simple cultural practice of appreciating our fellow team members moves us out of judgment and fear into the consciousness of love Conclusion We have the opportunity to create more conscious and higher trust organizations in the 21st century To do so will require three major changes First the organization must become conscious of what its higher purposes are Without consciousness of higher purposes organizations will not reach their fullest potential because the creative energy within the organization will not be fully expressed Secondly we ll need our leaders to evolve to higher levels of consciousness and trust themselves We will not be able to create high trust organizations without more conscious and high trust leaders Less conscious leaders will tend to hold their organizations back Thirdly we will need to evolve the cultures of our organization in ways that create processes strategies and structures that encourage higher levels of trust These will necessarily include the important ideals of teams empowerment transparency authentic communication fairness love and care 
After delivering a GDC panel on his cinematic inspiration we met with Metroid Other M producer Yoshio Sakamoto to ask him about everything from collaborating with Team Ninja lessons learned from Metroid Prime the newfound focus on story in the Metroid universe and whether or not he played Chair 's Super Metroid love letter Shadow Complex Read on Can you tell us about the process of working with Team Ninja Who does what design-wise and technology-wise Yoshio Sakamoto The original design concept came from me but then we went and assembled a team that could pull this off And in this case it was people from Team Ninja who we really thought was the best fit But they ve also provided a lot of core ideas that have influenced the direction of the game particularly the director Mr Hayashi So as I mentioned in the speech today it 's not so much that we re dividing up tasks but collaborating as equals After E3 and the initial announcement a lot of people were making comments like Oh it seems like they ve dumped Retro for this series and they want to go with another developer as if it was a big switch-off But in actuality that is far from the case rather we just wanted to put together the best team that we could to make this project which turns out to be Project M Gallery Metroid Other M Retro obviously produced the Metroid Prime series very successful very influential Do you consider this a reboot of the series after Metroid Prime Is this the direction for future Metroids or just another direction The games that I ve been involved with in the Metroid series have been on the NES GameBoy Super NES and the GBA I actually didn t have a lot of input on the Prime series But when they re doing with Other M here it 's not so much a different universe it 's just a different part of the story You can t say that there 's no relation here it 's probably best to think of them as being in parallel in this world What if anything has the team learned from Prime I ve been working on 2D Metroid games all the way up until now so when we had a chance to see the Prime games which su enly take the series to the 3D space we realized people found it to have a really good visual impact and they really did want that kind of enhanced visual experience And so I have to say I 'm certainly influenced by people 's desires in that direction There are some points in Other M that are going to feel a bit like the Prime series in terms of the visual experience they offer But what we re really trying to do is bring the ease of play you found in the 2D series forward But certainly Prime was a very cool series and we ve taken some notes there Seeing as how Prime had a very Western focus Other M is a really good intro to the Metroid universe is Other M intended to revitalize the Metroid franchise in Japan I have to say we re definitely thinking globally We want to drive the elements that people have really attached fondness to in the Metroid series And so we re actively working to find out what people want but we re not just thinking about the ideas of gamers in Japan We re definitley thinking about everyone Will there be any online component to Other M And if not why isn t online a priority There 's no online functionality in this title and the reason for that is that Other M does not rely on that as one of the core design ideas They re thinking more about the single-player style that you ve seen in all Metroid games up until this point And one of the specific goals here is to convey the charm of Samus as a character and to bring forth several perspectives on what kind of personality she has and how she reacts to situations So online wouldn t really factor into that kind of character development as a core idea If they were going to design a Metroid game with an online functionality it really would ve had to have come in at the ground floor when they come up with the design of the game The understanding of the Metroid world is not something you can really take for granted among every single gamer out there There are some people who are new to this series and some people who ve been with it for a long time So one of the first tasks is to bring everyone up to the same level of understanding in the Metroid universe And this game focuses as a really good intro as well as a really good new challenge to that world Once you raise the level of awareness of what the Metroid universe is like then you can start to think about bringing completely new gameplay ideas that haven t been present before 
Presence-enabled communities will be the primary market driver behind mobile demand for Web 2 0 applications and services that will generate 18 9 billion in 2014 according to figures released this morning from Juniper Research Carriers will have a chance to tap into that market if they can effectively evolve beyond their traditional role as network operators As loosely defined by Juniper mobile Web 2 0 features the web as a platform for applications and the user as both creator and consumer of content That broad definition includes offerings such as mobile Skype as well as basic chat services social networks and location-aware services such as Foursquare and Gowalla that feature community A combination of ads data charges and premium services will be among the key revenue streams Juniper said The market for mobile Web 2 0 is one that AT T is trying to tap with Buzz com a new Yelp-like social recommendations site that will likely embrace presence management as it matures (T he offering which is aimed at helping users find the right local business based on reviews from friends and family launched in January and is in closed alpha ) The problem for operators though will be in getting their apps in the hands of users on other networks That 's an entirely new strategy for carriers which have long deployed products and services solely to attract new subscribers and hold on to the customers they already have If AT T or any of its competitors can make a go of it they could tap an entirely new business model beyond merely being mobile network operators

On Sunday 's Newsroom CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin disputed the conclusion of the Los Angeles Times on the apparently shocking new political initiative of Clarence Thomas 's wife Virginia Thomas that it could give rise to conflicts of interest for her husband as it tests the norms for judicial spouses Toobin defended Mrs Thomas grassroots conservative work Anchor Don Lemon brought on the senior legal analyst just before the bottom of the 10 pm Eastern hour to discuss Kathleen Hennessey 's article in the Sunday L A Times titled Justice 's wife launches tea party group The Times writer indicated that Mrs Thomas new organization somehow risked the partiality of the Court as indicated in the article 's subtitle The nonprofit run by Virginia Thomas wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas is likely to test notions of political impartiality for the court She continued later that the move by Virginia Thomas 52 into the front lines of politics stands in marked contrast to the rarefied culture of the nation 's highest court which normally prizes the appearance of nonpartisanship and a distance from the fisticuffs of the politics of the day Story Continues Below Ad Hennessey also cited expert on legal ethics Stephen Gillers of NYU who advised Justice Thomas to be on alert for possible conflicts particularly those involving donors to his wife 's nonprofit There is opportunity for mischief if a company with a case before the court or which it wants the court to accept makes a substantial contribution to Liberty Central in the interim Toobin who over two years earlier accused Justice Thomas of displaying a distinct solicitude for employers over employees for government over individuals for corporations over regulators and for executioners over the condemned in his term on the Supreme Court actually brushed aside such concerns citing Mrs Thomas long involvement in politics He only raised the issue of whether it 's good judgment and whether it 's a appropriate thing to do Read more http // newsbusters org / blogs / matthew-balan /2010/03/15/ jeff-toobin-disagrees-l-times-mrs-clarence-thomas-activism ixzz0iPSUuEu3 
In 1959 a strapping young Trinidadian named Mike Quashie emigrated to New York and helped ignite the limbo dance craze He became a darling of the city 's society set a fixture of the downtown fashion scene and a sort of left-field rock icon In the 1960s Mr Quashie 's troupe included a dancer named Jean Lee fresh to New York from her hometown of Atlantic City Mr Quashie took her under his wing for a few years until they went their separate ways and lost touch Last year Mr Quashie left his longtime apartment in Greenwich Village for an assisted-living residence in the Bronx He had no family around him no money few visitors While other residents displayed chipper family photographs Mr Quashie put up a faded snapshot from his Apollo days His old carnival masks hung next to his walker But su enly there in the home full of strangers he saw a face from the old days someone who knew this man before his magnificent body had gone soft and slow before his back and his knees became shot from the strain of the limbo It was Ms Lee Her dancing days long behind her she was now a psychiatric nurse at this very home When she came in the room to say hello I just completely flipped out Mr Quashie 79 said the other day I said I don t believe that I 'm in a home and here 's Jean Ms Lee 72 said that Mr Quashie 's name jumped out at her when she heard a list of new admissions I said Wait a minute is he from Trinidad she recalled I said Send him to me That 's someone I know very well and that I d take care of him Susan Quist a friend of Mr Quashie who handles many of his affairs said Mr Quashie 's social workers selected the Bronx home a residence near Fordham Road operated by Jewish Home Lifecare from a list that she requested for him It 's a minor miracle that his paths crossed with Ms Lee she said Jean sings his praises around that place and shares his stories He 's the big man on campus there now

A week ago the Houston Cougars were in a bad way Aubrey Coleman the team 's star forward and the leading scorer in all of Division I scored 38 points Unfortunately it was too little too late as the Cougars erased a 17 point deficit but still lost 79-76 A to that the fact that the loss came against Tulane a team that had lost 14 of their last 16 games The loss was Houston 's fourth in their last six games and certainly their most demoralizing It quickly turned them from a team with a chance to a team just hoping to not embarrass themselves in the Conference USA Tournament They got an easy win to open the tournament making sure to show up in a blowout win over lowly East Carolina That only earned them a date with regular season runner-up Memphis Sure Memphis was their last truly impressive win (92-75) but that was more than two weeks prior Somehow the Cougars held on to beat Memphis by one 66-65 then Southern Mississippi It led them to a shot at the conference title and an automatic tournament bid but it also meant facing the C-USA regular season champion the University of Texas-El Paso (UT EP ) With five minutes left in the game Coleman - he of the 26 points per game to lead the country was having a truly awful day shooting 2-of-17 from the field Fortunately for him his teammate Kelvin Lewis - the only other Cougar to average more than eight points per game in the regular season - caught fire At that same point in time Lewis has 25 points on 10-of-13 shooting including five three-pointers and the Cougars were down 67-64 after a pair of UTEP free throws Later Lewis earned his last points of the game with one last long-range shot and after a timeout Houston made another three to give themselves a 74-70 lead UTEP only made one basket in the last two minutes and now Houston is the C-USA champion for the first time in 18 years Some might view them as a one-and-done type team but with the nation 's leading scorer and now a second player in Lewis that defenses must respect the Cougars just might make some noise when the Madness continues next week 
Twitter founder Evan Williams was widely expected to announce an advertising platform at the SXSW conference but while he announced something with dozens of major media partners it wasn t an ad platform it was something called anywhere And what is anywhere Good question In fact that 's just one of the many good questions that attendees hoped in vain would be asked by Umair Haque of Harvard Business Review whose interviewing skills received less-than-critical acclaim during and after the keynote The official Twitter blog entry about the launch of anywhere isn t much help when it comes to answering the question of what the new service is or at least it 's not as much help as you might expect it to be what with this being one of the most hotly awaited SXSW keynotes in recent memory The blog post describes the service as recreating the kind of open engaging interactions between users that Twitter provides but integrating that into any web site through Javascript and thus providing a new layer of value for visitors without sending them to Twitter com And that 's pretty much it No descriptions of what this might involve no screenshots of what it might look like ( although the Los Angeles Times seems to have whipped up its own ) just some logos of partners like eBay and Yahoo and Digg The way Twitter has described it anywhere will allow readers of articles at the New York Times and other sites to click and follow writers directly from their bylines and judging by what Evan Williams told Anil Dash on Twitter will also let them click and see information about popular Twitter users who are mentioned on a participating site by way of a popup window triggered by mousing over a link similar to the hover popups at Twitter com Embe ed below is a video clip that Kirsten Cluthe of MediaBistro shot of the Twitter founder describing how sites will use anywhere 
It 's incredible what you can learn from television these days On Saturday Brent Frazier of Nashville 's CBS affiliate reported on a local Coffee Party He made no mention of the attendance but at about 2 06 of the video says The Coffee Party though very much still in the organizing phase is loosely based on smaller government and lower taxes I have to wonder how the newshound came to that conclusion Was it because the group 's founder as noted by NewsBuster Matthew Balan worked as a volunteer for Barack Obama 's presidential campaign Or maybe it was the Reuters acknowledgment that America 's conservative Tea Party movement may be on the boil but the left is brewing up its own version in The Coffee Party USA Or perhaps it was the Coffee Party participant Frazier interviewed who volunteered for Obama but is now disillusioned because they (D emocrats ) speak an agenda but as soon as it 's challenged they back down Obama 's just not pushing left hard enough With reporting skills like that one thing is clear Brent has a very bright future in the mainstream media Read more http // newsbusters org / blogs / mike-bates /2010/03/14/ tv-reporter-coffee-party-loosely-based-smaller-government-and-lower-taxe ixzz0iPMZosMs

Well Here 's an album that should require no introduction for those of you who grew up or reached prime headbanging age during the grunge 90s Houdini was The Melvins first album for major label Atlantic and came out at a time when many alternative rock bands were riding the crest of the post-Nirvana wave In fact long-time friend of The Melvins and scene prince Kurt Cobain shares a producer credit on the album and even lends instrumentation on two of its tracks Amazing how these things work out considering The Melvins were one of the originators of the heavy metal-punk hybrid that came to be known as the Seattle Sound First to wail and among the last to get a big record deal I listened to this album on Grooveshark the other night for what had to be the first time in over 10-12 years Just as awesome as I remembered it and I was surprised to find that I remembered most of the songs ( I never owned a copy and was usually pulling this one out of my friends collections ) This 14 song version seems to be pulled from a Japanese CD release which includes the MC5 cover Rocket Reducer No 62 Rather than wade through a track-by-track highlight reel let me just assure you that this album rocks heavily and should have you banging your head in no time You may run out of steam by the time you get to the latter part of the record with its more difficult noisy percussion tracks Still the surprising catchiness and monster riffs of Houdini 's earlier tunes along with the faithfully executed MC5 closer may leave you wondering if it 's actually legal for one band to kick so much ass 
Glenn Beck says Christians should leave churches that use the word 's ocial justice He says social justice is a code word for communism and Nazism But since the Catholic Church the Black Churches the Mainline Protestant churches more and more Evangelical and Pentecostal churches including Hispanic and Asian-American congregations all consider social justice central to biblical faith Glenn Beck is telling all those Christians to leave their churches Of course Christians may disagree about what social justice means in our current political context -- and that conversation is an important one -- but the Bible is clear from the Mosaic law of Jubilee to the Hebrew prophets to Jesus Christ social justice is an integral part of God 's plan for humanity Beck says Christians should leave their social justice churches so I say Christians should leave Glenn Beck I don t know if Beck is just strange just trying to be controversial or just trying to make money But in any case what he has said attacks the very heart of our Christian faith and Christians should no longer watch his show His show should now be in the same category as Howard Stern Stern practices pornography and Beck denies the central teachings of Jesus and the Bible So Christians should stop watching the Glenn Beck show and pray for him and Howard Stern Beck also said that if his church was about 's ocial justice he would report his church to the church authorities What authorities Church bodies as diverse in their theology as the U S Conference of Catholic Bishops and the National Association of Evangelicals have explicitly endorsed social justice as a biblical imperative So here 's an idea how about reporting ourselves to Glenn Beck as church members and pastors who practice and preach social justice Since Sojourners mission is to articulate the biblical call to social justice I ll be the first to turn myself in And I invite you to join me in turning yourself in to Glenn Beck as a Christian who believes in social justice Let 's send him thousands of names 
Microsoft has said that it will require applications developers for its upcoming Windows Phone OS to sell their apps exclusively through the company 's official storefront reversing a long-held strategy of allowing a host of third-party retailers to sell Windows Mobile offerings It 's a move that 's sure to destroy some of the developer goodwill Microsoft has worked so hard to build up in recent weeks WinMo users have long been able to download apps from distributors such as GetJar PocketGear com and Handango in a ition to Microsoft 's Windows Marketplace for Mobile But the new policy will force developers to comply with Microsoft 's content and technical regulations to bring their Windows Phone wares to market ( Microsoft said business customers will be allowed to distribute apps outside Windows Phone Marketplace ) Astoundingly the news came just hours after Microsoft showcased its Silverlight technology and released developer tools for Windows Phone to make the OS more attractive and sway developers into its camp Microsoft is following the lead of Apple of course which has consistently angered developers by refusing to allow third-party distribution of iPhone apps and by employing inconsistent approval policies for its App Store Apple can continue to employ such a strategy thanks to the overwhelming popularity of the iPhone but Microsoft obviously doesn t have that luxury Supporting third-party retailers would surely hurt Microsoft 's overall revenue but the overwhelming majority of users will take the path of least resistance and shop at the source rather than seek out smaller vendors So the company would do well to immediately issue some clear-cut approval policies for its upcoming app store or better yet to rethink the strategy entirely 
Instead of joining us on the right side of history all the Republicans can come up with is 's low down stop everything let 's start over If you think you ve heard these same excuses before you re right When this country belatedly recognized the wrongs of slavery there were those who dug in their heels and said 's low down it 's too early things aren t bad enough Most responses to Reid have furiously concentrated on his spurious slavery analogy but I d like to call attention to his expression of what has become a staple of liberal thought that is even more disturbing the accusation that those who reject liberal nostrums are on the wrong side of history For some reason the Democratic caucus these days seems to be filled with deep thinkers who have cracked the code of the meaning and direction of history Just a couple of weeks ago the sage of Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown told the New York Times that I don t think in the end anybody here in our caucus wants to be on the wrong side of history This uncanny ability to get in step with history is of course not limited to Democrats who are elected For example a recent Nicholas Kristof column The Wrong Side of History charged that if moderate Democrats flinch and health care reform fails they ll be on the wrong side of history In fact it 's not limited to Democrats at all as evidenced by John McCain 's comment on Face the Nation last June that the United States needs to be on the right side of history in responding to the disputed Iranian elections and ensuing protests Thus history it must be noted does not have a narrow one-track mind Its commands clearly visible to those standing on its right i e left side are not limited to the enactment of ObamaCare they extend over the full range of the liberal agenda For example University of Chicago law professor Geoffrey Stone transmits the message from history 's lips to Huffington Post 's ears that all those who fail to accept the moral analogy between discrimination against blacks and discrimination against gays have simply blinded themselves to reason and you guessed it are on the wrong side of history ( I have recently discussed this 'm oral analogy and some questions it raises here ) 
At last week 's PDC the new name for our repository and modeling project was announced we are the SQL Server Modeling Services James Baker and Shoshanna Budzianowski did an awesome job of describing the Modeling Services database and how to get value from the domain models which are delivered in the latest CTP Check out the video of their session here This shows the value of a queriable database of UML and Assembly metadata in realistic developer scenarios The use of regular SQL Server Reporting Services reports and Excel to analyze and drill in to information is a direct result of making the metadata schemas ordinary relational structures using clear language from the domains I especially like the query that returns all uses of an interface across the System Runtime and Microsoft Uml2 domains including a UML diagram loaded into our database from IBM 's Rational Software Architect using an exported XMI file Also worth looking at is Kim Cameron and Gert Drapers presentation of the System Identity model wwhich is part of the Modeling Services CTP and will play an increasingly important role across other domains in the future You can see their presentation here Get the latest Modeling Services CTP from here 
We now know how Conan O Brien plans to leverage the huge swell of support he found online in the wake of being forced out at NBC a nationwide comedy tour The comedian announced on his Twitter account this morning the launch of TeamCoco com where fans can buy tickets to one of 30 shows kicking off in Eugene Oregon on April 12 The tour fittingly enough is called The Legally Prohibited From Being Funny on Television Tour a reference to the deal he made with NBC that keeps O Brien off the air until the fall A comedy tour has been rumored since shortly after Conan stepped down and we suspected something might be in the works when he finally joined Twitter (T witter ) ( and immediately found a huge fan base and changed one random girl 's life along the way ) Now Conan officially has an outlet to keep the momentum going while he determines his next move on TV 
Suvendu Roy of Titan Industries shares his inspirational encounter with a rickshaw driver in Mumbai Last Sunday my wife kid and I had to travel to Andheri from Bandra When I waved at a passing auto rickshaw little did I expect that this ride would be any different As we set off my eyes fell on a few magazines ( kept in an aircraft style pouch ) behind the driver 's back rest I looked in front and there was a small TV The driver had put on the Doordarshan channel My wife and I looked at each other with disbelief and amusement In front of me was a small first-aid box with cotton dettol and some medicines This was enough for me to realise that I was in a special vehicle Then I looked round again and discovered more - there was a radio fire extinguisher wall clock calendar and pictures and symbols of all faiths - from Islam and Christianity to Bu hism Hinduism and Sikhism There were also pictures of the heroes of 26 /11- Kamte Salaskar Karkare and Unnikrishnan I realised that not only my vehicle but also my driver was special I started chatting with him and the initial sense of ridicule and disbelief gradually diminished I gathered that he had been driving an auto rickshaw for the past 8-9 years he had lost his job when hisemployer 's plastic company was shut down He had two school-going children and he drove from 8 in the morning till 10 at night No break unless he was unwell Sahab ghar mein baith ke T V dekh kar kya faida Do paisa income karega toh future mein kaam aayega We realised that we had come across a man who represents Mumbai - the spirit of work the spirit of travel and the spirit of excelling in life I asked him whether he does anything else as I figured that he did not have too much spare time 
Microsoft is betting that Silverlight a web application framework and rival technology to Adobe 's Flash can help it woo mobile developers to its upcoming Windows Phone operating system So far at least the strategy appears to be working The gang from Redmond used its MIX10 event in Las Vegas this morning to release some free developer tools as well as to demonstrate some of the first third-party applications written for Windows Phone which seeks to embrace mobile entertainment in ways Windows Mobile simply couldn t Corporate VP Joe Belfiore showed off a slick mobile version of the 3D Xbox title The Harvest to demonstrate Silverlight 's capabilities as well as a news app from AP and a multimedia journal that leverage the technology Microsoft also trotted out some impressive third-party partners Developers who ve signed on to build atop Windows Phone include EA Mobile Foursquare Pandora and Sling Media Microsoft still faces a challenge in growing that list though thanks largely to the fact that Windows Phone will be incompatible with Windows Mobile and won t debut until late this year But if the company can continue to secure third-party developers and offer an impressive app catalog as the first devices come to market Microsoft may find itself back in the game with the Apples and Googles of the smartphone world 
History is full of examples of conquests that seemed easy and tempting but later turned out to be gigantic blunders One of them was Napoleon 's decision to invade Spain in 1808 and put his elder brother Joseph on the throne That was the first great miscalculation of his career I strongly suspect that Obama 's decision to reform American health care by thoroughly politicizing it will become his Spain a short-run victory that will in the long run prove disastrous for him Napoleon and Spain In 1808 Napoleon was the master of continental Europe To his south Spain was officially an ally but it was a nation long past its age of military power The Spanish army was no match for the French and Napoleon was certain he could easily crush it capture Madrid and send the corrupt King Charles IV packing Under the conventions of warfare at that time once you had beaten the enemy army and taken the capital city fighting ceased and the victor could enjoy the spoils of war Napoleon the great conqueror couldn t resist this piece of low-hanging fruit Things did not go according to Napoleon 's plans Defeating the Spanish army was easy enough as was the business of putting Joseph on the throne But afterward the country erupted in partisan warfare that gave us the word guerilla French garrisons and supply trains were attacked Spain was drenched in blood and the drain on French resources and manpower was debilitating For Napoleon conquering Spain was a self-inflicted wound that turned gangrenous 
The LA Times report on ethical concerns raised by Virginia Thomas wife of Supreme Court Judge Clarence Thomas who is an active tea partyer and conservative campaigner But it will make no difference to anything And here 's why In January report the Times Virginia who goes by Ginni started a non-profit lobbying group called Liberty Central that will organize activism around a set of conservative core principles She 's been on panels at CPAC and worked for the Heritage Foundation where Dick Cheney is sometimes a speaker On the surface it 's worrying it 's unfeasible to assume that the couple do not discuss politics and are not somewhat influenced by each others views But * Clarence Thomas is not his wife what if he 's a centrist and merely tolerates his wife 's leanings What if they re James Carville and Mary Matalin And if that 's not the case * People are less stupid than blogs ( like this one ) make out assuming he is right-wing and fully supports his wife 's views and keeps a laminated picture of Leo Strauss in his wallet Thomas is doubtless an intelligent man with a comprehensive grasp of the law It is somewhat ludicrous to argue that if he wanted to he could not utterly separate his views from his work He was born dirt poor experienced appalling racism and still occasionally votes against (p erceived ) black interests If he can make that separation why assume he can t make this one But if even that is too much of a stretch * Every judge holds political views there 's a myth that judges are apolitical Which is ridiculous However much Justice Scalia says he 's merely a constitutional literalist he 's clearly not a secret ACLU member in his spare time A child of eight could map each justice on a left / right spectrum with very little difficulty Is it a surprise that the Thomas household leans right Not if you look at his decisions So his wife 's activism will make little difference even if it makes all the difference it possible could 
If 2010 proves to be a wave election for the GOP conservatives can expect more than a few half-as-much Republicans to sweep into Congress What 's a half-as-much Republican One who 's willing to do half as much as liberals on big government initiatives Guys like John McCain and his sidekick Lindsey Graham for instance Or Maine 's Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe Or departing Senator George Voinovich But there 's an effective way to put half-as-much Republicans on notice defeat a couple of them in upcoming primaries especially in high-profile Senate contests Sending a couple of half-as-muchers to summertime defeats would create quite a stir and cause other such critters like Mark Kirk ( IL ) and Mike Castle (D E ) to pause Kirk and Castle are the likely GOP Senate nominees in their states It would also be a shot across the bow of the GOP Senate leadership which otherwise might generously want to accommodate its half-as-much brethren in the 112th Congress The aforementioned John McCain and Florida Governor Charlie Crist are both ripe for the picking Both face stiff primary challenges Senator McCain is squaring off against former U S Representative JD Hayworth Crist is already battling for his political life against former Florida House Speaker Marco Rubio No conservative worth his salt is unaware of the notorious independence of John McCain Arizona 's senior senator Having long ago wiggled from his conservative cocoon the senator prides himself on his eclectic policy choices He is gainst government-run health care but for cap and trade ( and then against it as the 2008 election progressed ) He 's a true blue warrior in the war on terror but squishy in the war to secure the nation 's southern border

After getting over the initial disappointment of finding ourselves in what I thought were going to be floor seats but ended up not being floor seats the show was amazing Even not having floor seats our seats were better than the last time I saw John a couple years ago In fact the whole show was even better than the last time ( even though this time did include a gross amount of PDA by a couple who probably would have been better off staying at home this time did not however include being hit by the man sitting behind us because we were standing and he thought we should be sitting long story You can read a bit about it here ) Michael Franti and Spearhead opened who I was thoroughly confused by ( they played a wide range of music styles and whenever someone in the band didn t have a part in the song they left the stage ) They did do a really good job of pumping us up which I suppose is the main task of the opener is They are entertainers for sure Also the lead singer ( Michael Franti ) popped up like three rows in front of where we were sitting to do one of his songs That was pretty sweet I love John Mayer I don t care what people say about him and I don t even really care what he says I ve said it before and I ll say it again - Continuum is one of my favourite albums ever He is a fantastic musician and a really gifted performer I ve been to two shows of his and I ve had an amazing time at both I was ready to hitchhike to Toronto to see him again on Sunday night I don t really know what to say there is just something about seeing one of your favourite artists live Magic Like last time I didn t take a picture of myself so you ll just have to believe that these pictures are mine and that I was actually there Lol xooxo Jer 
Less than 0 2 percent of people who use Twitter wind up going to news and media sites from the social-networking site according to a recent analysis by traffic-measurement firm Hitwise ( although Hitwise just looked at traffic coming from the web site not any third-party apps or services ) So what are the top places that users go from Twitter About 60 percent go to other social networks and entertainment sites says Hitwise primarily photo and video-sharing sites in other words places like Twitpic Tweetphoto YouTube Vimeo CollegeHumor and so on This isn t all that surprising since many of the most popular links that get passed around are photos and videos that have gone viral as marketing people love to say 
Before casting yea votes in favor of a government health care grab later this week wavering House Democrats may want to struggle out of the left 's ideological fog for a moment and consider the sad but instructive tales of the U S Postal Service and the city of Detroit Both are poster boys ( excuse me poster persons ) for how government can get almost anything gloriously wrong That the U S Postal Service is swimming in red ink isn t news The nation 's postal service despite its first-class mail monopoly swims in red ink a lot The important news to Americans as they follow Washington 's three-ring health care circus is that U S Postmaster General Joe E Potter wants to drop Saturday mail delivery as a cost-cutting measure To repeat the postmaster general wants to reduce service in an effort to staunch red ink That 's service as in mail delivery the U S Postal Service 's bread and butter Imagine a hamburger joint announcing to its customers that it plans to stop selling hamburgers a day or two a week to cut costs Of course a hamburger joint wouldn t limit the sale of hamburgers to keep its costs down The guy who owns the hamburger joint would get creative in his marketing and pricing to sell more hamburgers He might trim costs operationally but not at the expense of selling as many hamburgers as he and his help could flip Why the difference The hamburger joint can go out of business The U S Postal Service being immune to risk cannot Just like the nation 's postal service if enacted government-run health care will eventually have to limit access to services in an attempt however vain to contain costs No Propaganda Actually there 's precedent other than the postal service and one doesn t have to look all the way to Great Britain or even Canada to find it 
Every great American boom and bust makes and breaks its share of crooks The past decade -- call it the Ponzi Era -- has been no different except for the gargantuan scale of white-collar crime A vast wave of financial fraud swelled in the first years of the new century Then in 2008 with the subprime mortgage collapse it crashed on the shore as a full-scale global economic meltdown As that wave receded it left hundreds of Ponzi and pyramid schemes as well as other get-rich-quick rackets that helped fuel our recent economic frenzy flopping on the beach The high-water marks from that crime wave those places where the corruption reached its zenith are still visible today like the 17th floor of 885 Third Avenue in midtown Manhattan the nerve center of investment firm Bernard L Madoff Investment Securities -- and as it turned out a 65 billion Ponzi scheme the largest in history Or Stanfordville a sprawling compound on the Caribbean island of Antigua named for its wealthy owner a garrulous Texan named Allen Stanford who built it with funds from his own 8 billion Ponzi scheme Or the bizarrely fortified law office -- security cards surveillance cameras hi en microphones a private elevator -- of Florida attorney Scott Rothstein who duped friends and investors out of 1 2 billion The more typical marks of the Ponzi Era though aren t as easy to see Williamston Michigan for instance lacks towering skyscrapers Italian sports cars million-dollar mansions and massive security systems A quiet town 15 miles from Lansing the state capital Williamston is little more than a cross-hatching of a dozen or so streets A DOLLAR TIME store sits near Williamston 's main intersection -- locals affectionally call it the four corners -- and its main drag is lined with worn brick buildings passed on from one business to the next like fading hand-me-down jeans It 's here far from New York or Antigua that thanks to two brothers seized by a financial fever dream the Ponzi Era made its truest deepest American mark Jay and Eric Merkle active church members and successful local businessmen were well known among Williamston 's residents In 2004 the brothers discovered that an oil-and-gas venture which they had invested in and which promised them quick lucrative returns was a scam They d been duped Their next move should have been simple turn in the crooks and get on with their lives their pockets a few dollars lighter Jay and Eric however grasped the spirit of their age and made another decision entirely -- they teamed up with the guys who had ripped them off in the process switching from prey to predator That first venture actually floundered but in 2005 court records show they started their own Ponzi scheme Platinum Business Industries (P BI ) Based in Williamston PBI claimed it was socking its investors money into lucrative oil and gas exploration opportunities in Oklahoma and Texas and it promised the investors absurdly high returns -- 6 % a month or 72 % a year Despite such promises the brothers assured town locals handing over their hard-earned dollars that little risk was involved Even if the energy exploration didn t pay off the land acquired by PBI was valuable and could be sold to offset any losses Like Madoff in Palm Beach the Merkles in Williamston exploited local ties -- church and family -- to reel in new investors and like Madoff 's investment fund PBI too was a complete sham and a classic Ponzi scheme -- that is an investment scam in which existing investors returns are paid for with money from new investors In the case of PBI there was no energy exploration in Oklahoma and Texas Some of the money they received from later investors the Merkles used to pay off earlier ones and give their scheme the look of success But in their case there was a rub The Merkles were distinctly creatures of the Ponzi Era they evidently couldn t help themselves Even as they ran their own Ponzi racket documents show they were getting fleeced What they weren t paying out in fake returns the Merkles bet on high-yield get-rich-quick schemes in the U S and abroad that had nothing to do with oil and gas -- and other Ponzi schemers and con artists were robbing them blind Their financial crime spree collapsed in 2008 Dead-broke with investigators closing in they told investors that various foreign governments and banks had frozen their assets The brothers then asked them to wire more than a million dollars to Nigeria Ghana and other countries as fees to release their money even as they warned them against cooperating with an FBI investigation Then on a brisk autumn day in October 2008 the feds arrested to the two brothers the game was up In all via PBI and other scams they had duped more than 600 investors out of 50 million robbing some of their life savings When compared to Madoff 's or Stanford 's heists that sum was little more than pocket change But the Merkle brothers caught the true democratic spirit of a decade of an unrestrained magical thinking that infected rich and poor successful and ne er-do-well the financially sa y and neophytes who couldn t tell a stock from a bond Think of their story as a parable for the Ponzi Era they were taken decided to become takers took others then got taken again In the rush for the pot of gold at rainbow 's end they bet everything Main Street had to offer believing they could get away with it Thanks to an open credit spigot a booming housing market and visions of unimaginable wealth on Wall Street practically everyone in the United States in the past decade seemed to aspire to get rich -- and quick Perfectly ordinary people refinanced their homes refinanced again and used the money they got to stake themselves at the crooked casino table of American life Some rolled the dice in stocks bonds and second homes For millions more the gamble took the form of investment opportunities that promised wealth in a hurry opportunities now exposed as little more than financial con jobs People were shooting for that home run says Peter Henning a law professor at Wayne State University and white-collar crime expert They were saying I 'm just as smart as Warren Buffet Today with easy credit and the buy-now-pay-tomorrow culture that it spawned in the dustbin of history the Ponzis and pyramid schemes of the past decade can be seen for what they really were Not a week seems to go by without the Securities and Exchange Commission (S EC ) or the FBI or law enforcement officials busting another get-rich hustle Yet the full scope of the criminality of the Ponzi Era remains elusive no one yet knows just how widespread those Ponzi schemes were -- and how many may remain hi en or in plain sight Beyond the headliners like Madoff and Stanford Americans may not actually be aware of just how many schemes of this sort were abroad in our land -- but it probably doesn t matter much either Disillusionment with the past decade is such that many Americans now simply assume that our world is little but a giant Ponzi scheme Ponzis Ponzis Everywhere The wave of financial crime may have peaked in 2005 or 2006 but the detritus of such collapsed schemes has left regulators and investigators ever busier Almost four times as many Ponzi schemes broke down in 2009 -- 150 -- as in 2008 -- 40 According to the Associated Press the FBI began more than 2 100 securities fraud cases last year an increase from 1 750 the year before The SEC likewise dealt out 82 % more restraining orders against Ponzi schemes and similar frauds in 2009 than the previous year 
Many on the left are in denial The USS Obama certified as unsinkable a year ago is taking on water in its bilges It is starting to list portside in the dark cold political seas on its maiden voyage no less The Obama is made of sturdy stuff the left contends designed by the smartest engineers Its skeleton and hull shaped by unbendable liberal principles Its engines and turbines powered by attractive government-growing corporate-hating proposals Its furnaces stoked by legions of young and minority voters hopelessly idealistic and hungry for change and by the disaffected mi le class sick of the war on terror and disgusted by a widening income gap with the upper classes Its watertight compartments solid Democratic congressional majorities In seas thought to be smooth as glass Captain Barack Obama and his navigators Rahm Emanuel David Axelrod Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid plotted a swift course to a safe statist harbor Government-run health care cap and tax card check a pork-laden stimulus and re-imposition of the Fairness Doctrine among other government-aggrandizing measures would be achieved by voyage 's end But the first momentous voyage wouldn t be the ship 's last Not by a long shot No the Obama would venture out to sea again and again until the United States was transformed into a reasonable facsimile of a European welfare state a state like Britain or France or Germany with a dash of Venezuela for pizazz Equality of opportunity with its inevitable disparate results would give way to a society of broad redistributed wealth The satisfaction of achievement would come not from material reward but from the compulsory sharing of the reward 
At the tail end of our GDC interview with Lionhead 's Peter Molyneux we remembered one more question we simply had to know How well did Fable 2 's episodic experiment go We ll refresh your memory Last August Molyneux announced plans to release Fable 2 as a series of five downloadable episodes with the first one given away and the subsequent four priced at 10 each Molyneux 's response :\ That was hugely successful There were something like over half a million I think it was 600 000 downloads of the first episode which was very very cool Of course the first episode was free so how was the conversion rate It was a much higher than a normal conversion rate Molyneux smiled Massively massively successful and I really love this relationship which is much more sliced into episodes with consumers Of course knowing where we were going with this particular line of questioning Molyneux preemptively offered an answer But we re not announcing whether that 's coming out in this release he said tossing a smile towards the attentive PR people behind me 
The inspiration behind this body of work came from a growing curiosity about recent corporate developments of private space in London that apparently encourage the public to access them Typically these environments have beautiful landscaping around a canal or lake An amphitheatre seems to be a further prerequisite as is CCTV which monitors everything including security guards who amble around these empty places The hustle and bustle of neighboring streets feels a world away In the summer of 2008 I went for a series of walks along arterial routes heading out of London That summer I had read several of J G Ballard 's novels including Super Cannes which is about disturbing behaviour amongst the inhabitants of a gated community isolated from the world On one of these ambles I chanced upon a recently completed building development I felt compelled to enter this beautifully landscaped glass and steel environment It appeared as if no expense had been spared What I encountered there helped to crystallize some vague ideas that became the photographs that are presented in this collection The idyllic setting combined with the ever-present 's ecurity got under my skin and left me wondering about a dystopian outcome for this kind of world I remember sitting down by the artificial lake The sun was beating down and people casually wandered about I gazed up at the office blocks I thought it must be an idyllic place to work London felt far away I imagined that you could lift these acres up and deposit them in any city in the world and they would feel at home This was an anti-Dickensian space more an abstract one It was a statement of how the world of work could be The management ethos proclaimed on various signs was enjoy work Enjoy work Arbeit macht frei Freedom through work I rose to the bait Unease crept into my thoughts I found myself searching for the cracks A variety of methods had been used to try to block the sun reaching the interior spaces It appeared as if as each building had been erected ever more elaborate ways had been devised to keep nature out What was it really like to work in there I noticed that an algae bloom threatened the lake 's plant and animal life Peering into one building 's reception area I saw how the appearance of leisure had been carefully arranged Bicycles guitars and deckchairs in neat rows An abandoned chess game and open magazines on the coffee table A half-finished painting-by-numbers canvas on an easel No one about Why had everyone had to leave so su enly Or were they trying to hide something Soon after I was asked to leave for taking photographs without permission After some months I built an architectural model inspired by this corporate campus and began photographing I wanted a dystopian world centred on a dark lake that seemed to have the opposite effect on those that gazed into it than that intended by the landscape architect So some of the ant-like figures turn up to work use the facilities and leave Others seem to be employed in extracurricular activities of a more malevolent nature 
President Obama has repeatedly said that failure to pass a health care reform bill is simply not an option But Democratic leaders are facing an uphill battle in convincing some of their own members to push the legislation forward -- and hoping history doesn t repeat itself There 's a lot at stake for Obama 's future political observers say including the ability to get other key pieces of his legislative agenda passed and signed into law banking regulation climate change economic measures and immigration Republicans have marched nearly lockstep against Obama 's policy proposals especially on financial matters and indicate that they will continue to do so The bill 's failure could also spell trouble for Democrats facing tough election battles this year Whether or not the bill is passed Republicans have threatened to use it against Democratic opponents noting its cost and effect on the deficit As for the costs the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that the Democrats revised health care bill will cost 940 billion over the next 10 years a House Democratic source said Thursday The bill cuts the deficit by 130 billion during that period according to the source The president has stepped up his efforts to sway worried Americans He put his name on a health care reform proposal last month and then went on a campaign-like barnstorm across the country to warn Americans what will happen if reform isn t passed We need health insurance reform right now the president said at a rally outside Cleveland Ohio on Tuesday This debate is about far more than politics It comes down to what kind of country we want to be Obama said the status quo on health care is 's imply unsustainable a ing that Americans cannot have a system that works better for the insurance companies than it does for the American people Editorials in some of the nation 's top newspapers have also railed against keeping the status quo 
What it doesn t tell you the moments this movie is living in is the summer of 2001 and September 11 figures prominently in the final scenes The end is so controversial a number of blogs from New York Magazineto Gawker to even Perez Hilton gave every detail of it away This isn t a story for the faint of heart A junior-high-school-aged girl at my screening left the room weeping Adults had tears in their eyes The movie is poised to be one of the biggest tear-jerkers to come out of Hollywood since Titanic The question does Remember Me earn its tears or exploit September 11 for a cheap cry If you haven t read about the film online you ll probably go to the movie ( with a tween or two in tow ) expecting a sweet romance And that you ll get for most of the film There 's the prerequisite cheesy first-date dialogue at an Indian restaurant and the scene where de Ravin gets so drunk at a college frat party Pattinson holds her head back while she throws up None of this prepares you for what ultimately happens though a violent act in the first scene serves as eerie foreshadowing When the Twin Towers are hit we never see an airplane crash just the debris it 's a complete shock that will leave you sad and stunned for days But if you think about it wasn t that the way we all felt after September 11 The attack was completely unexpected just like the conclusion of this movie Other films about September 11 (W orld Trade Center United 93 ) have presented their grim subject matter from the very start in every TV ad and theatrical trailer Remember Me is targeted to a different demographic teenage girls many of whom were very young in 2001 For them September 11 is probably a distant memory or maybe even just a lesson in a history book especially for kids who didn t live in New York or Washington Given that measure this movie accurately depicts the horror danger grief rage meaninglessness and brutality of that day It actually honors history albeit in a strange and unsettling way 
I started explaining how atleast I was taking full advantage of my time to have adequate fun as compared to others who were just sitting and complaining I was all ready to propose my concept of relativity again But she had been listening to my rant like she usually does and then talked about one of her experiences She told about her conversation with a person with no legs and how difficult it must be But the guy replied atleast I don t suck like the ones who have no legs and feet Imagine how much it would suck to be them Suffice it to say my friend was aghast at that attitude She very simply asked me if maybe I was doing the same thing If maybe I was the guy with no legs who still thought atleast he was better than a person with no limbs at all I replied by saying that I was comparing myself with others not to feel better because of their misery but because I wanted to not be like them For me it was about motivation rather than wallowing in shared misery It was one of those moments when you yourself realize you have said something really smart She thought so too I guess because she actually wrote my rohanism down ) But this is what your smart friends do to you They extract these insightful thoughts out of you but still leave you with doubts But this is what I relish This is what I feel is the best part about having them around Life would be so much simpler if you were surrounded by people as dumb as as yourself But smarter ones make life interesting They challenge and disagree with your way of thinking without intending too That conversation left me in a similar place Even though I seemed to have convinced my friend I wasn t sure I had convinced myself But the great thing about that conversation is that ever since that day I have pretty much abandoned my silly concept of relativity Now every time I compare myself in a situation I take a moment to figure out the reasons for which I am doing it Ever since that day I have tried to follow that smart rohanism I uttered out of nowhere For the most part it has helped :) I like analogies I love drawing parallels in life Compare one stage with another Find something in common in two completely different walks of your own life or others To see how as we change we still remain the same Friends say its an annoying habit of drawing analogies between seemingly disparate sources To try and explain every occurrence I see by comparing it to something totally mundane and unrelated As if it 's a self trained mechanism to automatically explain things to myself that might seem out of the scope of my knowledge base One thing I have observed with a lot of friends as they have moved away from home for jobs or studies is the su en onset of loneliness 
I remember teaching user interface design courses back in the mid-nineties In those courses there was a slide entitled Rapid Prototyping and on that slide were all the reasons why rapid prototyping was a bad idea Most of the reasoning centered around prototyping tools being so complex back then they needed to be operated by developers subsequently the design process tended to be influenced by all design work needing to be interpreted through the lens of what a prototyper could actually achieve Fast forward to 2010 and there 's been a rethinking on prototyping A slew of new prototyping tools have appeared over the past few years and they re rapidly being adopted by interaction designers I guess the creators of these tools never attended one of my courses In fact two things changed to bring prototyping tools back into favor the tools themselves and the task they re being used to accomplish * Prototyping tools today are much more designer-friendly The adoption of user interface markup languages ( like HTML XAML and MXML ) our ability to build and run more sophisticated software today has made it easier to create design tools that work for designers rather than developers * At the same time the nature of what we re designing is changing As we move away from designs that are a series of relatively static pages or screens to designing applications that use fewer more dynamic pages it becomes harder to prototype these experiences using the traditional tools of paper prototyping and diagramming applications So we have perfect conditions for a new wave of prototyping tools rising demand and increasing capability Among this new breed of prototyping tools we find Microsoft Expression Blend SketchFlow ( for the purposes of this tutorial I ll be referring to it as simply SketchFlow ) While maintaining the Microsoft tradition of remarkably long product names SketchFlow takes a fairly unique approach to prototyping First I d like to point out that SketchFlow is part of Microsoft 's Expression Studio range of design tools After a lackluster history with design tools Microsoft seems to be finally getting their act together with Expression Studio (d isclaimer I ve previously worked at Microsoft ) Expression Studio is up to its third release and comprises four or five products depending on how you count them It 's important to note the relationship between SketchFlow and Expression Blend Expression Blend is the production tool for Silverlight Windows (W indows Presentation Foundation ) and Surface whereas SketchFlow is a prototyping tool built on top of Expression Blend 
For the filmmakers at French production company H5 starting with a clean storyline was key As everything is a logo the story had to be as simple as a logo explains Hervé de Crécy one of the film 's directors Efficient Simple Hollywood After the plot was set every trip to the supermarket was also a casting call for the 2 500 brands that de Crécy estimates finally landed a role For more inspiration they browsed among the virtual aisles at brandsoftheworld com Because Los Angeles is a city of signs built on a structured grid Hollywood became setting as well as inspiration which also explains why this French film has English dialogue The filmmakers generally used established U S brands figuring they have a more universal appeal but also included logos from other countries like Japan 's beef bowl restaurant Yoshinoya Germany 's Afri cola trees and Kuwaiti oil company Q8 's sailboats The team originally proposed the world of logos for a music video but the concept was vetoed So they worked on the film in secret between other video and commercial projects for the next several years Working without permissions they didn t want companies making ads in adjacent studios to catch a glimpse so they blocked off their small room with a folding fabric screen In most cases says de Crécy they used the logos without authorization but some companies in the loop actually asked to have their logos be included such as IBM which provided some equipment for the project What the computer giant didn t get was input on what happened to the logo which ultimately collapses into itself during the earthquake The Los Angeles Zoo told the filmmakers that they probably would have said no if asked for permission to use their logo in the onscreen zoo but in the finished product they actually liked the heroic way their zookeeper (p layed by the Green Giant ) protects the animals during the disaster De Crécy who has a background in graphic design acknowledges that Logorama is part criticism and part celebration Of course it 's a tribute to these logotypes and to the designers of all these logotypes There are many that are absolutely beautiful he says But he did enjoy tweaking the familiar symbols As the director says assigning new personalities was a kind of game for us Near the close of the film the National Geographic yellow border makes its cameo tucked into a pouch in the door of the getaway car Big Boy and the Esso girl use to flee the chaos With the travel literature alongside it ( Lonely Planet and a Michelin guide ) the vehicle is clearly going to be a get-far-away car Director de Crécy says our logo was too abstract to turn into a character but given its square shape it was a perfect fit to depict what else a magazine Talk about logotypecasting But this makes a lot of sense since the logo is derived from the crisp window of yellow trim that frames the magazine The border first appeared in February 1910 it was adorned with oak leaves and acorns Over the century the leaves were slowly dropped from the design the last ones fell in September 2000 leaving this vivid rectangle So happy 100th yellow border And congrats on the new film career Hope your agent gets you a starring role next time 
We may not know much more about lasers than Austin Powers 's nemesis Dr Evil but we can tell you that Logitech has put the technology to outstanding use in its MX1000 Laser Cordless Mouse It 's not as huge a shift as it was going from rollerballs to optical sensors but the MX1000 does usher in a new age in computer mice Logitech claims that its new MX Laser Engine is 20 times more sensitive than a standard LED While it may be able to read a finer image the MX1000 still uses a relatively common 800-dots-per-inch (dp i ) optical sensor--the same as in Logitech 's MX510 Performance Mouse But because the laser tracks movement more accurately than a standard LED the MX1000 takes a more precise read of the surface resulting in more exact cursor movement onscreen The cursor never jumped or paused in the three months we used it and in a ition to the 80 MX1000 's laser precision it is comfortable to use--for right-handers anyway The deeply carved left side provides a snug perch for your thumb and the rubberized plastic on either side makes for exceedingly comfortable mousing You ll find three programmable keys above your thumb and three more including the scrollwheel itself are on the top The wireless mouse ships with an RF base station which doubles as a battery charger Battery life is phenomenal you can go days without recharging We particularly like the battery-power meter along the top of the mouse You may forget to recharge the MX1000 at the end of the day because the battery lasts so long on a single charge so the three green LEDs are a good reminder when it gets down to one light it 's time to recharge 
Jody Gerut plays outfield for the Milwaukee Brewers After a good return to the majors in 2008 in which he posted a 351 OBP Gerut fell to 279 in 2009 At age 32 he can t afford to play another season like that Teams won t continue to pay 2 million for that kind of performance The interesting thing about 2009 was that Jody upped his line drive percentage That usually leads to a higher BA not a lower one If he maintains that rate there 's a good chance his luck changes and he winds up with a better 2010 New research shows that Hank Greenberg 's walk rate went way up at the end of 1938 season as he approached Babe Ruth 's single season home run record Howard Megdal suggests that Greenberg 's religion caused the league to pitch around him but Greenberg didn t buy it at the time Opposing teams tend to walk big home run hitters and Greenberg showed a big leap in home runs in 1938 from a career high 40 the year before Greenberg was also 27 that season at the peak of his athletic performance I think randomness is as good an explanation as antisemitism As Megdal says in the article It is impossible to know what was in pitchers hearts 
The first few days of the Big East Tournament haven t disappointed with a host of thrilling games already in the books Georgetown today dethroned the mighty Syracuse Orangemen at Madison Square Garden 91-84 thanks to a epic 27-point performance from junior forward Chris Wright The 3 ranked Orangemen were also dealt a potentially crucial blow going into March Madness with Arinze Onuaku suffering an injury to his knee Last night Cincinatti kept their NCAA Tournament dreams alive by upsetting Rick Pitino 's Louisville Cardinals 69-66 Marquette won two tight games against St John 's and Villanova to advance to semi-finals with the Hoyas Even the early game was exciting with Seton Hall outlasting Providence in a game where over 200 points were scored Whoever emerges victorious out of this year 's Big East Tournament will be riding a emotional high going into the Big Dance The world 's oldest tennis tournament will be played June 21st - July 4th at the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club just outside London The 124th Wimbledon promises to be one of the most highly anticipated sporting events on the planet this summer The game of tennis is fortunate to have a bevy of international stars playing in the game currently The world 's will be at their best on the grass courts of the All England as Wimbledon is often considered the grandest of all the grand slam titles Participants dress in white as is tradition while spectators eat strawberries and cream or drinking Primm Spritzers 
I placed two electronics orders this week one with Crutchfield and one with Amazon The Crutchfield order was fraught with difficulty They asked for some info that Amazon never asked for and the credit card company gave them trouble It looked like the order a TV and soundbar-with-woofer would be delayed I said so on Twitter Even though the TV was a very interesting and totally new product from Sony and very reasonably priced Further Amazon was only taking pre-orders Crutchfield had it in stock At the same time the order I placed on Amazon went through with out a hitch I praised them on Twitter and said Crutchfield should try to be more like Amazon Heh The Crutchfield order which was far more complex ( a 46-inch TV ) but not much more expensive than the Amazon one is complete And unusually the Amazon order is lost in UPS hell It 's been out for delivery for almost 48 hours After I paid for 1-day turnaround the best they can offer is they ll refund the 3 99 I paid ( how generous of them he said sarcastically ) and say I should wait until the 22nd Geez if I wanted it that slow I wouldn t have bought it from Amazon Sometimes I wonder if they look at their records to see how much I spend with them It 's guys like me that keep them flying First Class instead of coach Couldn t they arrange a Saturday delivery Couldn t they call UPS and find out what they did with my delivery BTW I ordered the Fujitsu scanner I wrote up here It was a total impulse buy A product I 'm paying to review Nothing more aggravating than an impulse buy that turns into a support issue 
Lists are the cotton candy of journalism--hard to resist but not very nourishing Travel Leisure Magazine has come out with such a list it purports to tell us the world 's 15 ugliest buildings Chicago 's Harold Washington Library Center designed by Chicago architect Tom Beeby is on it along with Frank Gehry 's Experience Music Project in Seattle and Michael Graves Portland Building I ve never been a big fan of the Harold Washington Library Center--its classical facade is leaden its rooftop ornament is cartoonish and its lobby has all the grace of a shopping mall But one of the world 's ugliest buildings Nah The really ugly buildings as the story accompanying the list says are the anonymous ones where architects aren t even trying to make a statement And for what it 's worth the Harold Washington Library Center made the list of America 's Favorite Architecture when the American Institute of Architects published the results of a national poll in 2007 
Every March users all around the world flock to Yahoo Fantasy Sports to play our NCAA Tournament bracket game Tourney Pick Em It 's one of our most popular games In many ways it 's also one of our simplest Just fill out your bracket by selecting the teams you expect will win Sounds easy right Well there 's a catch there are 9 223 372 036 854 780 000 different possible ways you can fill your bracket out That absurdly huge number presents a challenge for us as well How do you make something with 9 quintillion possible combinations so easy-to-use that a user can fill out their brackets in just a couple of minutes The answer involves a fair amount of JavaScript beneath the hood which we call our bracket engine The bracket engine we had been using since 2004 had served us well but after six NCAA tournaments it was beginning to show it 's age The YUI Library didn t even exist when it was first written ( for that matter neither did JSON or Firebug ) So for this year 's game we decided that instead of the incremental improvements we normally make we d start from scratch Rebuilding from the ground up gave us the opportunity to completely modernize our bracket engine so it 's only fitting that we went as modern as we could by using YUI 3 This would be one of the first projects Yahoo Fantasy Sports has built with YUI 3 but at this point we knew that the strengths of the library were too great to pass up Happily the new bracket engine turned out even better than we had hoped for 
These white papers attempt to capture and frame the issues and approaches particular to social interaction design (Sx D for short ) Each a resses a particular aspect of the design of social software As they were written over the past three years they progress from theoretical considerations which drove the first papers to the more design-oriented topics covered in recent papers In the early papers I examine social software sites and online communities whose participation and user experience reflected the closed system character of sites like Friendster com MySpace com and Tribe net In particular I was interested in the degree to which those sites produced rich relationships and mediated social interactions including group and cultural dynamics The later white papers take up social interaction on open systems and include discussions of Web 2 0 elements navigation and content organization In these interactions and user contributions are bound less by community membership and more by emerging social practices Clearly early adopters of sites like Friendster ( one could go back to CMC systems usenet IRC chats and so forth of the 90s ) helped to establish practices that have now been widely adopted by social media in general I ve tried to identify the engines of user participation at work in a variety of thematically-oriented social media systems including the communication transaction social and economic models behind each I describe all of these systems as talk systems and model the user and social interactions manifest in each on conversation and speech rather than publishing and writing It seems clear that the Web 's ability to make users visible through their own contributions involves a production of presence that leads inevitably to psychological interpersonal communicative and social phenomena that we observe and assign to these systems but which emerge at the second not first order of user interaction Thus the problem of designing social software is a problem of applying leverage and guidance through the site 's information architecture navigation schema use of communication tools presentation of user contributions and structuring of time ( from permanent to fast-fading content ) Social interaction design perhaps most resembles that of the urban architect design planning modeling and execution still cannot ( thankfully ) regulate actual use But walkways open spaces landscaping use of light and surface perspective and material do of course create context and environment The user falls into a relationship with a site 's other users or audience that sets his or her needs and expectations as much as the software design itself Hence the importance of moving from a user-centric methodology to one that applies our understanding of communication and interaction as social practices On social media systems all action is socially informed And yet the social cannot be engineered Hence the importance of understanding and anticipating the social dimensions of activity on these sites I hope you enjoy these and as always I welcome feedback Upcoming papers will cover recent trends in Web 2 0 sites and services and directions for the development of future systems I hope to also post in-depth UI critiques of popular web 2 0 and social media sites Read more http // www gravity7 com / articles_whitepapers html ixzz0idxwXO3H 
Watch this and die from hysterical bouts of laughter Only for those who know Russian But anyway - visuals are also good By the way long time ago I was a Viseum Ad Agency started this new campaign for Hummer Get Out of My Way Exactly I 'm not sure who exactly buys Hummers in Europe or the US ( Borat ) but in Moscow ( judging by their driving habit ) they are all blood-thirsty Trolls from Mordor It 's hard to say as windows are always heavily tinted This ad was criticized by Russian advertising community for being actually a call for irresponsible behavior teacher of English and German at a high school numero uno in Onega Arkhangelsk Region ( activate your Google Earth ) This is one of the most hilarious cartoons I ve ever seen in my life Every bottle of this Standart vodka has a small silver coin Coins are different so one has a chance to become an owner of a good collection Recommended retail price is 160 rubles ( 6 15 ) I see a man ( left ) and a squatted woman with a huge hair do ( right ) who 's giving the man a blow job Prodvizheniye company from St Petersburg promotes a vodka brand RUS that should be national and local at the same time It 's label looks like a car license plate with regional codes If you live in Chita you buy 75 vodka but if you re from Saratov then you choose 64 Your local chauvinism should prevent you from buying alien vodkas I 'm sure St Petersburgers (78 code ) would angrily refuse even to touch 97 vodka ( Moscow ) But wait Moscow has at least three codes 97 99 117 Muscovites are already too rich and now they get at least four different vodkas while the rest of the country must be satisfied with only one It 's unclear to me why all prizes for the most stupid ridiculous and unfocused commercials in Russia are always won by ramen noodles producers Take this piece of commercial by Rollton for example If you want to win your man give him Rollton ramen noodles Right This is a kind of birthday dinner every homeless dreams about 
Talk about a welcome change in narrative Think back to 2009 and pretty much all the story-lines in women 's tennis were decidedly negative poor quality matches Dinara Safina at number one without a Slam and then breaking down under all the pressure It was an annus horriblis for women 's tennis summed up by a lack of standout moments bar Kim Clijsters fairytale US Open success But even that had a flipside raising the question of how she could win a Slam in just her third event back on tour There are more exciting matches and more positive story-lines Justine Henin is back and has already reached two finals this season in Brisbane and at the Australian Open Her Belgian compatriot Clijsters is also playing a full calendar this year and already has a WTA title to her name so far in 2010 Serena Williams has defended her Australian Open crown and remains right where she belongs at world number one And there is evidence that those who wrote off Venus Williams may have to revise their opinions The seven-time Grand Slam singles champion is on a 10 match winning streak having won WTA titles in Dubai and Acapulco in February 
England manager Martin Johnson went on to the pitch at the final whistle to question Lawrence about his control of the scrums I was just asking him for clarification that 's all Johnson said At scrum time he was very quick to penalise which is fine if we were wrong But I said that he had to penalise them first time as well One scrum was reset and then they kicked three points just before half-time and I asked him why he didn t penalise them as well It doesn t matter what I think about his performance He refs the game so his decision is final and that 's fine But Lewis Moody who captained England for the first time in the absence of the injured Steve Borthwick refused to blame Lawrence There 's no point blaming the referee it 's our game to win not his We have just got to be more clinical Moody said Ireland 's defeat in their last game at Croke Park before they return to the redeveloped Lansdowne Road ended their slim title hopes and cost them their fifth Triple Crown in seven seasons A last-minute penalty from fly-half Dan Parks saved Scotland from the wooden spoon and clinched their first win in Dublin since 1998 Italy beaten 33-10 by Wales at the Millennium Stadium propped up the table for the third successive season We came here to spoil the party and we sort of did that We are delighte d Parks said Scotland 's win was their first in the Six Nations under former England head coach Andy Robinson after near misses against Wales and Italy Wales had to settle for fourth place two years after they completed the Grand Slam 
The pending arrival of the 4G wireless technologies particularly LTE-A but in general even the 4G-Lite versions of LTE and WiMax foreshadows a fundamental change for the mobile phone industry I 'm not just talking about the move to flatter IP-based architectures or mobile connections approaching ( or exceeding ) 100Mbps or the popularity of 3DTV I 'm talking about the demise of the mobile plan based on voice minutes It is already becoming standard practice for the Operators to mandate data plans with the purchase of the latest smartphones In the next two years we are looking at a 50 % growth in phones with Advanced OS ( Android iPhone Blackberry OS Symbian S60 ) which will continue to drive the push for mandatory data plans These are data plans with values that can easily exceed the value of the voice plan for the same device And they should for a growing segment of the population voice usage is dropping dramatically while data usage is skyrocketing ( tell me something I don t know right ) So at what point do the voice minute plans become irrelevant for these data-oriented devices and voice-only plans become the entry-level point for the operators for base devices Operators could continue to offer voice minutes as part of their plan but to what effect When voice truly moves to IP whether it is VoIP via Skype or some other program just how does the operator actually MEASURE and thus value voice traffic A circuit that can be measured in time is no longer set up packets are sent only when there is something to be transmitted so time as a measure of a voice call becomes irrelevant So how do you measure the value of the mobile connection You COULD still use minutes to measure plan value but with certain demographics using less and less voice and more and more data it would seem this is so well sooo 2010 and not 2012 Or soo 2G and not 4G I ll be watching to see how these plans develop 
Upon arriving at the Courtyard Marriott hotel on my recent trip to Toronto I bypassed the regular line and wandered right up to the Elite Guest Check-in desk Checking in for Wesson I said handing my credit card to the front-desk clerk The front-desk clerk punched my name into the computer and said Yes Mr Wesson Welcome back You are staying with us for four nights I no ed The front-desk clerk continued Excellent We have your Platinum number on file As your arrival gift would you like the bonus points or would you prefer to get something from our Market the clerk asked motioning towards the small shop for snacks and drinks I ll take the points I said I smiled to myself and thought That 's another two-hundred and fifty more points towards my goal At Home In Airworld I live somewhere else in the margins of my itineraries I call it Airworld the scene the place the style My hometown papers are USA Today and the Wall Street Journal The big-screen Panasonics in the club rooms broadcast all the news I need with an emphasis on the markets and the weather Airworld is a nation within a nation with its own language architecture mood and even its own currency - the token economy of airline bonus miles that I ve come to value more than dollars - Up In The Air ( book ) Walter Kirn I went this past weekend to see the new movie Up In the Air based upon a book which I had previously read by Walter Kirn In the movie George Clooney plays Ryan Bingham a corporate down-sizing consultant who spends much of his life travelling for work Though Bingham has an apartment in Omaha he feels more at home in Airworld literally up in the air on the airplanes and on the ground in the airports hotel suites and rental cars that make up his travelling life Bingham has a goal one he is slightly embarrassed to admit at times It is to join the elite group of American Airlines customers who have amassed 10 million air miles 
The Carolina Chocolate Drops are a trio that brings back the tradition of old-timey string band music and takes it into the 21st century The group has three members Rhiannon Gi ens Dom Flemons and Justin Robinson who sing and play banjo fi le and percussion and met in North Carolina in the early 2000 's The group uses old time folk tunes and reels as jumping off points to their own musical conception Hit em Up Style 's hows this well by taking what could be a modern sounding soul and R B tune about revenge for infidelity and putting Rhiannon 's strong and sassy vocals in front of a swirling raw toned fi le The effect works well as does the more traditional sounding work like You re Baby Ain t Sweet Like Mine with some deft kazoo work emphasizing the double entendre nature of the lyrics and Cornbread and Butterbeans Snoeden 's Jig is a nice centerpiece for the instrumental work of the band while Reynadine is a beautifully haunting a capella performance This album is a little on the short side clocking in at about an LP 's length but it feels right There 's nothing contrived about the music here whether it is a remake of a traditional song or an original composition the group plays with strength and conviction throughout Moreland and Arbuckle - Flood Moreland and Arbuckle are Aaron Moreland on guitar and Dustin Arbuckle on harmonica and vocals They play a high energy roots rock / blues that is akin in some ways to The Black Keys The music hews closely to the blues but plays them in different styles uptempo blues rock with the help of drummer Brad Homer really pulsing and pushing the music along like on the opener Hate to See You Go They play a blistering electric version of The Legend of John Henry which weds the folkloric narrative of the to a blasting roadhouse beat The band mixes in some nice soulful numbers and acoustic blues for a well rounded sound Fans of roots Americana music and gutbucket blues will find a lot to enjoy First class straight ahead mainstream jazz from Mike LeDonne on Hammons B3 Organ Eric Alexander on tenor saxophone Peter Bernstein on guitar and Joe Farnsworth on drums Just like they say on the tin the first four performances are uptempo groovers with strong rich organ and deep swirling tenor saxophone Deep Blue 's lows down to slow ballad tempo with washes of organ and patient probing saxophone Sunday in New York is a medium tempo groove with a nice patient guitar solo and rolling organ feature Bopsolete is fast paced bebop with Alexander taking a rapid and accelerated solo LeDonne keeps the organ bubbling fast then makes way for a hot drum solo The standard On the Street Where You Live has a nice flowing guitar solo and a soulful saxophone interlude Listeners with tastes for organ and tenor work along the lines of of the template Jimmy Smith and Stanley Turrentine laid down in the 50 's and 60 's will be happy with the music here it is consistently played at a high level 
My comments about movie theaters aside I 'm going to see this I don t like the trailer But I do like Queen Latifah And I love the Negroes at Court Street in Bk (\ Bitch got thrown Bitch got thrown ) I actually troll the bad black rom-com DVDs in search of half-decent material Every once in a while you come with a goodie Breaking All The Rules is really underrated And the world will not be truly postracial until you see a flick like The Seat Filler is in theaters and The Ugly Truth is straight to DVD There 's a good convo going on below about my post earlier this week on Ben Roethlisberger I think the take-away for me is that this a post that should have stayed in my head and off the page We all have our musings and the kind of conversation we might have over beers with friends But That 's very different than posting something on the Atlantic 's website For me the salient facts are as follows I have no idea what happened and in such an instance it 's almost never a good idea to start publicly riffing Rape is a serious accusation and a kind of crime that presents a specific problem to those who like to bat these kind of things around I 'm not convinced that my contribution to the conversation--absent of any real facts--actually helps anyone or clarifies anything Look I 'm a football fan with a particular curiosity about the justice system This case obviously appeals to my interests But on reflection I don t think I had anything of substance to a There are limits to living in your own head Likewise there are limits your ability to discern between your occasional thoughts and writing with substance I failed on that count here While we re in full apology mode I ve been informed by a couple people that Streisand is actually an old-school homophobic slur This highlights the importance of only riffing off jokes that you actually understand My apologies to all I would change the post 's title But that feels deceptive Anyway I 'm leaving comments off I think that 's enough meta analysis and navel-gazing for one day Let 's not make worse I think I have some sense of why this whole conversation might be frustrating Rape has a psychological element that thrives on shame In our justice system the burden is always on the accuser but that burden falls especially hard when there are significant disincentives to reporting the crime and testifying about it Sexual assault is humiliating and no one really wants to relive that humiliation Moreover I think getting accused of sexual assault twice raises some basic human suspicions But that said I 'm not exactly sure what to do here I think we all find the presumption of innocence to be essential With that in mind--What specifically should we be saying How should we be talking about the anonymous accuser What specifically constitutes taking alleged sexual misconduct seriously Should we really be in the business of denouncing alleged crimes Was the rush to condemn in the Duke Rape Case excusable 
Yes that 's an unabashed cop from the Barney Stinson playbook but given the film in question we re pretty sure he d approve especially since among the plot keywords listed for Bitch Slap on IMDb are such gems as breasts 's ex 's tripper beautiful woman female nudity and wait for it lesbian scene Mind you you also get non-linear timeline nun Tourette 's Syndrome and yo-yo but let 's not lose our focus here Here 's the two-sentence summary of Bitch Slap that 's been floating around the internet When three curvaceous babes arrive at a desert hideaway to steal over 200 million from an underworld kingpin things quickly spiral out of control Allegiances are switched truths are revealed criminals are unmasked and nothing is quite what it seems as the fate of the world is precariously balanced among this trio of sexy femmes fatales Bitch Slap is definitely an acquired taste with its attempt to offer up a tongue-in-cheek version of the kind of motion pictures that are virtual parodies to begin with but if you approach it with the right mindset it 's a laugh riot It also looks gorgeous and that 's even when the aforementioned trio of curvaceous babes aren t on the screen but when they are Look out Bullz-Eye had a chance to chat with one of those lovely ladies Erin Cummings who plays Hel in conjunction with the release of Bitch Slap on DVD and when we did you can bet we made sure to ask her about as many of those plot keywords as possible 
Inside the BPA Group at Forrester we conducted a little experiment I suggested that we should collaborate on a piece about the Pega acquisition of Chordiant What followed was a large number of email exchanges I drew the short straw in bringing all these thoughts together into a coherent whole I prepared a document for Forrester clients to explore the acquisition in detail (p robably getting through the editing process next week some time ) and this blog post is culled from that document So while the blog post bears my name it reflects the collective opinions of Connie Moore Bill Band Natalie Petouhoff John Rymer Clay Richardson Craig Le Claire and James Kobielus Of course I have put my own interpretation on it too Pega definitely wants to be in the customer experience / customer service business and they want to get there by having a very strong BPM offering It is not that they are moving away from BPM in favor of Customer Experience they re just strengthening their hand in CRM ( or CPM as they would call it ) more forcefully making the connection We already knew this but the Chordiant deal just reinforced that point (s ee related research doc from Bill Band in 2005 ) This is not a new direction or change in direction for Pega it is a strong move that takes them faster in the direction they were already going From a product point of view Pega are a ing / strengthening their hand Choridant 's marketing automation and predictive analytics seem to be of greatest interest Of course Pega also values the engineering talent that Chordiant has and will redirect those people over time to work on integrating these capabilities into the BPM offering They were also interested in the vertical industry and functional expertise that Chordiant had to offer 
The British Airways strike has dragged up from our collective memory recollections of dismal days of endless walkouts go-slows blackings picket lines and tea and sandwiches at No 10 Back in the 1960s and 1970s the unions were throttling our factories public transport schools hospitals power stations and even our cemeteries These days along with British Airways we ve got the threat of rail strikes over Easter and the prospect of 200 000 civil servants walking out on Wednesday to celebrate Mr Darling 's Budget I thought we d swept away all that nonsense with Margaret Thatcher 's trades union reforms These were drawn up to protect workers from being intimidated into strikes and to prevent unfair industrial action by threatening the unions with fines When drafting them I drew on my own experience as a trades union activist and on the knowledge that while much of the industrial disruption which had brought down both the Heath and Callaghan governments was politically motivated not every strike is an act of mindless aggression Not all strikers are greedy lazy strike-happy shop-floor workers nor were all strikes plotted by the cloth-capped colonels of the TUC in pursuit of a coup d état There are moments when reasonable workers clash with short-sighted arrogant incompetent or frightened managements and in despair they simply walk off the job It is important that ministers understand that fact I certainly did because in my time I had been both a striker and a blackleg There is an element of obduracy to the BA strike and it runs the risk of becoming a suicide pact between the airline and its cabin staff If this were to be the case then I am sure that the unemployment and losses invoked would be regarded by the apparatchiks of Unite as a price well worth paying in its bid to rule the political and industrial roost However the real danger from the resurgence of industrial mayhem will not become clear until after the general election Whether Cameron outloses Brown or Brown outloses Cameron ( for neither is likely to postively win the support of the electorate although I suppose the wife of one or the other could ) whichever of the two men finds himself in No 10 will have no choice but to tackle the massive public debts incurred over the past 13 years of Government waste 
It has become a Wine Talk column tradition that following every Monterey Wine Competition since its inception in 1994 I devote part of an ensuing column to selected value gold medal wines The 17th annual Monterey Wine Competition was staged March 6-7 at the Salinas Valley Fairgrounds in King City CA Here are the highlights from this week 's nationally syndicated Creators Syndicate Wine Talk column EOS Estate Winery 2007 French Connection Paso Robles ( 18 ) This red Bordeaux-style blend from the up-and-coming Paso Robles region is a steal in this price range It was nominated for the sweepstakes round of voting for Best of Show and thus was elevated from gold to platinum Ventana Vineyards 2007 Rubystone Arroyo Seco ( 18 ) Another gold that was elevated to Platinum as a result of being nominated for Best of Show consideration This red Rhone-style blend is heavy on the Grenache which lends a pure red-fruit aroma profile The scent of white pepper is unmistakable and very sexy The previous vintage of Rubystone also earned gold and made it to the sweepstakes of the 2009 Monterey Wine Competition Castello Banfi 2008 Centine Bianco Toscana ( 12 ) This blend of Pinot Grigio Sauvignon Blanc and Chardonnay is a sensational everyday white delivering refreshing and complex flavors at a low low cost Lava Cap 2007 Barbera Reserve El Dorado ( 18 ) The wines of California 's Sierra Foothills aren t the easiest to find but they are certainly worthy of the effort to seek them out This one 's great for grilled meats with savory seasonings or with flavorful pasta dishes Little Black Dress 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon California ( 11 ) It 's a feat to be able to tantalize the taste buds with a mass-produced commercial Cabernet but Little Black Dress pulls it off consistently If you re on a tight budget this is a great Cab for the money PS At the same price the Little Black Dress 2008 Chardonnay also earned Platinum Villa San-Juliette 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon Paso Robles ( 15 ) Dollar for dollar perhaps the best value in red wine I encountered at this year 's Monterey competition The winemaker Adam LaZarre is a rising star and his wines at Hahn Estates his previous stop were stellar over the better part of his decade there This one was elevated to Platinum by virtue of its presence in the sweepstakes round Fleur de California 2007 Pinot Noir Carneros ( 17 ) You simply don t find many gold medal Pinots for less than 20 a bottle Or even 30 a bottle So this wine stands out on the merits and the price Get it while it lasts Fish Eye 2007 Pinot Noir South Eastern Australia ( 7 ) See the above Jefferson Vineyards 2008 Petit Verdot Virginia ( 19 ) I realize this wine from southern Virginia will be nearly impossible to source unless you are visiting the Charlottesville area for some reason but I mention it because the panel that judged it loved it and one even pegged it for a Virginia wine 
Its inaugural programme will see productions exploding like party-poppers around the country over the coming year The range of work promises to be consistently attention-worthy whether it be a new play about the Bridgend suicides a forgotten early drama by John Osborne or a major revival of The Persians by Aeschylus As for locations few travellers guides could offer such an adventurous variety audiences will be invited into miners institutes in the Valleys on to the beaches of North Wales into a replica village on a MOD firing range in the Brecon Beacons somewhere in Snowdonia all across Port Talbot Stick a pin in a map and something theatrical is almost certain to be in the offing there In fact the only obvious locale that hasn t been commandeered as a site-specific venue is a disused colliery Don t worry John McGrath NTW 's energetic and articulate artistic director assures me as we pace the rain-so en high street of Blackwood a small town in the South Wales Valleys where the first production is about to be unveiled We re already having discussions about that Would we try and take people down a mine Absolutely But we d do it in an unusual way Born in Wales but raised in Liverpool and hence regarded as an outsider much in the mould of the NTS 's English director Vicky Featherstone McGrath shows such obvious devotion to the cause of giving NTW a big-splash start that it feels churlish to ask does Wales need its own national theatre In fact you could ask does it need a second national theatre Because unnoticed by many a dedicated Welsh-language company Theatr Genedlaethol Cymru was launched in 2003 A former Eng Lit student at Oxford where he first started to direct before honing his craft in Poland then New York and latterly Manchester which saw him build an experimental buzz around the Contact Theatre McGrath 47 reflects If you re going to have national theatres theatres that enable countries to think about themselves then Wales needs one You could just put more money into touring but that wouldn t have the same effect The word national focuses everyone 's minds With Wales there 's an a ed complexity surrounding language There was a feeling that Welsh-language theatre needed a scale it hadn t had the opportunity to work on before After that the question was what about English language theatre given that English is a language virtually everyone in Wales shares 
A DIRECTOR is preparing for a homecoming as his comedy arrives in Manchester today David L Williams 's British comedy Beyond the Pole kicks off its first north west airing at the Cornerhouse cinema The film was both directed and co-produced by David under the company he runs with real-life partner Cold Feet and Friends star Helen Baxendale who also stars in the movie David 39 said I 'm really chuffed this film is being showed in Manchester it is like a homecoming Though raised in Sale David now lives in London with Helen and their three children but still has friends living in Urmston The couple founded Shooting Pictures in 2000 Their latest offering tells the story of two pals played by Green Wing 's Stephen Mangan and comic actor Rhys Thomas who venture out to the North Pole on the world 's first carbon neutral and organic expeditions But the pals whose idea of facing the extremities is camping in the Pennines are in for a shock as they face challenges from angry polar bears to cocky Norweigans Beyond the Pole may be facing tough competition at the box office from the likes of Scorsesse 's Shutter Island and Matt Damon starrer Green Zone but it has already won a cult following on social networking site Facebook gaining 5 000 fans and awards at the Ft Lauderdale International Film Festival Describing the 14-week low budget shoot in Greenland David a ed We shot it at a hunter 's village which had around 300 residents who were all armed to the teeth they actually turned out to be very friendly We also had to be armed because of the polar bears it 's difficult when the bears are around and you have to have one more take because the actors need to be a lot more funny It was a tough shoot but a beautiful place to film Beyond the Pole runs at the Cornerhouse from March 19 to 26 
Flights from London to DC via Frankfurt (d on t ask why just learn from my mistake and never do it ) put the recent Atlantic and New Yorker profiles of Tim Geithner in a good light Longer than they needed to be you say I was wishing they were longer Josh Green was better on Geithner 's character I thought and John Cassidy more at home with the economics Both pieces are well worth reading regardless of your itinerary But I have to say that neither really dispelled for me the big mystery about Geithner which is the nature of his professional and intellectual relationship with Larry Summers When the appointments were first made I foresaw trouble Flights from London to DC via Frankfurt (d on t ask why just learn from my mistake and never do it ) put the recent Atlantic and New Yorker profiles of Tim Geithner in a good light Longer than they needed to be you say I was wishing they were longer Josh Green was better on Geithner 's character I thought and John Cassidy more at home with the economics Both pieces are well worth reading regardless of your itinerary But I have to say that neither really dispelled for me the big mystery about Geithner which is the nature of his professional and intellectual relationship with Larry Summers When the appointments were first made I foresaw trouble Like many others I assumed that Obama would have wished to make Summers Treasury Secretary but recoiled at the difficulty of getting him confirmed So Summers became chief economic adviser while his former subordinate Geithner ( whose confirmation turned out to be no stroll in the park either ) got Treasury A hazardous arrangement I thought though possibly workable if Geithner was sufficiently self-effacing to accept the de facto number two position Summers I reasoned never would But if Geithner decided he was going to be in charge there would be a fight for influence the economic message would be mu led and the loser would have to go A ing to the danger was the milling profusion of other top economic talent-Volcker Orszag Goolsbee to name just three-in or around the White House This setting reminded me of the fight between Nigel Lawson the brains behind the Thatcher Revolution and Alan Walters Thatcher 's favorite economist in the late 1980s-a calamity I watched at close quarters Lawson was chancellor of the exchequer when Thatcher brought Walters into 10 Downing St as her personal adviser They disagreed about monetary policy after a period of friction Lawson decided he was no longer trusted to do his job and quit You could plausibly argue ( and many did at the time ) that this was the beginning of the end of Thatcherism 
Islamic banks have been operating like other traditional bank about four decades They also mobilize deposits and produce loans based on Islamic Law (S hari ah ) which are different from the other conventional or commercial banks Therefore Islamic banking differs from conventional banking in several ways such as the prohibition of transactions based on interest rate and the requirement that bank 's operations be carried out according to certain procedures through the use of certain financial instruments (1) However the Islamic bank can also offer products and services which are similar to those offered by a conventional bank Generally we can define the Islamic bank as a non-interest based financial institution which complies fully with Islamic Laws and has creative and progressive financial engineering to offer efficient and competitive banking investment trade finance commercial and real estate financing services (1) There are approximately 180 Islamic Banks and Financial Institutions operating in Asia Africa Europe and the USA with more than 8 000 branches with an estimated 170 billion (2) The popularity of the Islamic banking system is not limited to the Islamic banks only Increasingly large international conventional banks are showing interest in the Islamic banking system as well (2) The consequence of this is that Islamic banks operating in Islamic countries are faced with strong competition not only from Islamic banks but also from non-Islamic rivals (3) When competition intensifies and when banks start to offer more or less similar products and services it is the customer 's satisfaction that can influence the performance of an Islamic bank and determines its competitiveness and success Hence it is of paramount importance to assess the degree of customer satisfaction towards Islamic banks operating in Islamic countries

Another groundbreaking medical procedure The teabaggers are spot on that socialized health care never produces anything good and is a complete failure Every good teabagger knows that the US health care system is the best in the world and nothing else is even close Provided you ignore all of the advances of course When faced with examples of advances the key is to simply re-state the US has the greatest health care system in the world louder or maybe write that on a poster with a picture of Obama as some evil character That ll win em over every time Not so surprisingly they have discovered gaps in regulation Imagine that Business was allowed to do whatever they wanted during the Bush years Self-regulation and all that nonsense failed yet another industry Glad to see they re serious about this Glad to see the attempts to block this video by Nestlé were defeated Like the countless stories in recent years ago lead in toys or other harmful products introduced along the supply chain process Nestlé is being targeted by Greenpeace because of the alleged ties to a company that is destroying the habitat of the endangered orangutan in Indonesia Nestlé probably did Greenpeace a favor in making this an even bigger story by trying to use their legal team to stop the video Remember it 's the best and brightest who go to work for these big corporates Read More 
I gave a talk at the New Museum in New York City on Saturday along with Omar Wasow the co-founder of Black Planet It was good fun Omar and I are nerds of the same generation and as he showed slides of his beloved VIC-20 I found myself throwing devil horns in a gesture of 8-bit solidarity The talk was sparsely attended Which is to say the two friends from Global Voices who came to support me represented a third of the paying audience And while this can be a bit dispiriting Lova Rakotomalala was kind enough not only to attend but to videotape the beginning of the discussion which is now posted on his blog ( For those of you who can t get enough video of me and frankly you should seek professional help Saturday 's talk was descended in part from my Berkman talk on mapping infrastructure and flow available here ) And the conversation Omar Lova Solana Larsen and others had afterwards at the museum and later over drinks made for an extremely rewarding seminar experience if not the grand NYC lecture I might have been hoping for Anyway the talk tried to draw a line between the idea that we should study what people actually do online rather than what we might hope they would do to the phenomenon of social translation As I put slides together I kept coming back to a talk Zhang Lei gave at the China Internet Research conference He was making the argument that while Chinese-speaking internet users may now represent the largest group of internet users there 's probably much less Chinese-language content than English language As Lei admitted we don t really know that this is true however It 's really hard to get an answer to the question What percent of the internet is in English In Chinese Near as I can tell the last time anyone made a serious rigorous attempt to answer the question was a study by Excite AtHome in 1999 which looked at 600 million webpages and concluded that 72 % were in English ( If I 'm wrong and missing the obvious definitive study please let me know in the comments would love to know about it ) I haven t found that study but it 's referred to in an excellent piece in the American Prospect Will the Internet Always Speak English and might be part of the study announced here which looks at a wide range of research questions around a corpus of Excite data If Excite 's estimates were right and the Internet was 72 % English in 1999 it 's probably much less so now in the past decade the ITU estimates that internet penetration has almost tripled and much of this growth has been in countries where English isn t the predominant language The rise of read / write web technologies like blogs have made it far easier for people to author content in their native languages While the NITLE blog census last updated in 2003 saw English followed by Catalan ( ) as the dominant languages in the blogosphere Technorati 's State of the Live Web in 2007 saw English as a plurality roughly tied with Japanese and I believe Technorati 's methods missed lots of Chinese blogs and undercounted them Still 
Diary of a Wimpy Kid is a likable movie for kids that will make adults chuckle as well because of the movie 's key ingredient -- wit This usually gets left off the To Do list by most filmmakers who aim at young audiences However director Thor Freudenthal and multiple writers have retained from their source material -- a cartoon novel by Jeff Kinney -- the sly painfully observant perspective of its pint-sized protagonist His commentary recalls for most adults our ambivalent memories of mi le school an era over which no one suffers from any nostalgia If indeed Kinney 's book sold 28 million copies and was translated into 33 languages then clearly this Fox release has name recognition So the studio can expect above-average boxoffice results for a PG-rated film Opening weekend should come in at around 15 million Zachary Gordon plays the Wimpy Kid aka Greg Heffley who keeps a journal -- don t call it a diary since that 's so-o-o-o-o wimpy -- of his mi le-school career so that when he is famous he won t have to answer questions about his early years What he charts is his luckless engagement with a class system more stratified and unyielding than those in medieval times It 's a world divided among the cool moronic bullying and wimpy where lunchtime seating is rigidly controlled and an invisible list of where one fits in the hierarchy of popularity is carried in every child 's head In his first year Greg plummets to the bottom of that list His problems is that he 's conceited judgmental and error-prone Plus he 's got a friend named Rowley ( Robert Capron ) who is oversized and seemingly oblivious if not impervious to his social standing Whatever Greg does Rowley 's counteractions will defeat Greg 's problem don t end there Greg has an older brother from hell (D evan Bostick ) clueless parents (S teve Zahn and Rachael Harris mostly wasted in negligible roles ) and the worst sort of arch-nemesis -- a girl ( Laine MacNeill ) who can beat him up Badly Then there is the movie 's gun ready to go off A molding slice of cheese lying all year on the blacktop that if touched renders that unfortunate student an immediate pariah An episodic screenplay by Jackie Filgo Jeff Filgo Gabe Sachs and Jeff Judah careens from one situation to another to provide an ever escalating series of disappointments for a kid determined win the title of class favorite in at least one area of endeavor Some running gags run too long some episodes are less successful than others and many are wholly predictable in terms of outcome Nevertheless Freudenthal keeps the pace steady and is surrounded by bright young actors who are professional enough to pep up even those sequences where the story lags 
I was looking for my younger self Perhaps he is like the man in Chris Marker 's La Jetée a film that he openly admired about the mutability of memory In La Jetée the man via the peculiarities of time travel realises that as a boy he had witnessed his own death In Miracles via the peculiarities of auto ( bio ) graphy Ballard time travels with the ongoing revelation that as a boy Lunghua was the map of his future Miracles then reunites his younger self with the older man allowing Ballard to again see through young Jim 's eyes viewing his own impending death with detached yet remarkably clear vision In 2006 I interviewed Jim Ballard I was nervous at the thought of matching wits with this towering figure but my anxiety was quickly banished for he was a charming and generous conversationalist Although taxed from the recent discovery of the cancer that would claim him he applied his blowtorch intelligence to everything from CSI and the soft fascism of consumer culture to the surreality of having an English queen as an Australian head of state weaving such cultural flashpoints in among the warps and wefts of a philosophy that has sustained his writing across 19 novels and around 100 short stories Performing a similar function but in reverse his wonderful memoir contextualises some of the darkest and strangest corners of his fiction as elements hotwired into his life It was never easy perhaps not even possible for Ballard to separate his life from his work Nominally English he was born in Shanghai and lived in the expatriate community there before being interned in 1943 with his family in Lunghua a Japanese war camp He didn t see England until he was 16 Accordingly the Shanghai years and the squalor and horror of Lunghua take up almost half of Miracles an index to its deep psychological fissures Marguerite Duras once said she only truly recognised herself in her novels not the biographies written about her Perhaps Ballard felt the same Like Duras who also wrote iterative fictionalised accounts of her expatriate upbringing in Saigon he has practised a form of time travel throughout his career most famously in the 1984 novel Empire of the Sun reinhabiting his Lunghua memories in numerous stories blurring the edges in each incarnation incrementally shifting the background scenery erasing forever the demarcation between fiction and reality The summoning of memory is a key theme in Miracles But it is memory that becomes hopelessly irrevocably contaminated with the writer 's imaginative life The su en death of his wife Mary in 1964 takes up barely a page but Ballard 's dream of her returning to his world to say goodbye takes up considerably more as does a discussion of his experimental novel The Atrocity Exhibition which Ballard has said was in part his attempt to sublimate the hurt and anger he felt at losing Mary so unexpectedly Motifs from Ballard 's fiction bleed into the autobiographical frame reversing the process set in train by Empire s 
Georgia absolutely hammered Russia in the European Nations Cup Qualifier running out easy 36 8 winners Both teams had already qualified for the 2011 Rugby World Cup in New Zealand but the result means that Georgia will play against Scotland England and Argentina in Pool B while Russia will face Australia Ireland Italy and most intriguingly the United States in Pool C Full match report to follow plus news of the Romania Portugal match but on this performance it looks like Georgia will be a handful in next year 's World Cup The British press are reporting that British troops will take part in this year 's Victory Day Parade in Red Square on May 9th They ll be joining troops from America France and of course Russia to mark the 65th anniversary of the end of the second world war According to the British Embassy Research suggests that this is the first time British troops have marched on Red Square How much research they actually did is pretty questionable considering that this picture was taken less than three years ago They re marching and playing in the first Russian Military Tattoo also known as the Kremlin Zoria Festival which took place in 2007 If you look carefully you can see representatives from the 1st Battalion Scots Guards the Royal Scots Borderers the Black Watch the Highlanders the Royal Gurkha Rifles the Royal Air Force and the Royal Corps of Signals Plus a whole host of military musicians from other Commonwealth countries British marching bands were set to attend the second Tattoo in 2008 as well but the Russia-Georgia war put paid to that plan Much more about the Moscow Military Tattoo here including links to lots more pictures Here 's my absolute favourite This weekend sees Georgia play Russia in the deciding match of the 2008-2010 European Nations Cup Season Russia have been playing second fi le to Georgia all season but Romania 's shock defeat of Georgia last week means that Russia and Georgia are now level on points at the top of the table and all is to play for To a a little more pressure to this match between the two massive rivals ( if more was needed between two countries that fought a war only eighteen months ago ) the outcome of the match will decide who qualifies in first place for next year 's Rugby World Cup Finals in New Zealand Both teams have already qualified but the team who finishes first in the European Nations Cup will find themselves in the tougher World Cup group which creates an o ly perverse incentive for each team to throw the game This weekend also sees a vital matchup between Romania and Portugal the winner of which is likely to take the third and final World Cup Qualifying spot As ever we ll have the results for you here on Siberian Light next week 
This amazing piece of musical scholarship must be one of the most sublime pieces of obsession ever committed to print Edited by Rutgers University scholar and musician ( and Coltrane biographer ) Lewis Porter it is the work of a team of scholars and fans to collate everything known about saxophonist and composer John Coltrane The book is broken down into two lengthy sections Part One The Chronology which tracks Coltrane 's life and music from his birth in Hamlet North Carolina in 1926 to his death in Long Island in 1967 The Chronology tracks recording dates and personnel as well as tours and live concerts and major events in Coltrane 's life The music is taken in even greater detail in Part Two The Discography which lists all known recording sessions and live performances in chronological order While this would probably strike some as a dry list of facts what makes this book even more valuable are the anecdotes that the researchers have collected from fellow musicians and from the media For example did you know that one evening at the Half Note in 1964 Coltrane wasn t feeling well after the first set of a gig so he sat out the second set allowing Eric Dolphy and Albert Ayler who had apparently been practicing together earlier in the afternoon take his place Can you imagine The mind reels just thinking about it Critic Gary Gi ins 's reaction to the joyful terrifying noise of Coltrane 's band in 1966 is fascinating as well as the re-prints of newspaper advertisements for the band 's upcoming gigs This was a fascinating book to flip through and a very impressive work of scholarship and research this is endlessly interesting for both music fans and scholars Inspired by the work of the great Duke Ellington and his combination of horns and reeds bassist and composer Dave Holland formed an octet to investigate a wide range of musical textures and colors Anchored by his quintet with Chris Potter on tenor and soprano saxophone Steve Nelson on vibes and marimba Nate Smith on drums and Robin Eubanks on trombone he a 's Antonio Hart on alto saxophone Alex Sipiagin on trumpet and Gary Smulyan on baritone saxophone The album was recorded live during a week long stand at Birdland in New York City Pathways opens the album with deep baritone saxophone leading the melody Smulyan solos with the rest of the horns filling in for support The horns riff hard with vibes accenting before trumpet takes over How 's Never has a feature for solo bass before the band kicks in Hart 's alto saxophone digs deep in a strong solo before making way for a cool vibraphone bass and drums section and an exciting drum solo Chris Potter and Robin Eubanks are featured on Sea of Marmara with Potter 's soprano saxophone shimmering like a golden sunrise and then switching to tenor saxophone on Ebb and Flow to take a stirring feature propelled by blustery horns 
From the customer 's perspective it 's all the same If it 's provided over the Internet on a pay-for-usage basis it 's a cloud service Within the industry we argue about definitions more than is good for us Customers look in from the outside and see a much simpler array of choices Why is this important It matters to how we market and support cloud services ( of whatever ilk ) Yesterday EuroCloud UK (d isclosure of which I 'm chair ) had a member meeting hosted at SAP UK headquarters that covered various aspects of the transition to SaaS for ISVs From the title you d imagine it would have little content of relevance to raw cloud providers at the infrastructure-as-a-service layer ( One of our challenges in the early days of EuroCloud whose founders are more from the SaaS side of things is to make sure we bring the infrastructure players on board with us ) But in fact much of the discussion covered topics of equal interest at any level of the as-a-service stack How to work with partners How to compensate sales teams What sort of contract to offer customers How to reconcile paying for resources on a pay-per-use basis with a per-seat licence fee What instrumentation and reporting of service levels should the provider 's infrastructure include 
It 's hard to look at the DROID without looking at the company which brought the device to life Motorola for years the name has been synonymous with well disappointment While the industry-stalwart made cellphones sexy with the RAZR the days which followed have not been especially fruitful or compelling Over the past year or so we ve seen Motorola beating its way back into the mainstream through a series of smart plays first embracing Android as a platform then shucking off the weight of Windows Mobile and finally bringing some desirable ( and high profile ) devices to market With the DROID the company has perhaps created its most attractive and intriguing piece of technology yet Forging an alliance with both Verizon and Google Motorola has come up with a second compelling reason to count the phonemaker down but certainly not out while the other two giants have finally found a seemingly worthy device to position against the iPhone So we must pose these questions is this the phone which will catapult Android into the mainstream Is it the device that will pull Motorola back from the brink And -- most importantly -- is it the lynchpin Google and Verizon have needed to challenge the leader in mindshare in the smartphone market After putting the device through its paces we think we can give you the answers you seek -- so read on to find out 
Our ship has once again been repelled by sea ice this time more ominously than before We now know for certain that we will not reach Larsen B It 's hard to imagine how disappointed these scientists must feel They ve been planning this expedition for three years Their careers depend on it The Nathaniel B Palmer has gone as far south as it can without becoming trapped in ice and now sits in a sheltered apron of sea ice between James Ross Island and Lockyer Island Most of our scientific targets on the former Larsen B Ice Shelf lie 70 to 100 miles south beyond helicopter range Scientists and crew are making plans to use our helos together with strategically placed fuel caches to extend our range and leapfrog scientific instruments to the most important of our targets If it works it will have been a heroic effort In the meantime we re collecting data from yet another dead ice shelf a lobe of the former Larsen A Ice Shelf which once flowed out of Swift Glacier on James Ross Island and covered the area where our ship now is This little ice shelf was last seen alive and well in 1843 by 1945 it had shrunk by half and by 1957 it had vanished entirely Some scientists question how substantial this ice shelf really was A core of mud that our crew extracted from the seafloor sheds light on this Three feet of sand sit at the top of the core just the kind of stuff that 's vomited forth when ice shelves disintegrate and the glaciers they once supported run out of control like 18-wheelers without brakes Below the sand sits gray clay profoundly empty of diatoms or any other sign of life It suggests that before the ice shelf went this area spent thousands of years beneath a thick ice shelf that blotted out sunlight and prevented all but the hardiest things from eking out a living As we sit here in the ice the seasons are changing as evidenced by the eroding daylight During a late summer 's Antarctic night we received our first snowstorm Wind wafted the falling flakes into waves Several inches of snow gathered on the ship 's decks At 2 a m I wandered out onto the bow and recognized true darkness for the first time in weeks Only the lights of the ship and three flood lamps throwing circles of light onto the wind-sculpted ice A dozen white-winged snow petrels cruised in clockwise orbits around the ship skimming inches above the snow just at the edge of our little snow globe of light The birds zoomed by our port side with the wind at their backs then levitated as they turned into the wind beating their wings hard to regain momentum I 'm told that snow petrels will sometimes follow ice breakers as they crash through sea ice snatching up hapless little krill that are thrown onto the ice in front of the ship But with the ship at a standstill their cavorting seemed a waste of energy in this cold and harsh ( if also kind of pretty ) environment it 's not as though they were catching fireflies Two birds of another kind also inhabited our summer nightscape two emperor penguins sleeping on the ice just off starboard To find respite from predators such as leopard seals these birds routinely haul out of the water and flop face-first into the snow where they sleep Our two emperors looked still and dead like minor characters in some old western who d taken gunshots in the back and fallen forward into the dust The snow formed drifts around their little black bodies One has to wonder whether this place was throwing us one last taunt as it chased us out of town Or perhaps offering a quiet moment of consolation 
As you know there 's an abundance of horribly written corporate websites out there with too much back slapping self praise and not enough focus on the customer For us copywriters this presents an opportunity if you can point out to a company why their website 's copy is ineffective they might ask you to give it a makeover Many companies complain about how poor their websites are at generating sales - often weak copy is to blame Here are a few classic corporate web copywriting mistakes you might want to point out Irrelevant copy that wastes visitors time You know the sort packed with meaningless marketing clichés paradigm shift modular best of breed solutions blah blah blah Copy that 's not focused on the reader is more likely to cause yawns and glazed eyes than people hopping in theirs seats about a product 's benefits No structure or call to action Every page should have an point of what it wants the reader to think or do Rather than endlessly boast about market leading solutions the copy should be creating an image in people 's minds of how a product can solve their problem As you know hitting people 's emotional buttons is a time proven way of persuading them to respond to a call to action ( which is another key element many corporate web page 's are missing ) Copywriting by committee In theory asking people from different areas of a company to contribute to what the website needs to say makes sense But you then often end up with the website 's copy becoming drowned in track changes and amendments Yes getting feedback is important But it should then be one person 's responsibility to pull all the elements together into a concisely written website page Copy pasted from the corporate brochure People skim read online and have the attention spans of goldfish So web copy needs to use short sentences short paragraphs plenty of subheads bullet pointed lists and provide succinct usable summaries The internet is also a robotic medium So a ressing the reader as you and writing copy in an approachable tone can help it sound more human Ideally pages should be kept to less than 300 words You can always use arrows or drill down menus to break up long pages into more digestible chunks Hasn t been split tested Not sure which headline or call to action works best Try split testing the page to find out Google 's Website Optimizer will do the trick Too many keywords ( or not enough ) SEO is a complicated beast and has evolved a lot since the days of hi en text and keyword stuffing But you still need enough words in the right places to make sure Google knows what your page is about Luckily there are some great tools out there for finding out whether your copy 's on the right track - SEOBugz is one tool I use regularly So if you ve got a spare window next week have a look at corporate websites in your area to see which are making these mistakes to drum up some business Any corporate web copywriting mistakes you d a 
esterday CBO and the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation ( JCT ) completed a preliminary estimate of the direct spending and revenue effects of the reconciliation proposal that represents one component of the health care legislation being considered by the Congress The other component is a bill H R 3590 that the Senate passed in December CBO and JCT estimate that enacting the combination of the reconciliation proposal and H R 3590 as passed by the Senate would reduce federal budget deficits by 138 billion between 2010 and 2019 Although CBO does not generally provide cost estimates beyond the 10-year budget projection period many Members have requested our analysis of the long-term budgetary impact of broad changes in the nation 's health care and health insurance systems Therefore we have developed a rough outlook for the decade following the 2010-2019 period We estimate that the combined effect of enacting those two pieces of legislation would be to reduce federal budget deficits during that following decade relative to those projected under current law with a total effect that is in a broad range around one-half percent of gross domestic product ( GDP ) That calculation is very uncertain and the imprecision of the estimate is intended to reflect that uncertainty Many people have raised questions about those projections of deficit reduction and similar projections that we have made regarding earlier pieces of health legislation Their questions often focus either on the uncertainties surrounding the various technical behavioral and economic factors underlying the estimates or on uncertainties as to whether the legislation would ultimately be implemented as written Some analysts believe that CBO is underestimating the ultimate costs of the new subsidies to buy health insurance ( which could make the legislation deficit-increasing instead of deficit-reducing ) Others assert that CBO is underestimating the ultimate savings from changes in the Medicare program ( which could make the legislation reduce deficits by more than we have estimated ) Certainly the budgetary impact of broad changes in the nation 's health care and health insurance systems is very uncertain However CBO staff in consultation with outside experts has devoted a great deal of care and effort to this analysis and the agency strives to develop estimates that reflect the mi le of the distribution of possible outcomes As a result we believe that CBO 's estimates of the net savings that would result from the legislation have a roughly equal chance of turning out to be too high or too low Focusing on another area of concern some observers argue that CBO 's estimates are unrealistic because the Congress will not allow the Medicare spending cuts and future tax increases in the proposals to take effect CBO 's responsibility to the Congress is to estimate the effects of proposals as written and not to forecast future legislation However the agency does try to provide information about the consequences of implementing proposals For example our cost estimate for the bill taken up by the Senate in December and our estimate for the House bill last October noted that inflation-adjusted Medicare spending per beneficiary would slow sharply under those proposals We estimated that growth in such spending under the Senate bill would drop from about 4 percent per year for the past two decades to roughly 2 percent per year for the next two decades whether such a reduction could be achieved through greater efficiencies in the delivery of health care or would reduce access to care or diminish the quality of care is unclear In a ition CBO 's estimates have shown that relaxing previously enacted constraints on Medicare spending can a significantly to long-run budget deficits as we wrote in answer to a question last fall about the effects of combining the House bill with a change in the so-called Sustainable Growth Rate mechanism for Medicare 's payments to physicians 
Every six months or so Flip Video--slated to be absorbed by Cisco by the end of the year--puts out a new model or two of its popular YouTube-friendly point-and-shoot mini camcorders Late last year it was the MinoHD Now for spring 2009 the company brings us two updated versions of the Ultra a higher-end model the UltraHD which shoots 720p (1 280x720 ) high-definition video and a less expensive Ultra which shoots 640x480 VGA video On the outside at least not much has changed from Flip 's first-generation Ultra But there are a couple of notable differences For starters the transflective LCD on the back is bigger measuring 2 inches compared with 1 5 inches The buttons are also bigger and the UltraHD which comes in black or white has a sort of rubberized matte finish that allows you to grip the device a bit more easily Most importantly this model comes with a set of AA-size NiMH rechargeable batteries you can charge in the unit by simply connecting the camcorder ( via its trademark flip-out USB connector ) to the USB port on your computer Alternatively you can swap in a pair of standard AA alkaline batteries if you don t have time to charge That standard battery backup option is a nice convenience but there 's a drawback the batteries are bulkier and heavier than the slim lithium ion type built into the MinoHD So by default you re getting a bigger heavier camcorder--the UltraHD weighs 6 1 ounces versus 3 3 ounces for the MinoHD That said the UltraHD is still pocket-friendly just not as pocket-friendly as the MinoHD One thing we don t like about the new design is the chrome plastic trim on the sides of the unit It looks good but you ll find your self continually wiping off fingerprint smudges with the soft velvety pouch that ships with the product We would have preferred some sort of brushed metal or a brushed-metal look Another minor ding there 's an HDMI output on the side for HDTV connections but no bundled cable That 's not a huge deal but Kodak for instance includes an HDMI cable with the Zx1 which retails for about 50 less 
The Xphone IIm takes the existing form factor of the Xphone II and gives it an iPod-style makeover Depending on your personal preferences that 's either a canny marketing decision or a cynical bit of cheap design trickery The silver and grey styling of the buttons and sides of the phone don t sit quite as well with the otherwise glossy white colour scheme of the phone although again that 's a matter of personal preference The Xphone IIm is a candybar form factor smartphone that 's fairly reminiscent of most of Sony Ericsson 's designs right down to the largish 2 2 inch screen and small button array Most functions are controlled via the tiny directional joystick that sits in the mi le of the phone in the same style as the Xphone II itself The major button difference between the IIm and II is the a ition of four dedicated function buttons These are mapped to Internet Explorer and Windows Media Player functions The Xphone IIm weighs in at 106 5g with battery and measures 46 83 x 107 76 x 19 58 mm The real advantage with this style of smartphone over the massed army of iPaq form factor clones is that they ll fit comfortably in any pocket and don t immediately look like a PDA - although that 's an approach that does have its drawbacks which we ll get to shortly Features As a phone the Xphone IIm is a tri-band GSM phone with GPRS capabilities and Bluetooth connectivity The whole platform 's running on the somewhat aging Microsoft Windows Mobile 2003 Smartphone Edition software which both manages usual phone functionality as well as PDA-style applications The IIm also features an integrated VGA camera located on the back of the phone The supplied application package - predominantly Pocket Outlook and Internet Explorer - isn t that exciting in PDA terms although at least running on the Windows Mobile 2003 platform means that there 's plenty of potential a -on software out there to bolster the phone 's capabilities The trick there however will be making sure that you can control said software via the tiny joystick as the IIm offers no touchscreen capabilities unlike larger PDA-style smartphones Performance There 's not too much that can be said about the IIm 's phone performance as it worked well enough during our testing for both phone calls and SMS / MMS messaging Our one complaint is a relatively minor one in that while the phone itself supports Windows Media player it doesn t support MP3 ring tones quite how annoying you ll find that is up to you As a PDA the IIm has some distinct drawbacks centred mainly around the mandatory use of the joystick It takes quite a bit of use to get accustomed to using the joystick for menu navigation especially if you re used to touchscreen smartphones If you re in possession of small and nimble fingers you ll have no problems with the IIm 's joystick but our rather meatier digits found it irksome especially as it 's all too easy to hit the function buttons above it by accident when scrolling upwards There are also some applications such as the normally highly a ictive Jawbreaker that work very poorly through a joystick interface 
Mainly the New Israel Fund supports groups that work to ensure that Israel remains a democracy and it surely represents American Jewish values of tolerance pluralism and diversity as well as support for Israel as a Jewish state I don t think Andrew is necessarily a bellwether on this -- he 's a bit too mercurial -- but as a general proposition I think Hounshell has it right It seems as if many people in the American elite have decided that Israel is just as dysfunctional ( and sometimes as brutal ) as its Arab foes Americans don t like intractable crises and the Israeli government needs to understand this ( it needs to understand as well that young American Jews are less likely to be reflexive defenders of Israel than their parents are ) At the risk of repeating myself ( unavoidable on a blog I guess ) it will be risky for Israel to pull out its settlements from the West Bank but it will be fatal for Israel to remain in the settlements for moral and demographic reasons What Israel needs is a leader who will step forward and say Here is the way things should look and then present an outline for the creation of a viable Palestine The settlers will go nuts but that 's what they do Hamas will go nuts because that 's what it does But Hounshell is right What is needed is a Rabin I tend to think that Netanyahu has the potential to be this leader Maybe it 's more a hope than a reality at this point but only someone from the right can bring the majority of Israelis to the painful compromises that are obviously necessary And to make the obvious point one of the reasons this compromise is necessary is because American public opinion is one of Israel 's most important battlegrounds Andrew Sullivan 's response to Leon Wieseltier 's criticism is here I 'm reading it carefully and so I don t want to comment much at all now I agree with Andrew that he 's not anti-Semitic as I ve written I also think that for whatever reason he doesn t recognize the severity of his language on Israel and Jewish matters over the past year For instance he doesn t seem to recognize the implications of his call for the U S to impose a military solution on Israel and have the American army forcibly dismantle settlements In other words he 's opposed to military action against Iran but he 's for military action against Israel Let me put it this way This is not how a friend constructively criticizes Israel And he doesn t recognize at least from what I ve read so far that his analysis of the Mi le East crisis is consistently and rather wildly one-sided For instance he recently wrote Without a permanent cessation of such (s ettlement ) activity there 's no way to get the two sides together But Israel simply refuses to cooperate as it has refused for two decades in its land-grab 
Patrick is a Canadian born designer who at 19 produced his first pair of shoes for Loucas Kleanthous a Toronto based designer Loucas encouraged Patrick to go to design school Not one to let his studies get in the way of his education Patrick through his partying made friends with Vivienne Westwood and John Galliano who were rising fashion stars at the time Vivienne had him design the shoes for her Clint Eastwood collection in 1984 and designed the shoes for Galliano 's Fallen Angels collection in 1986 and continued to work with Galliano for six years I tried to find photos of those two collections but failed He designed the prototype for Vivienne Westwood 's shoes that tripped up Naomi Campbell on the Paris Catwalk in 1993 Here are more Patrick Cox shoes for you via PatrickCox com In 2008 he sold most of his company to Fast E ie Davenport because the recession hit the business hard then in 2009 there was talk about litigation I hope Mr Cox is able to salvage his company So I have been idly watching Carey Mulligan the twenty five year old British actress because she seems to have a great sense of style ( Her stylist is Tiina Laakkonen who has a good artistic eye ) She seems to like Prada and Lanvin but has been seen wearing other designers too I went back a few months to show you what she has been wearing She is a tiny tiny girl so she has to watch that her clothes don t overpower her I think she has done that October 2009 wearing a gladiator-ish stu ed dress from the Prada Fall 2009 with Prada sandals I love the red lips August 2010 At the MOCA 30th Anniversary Gala wearing Prada from the Spring 2010 line shoes fron the same collection These shoes have that clear Lucite heel This is probably the most amazing skirt around August 2010 At the MOCA 30th Anniversary Gala wearing Prada from the Spring 2010 line shoes fron the same collection These shoes have that clear Lucite heel This is probably the most amazing skirt around February 2010 at the BAFTAs in Vionnet dress YSL shoes This is the second Vionnet dress Carey has worn She wore a gorgeous red dress and nude Vionnet pumps on October 2009 for the premier of An Education in London Galligator told us abut this design house a few months ago Apparently Anna Wintour has taken a liking to Carey The story Carey tells is that Anna said I should wear short for the Oscars I was like No that is so not what I had in my head when I was six years old For the Oscars she went long even with a train ( I guess not everyone does what Ms Wintour says ) She wore a Prada dress with Prada sandals The dress got mixed reviews I think she looked great This is what she wears on her day off This photo was taken the day after the Oscars Trapeze smock brown jersey pants and black ballet shoes Just the right outfit for Los Angeles It will be fun to what she and Tiina decide for the Costume Institute Gala and Cannes It will undoubtably be beautiful 
Y know listening to this and thinking back it doesn t strike me that Alexandra Burke - a self-confessed fan of the ba er boy - would be at all pleased if she bought a new dress and her fella failed to notice would she I mean come on she 's a pop star She went on a TV talent show in order to get constant feedback and praise from the British public every week The very least she is going to expect from a man is the ability to tell her she looks hot in her new frock That need for attention drives her every move as it does for everyone Heck even bad boys like Skepta do what they do partly because they re not supposed to and it makes people look Or at least they SAY they do the things they do because of that There is a difference ( Here 's the video Oh so THAT S why they call you a bad boy ) The key to talking about how much of a scallywag you are and making it appealing for everyone to listen to lies in how much fun you can make it sound You have to know that what you re doing is not very nice and kind of half-laugh at how ridiculous you are It 's a skill and luckily Skepta is very much the man for the job Listen to him brag about treating his woman poorly Does he sound sad about it No But does he sound like he thinks she deserves to be treated this way Also no This is very important He kind of gets off on the fact that he 's a rotten swine but at least he knows right from wrong and as most of it is relayed from her perspective it 's not like her feelings are being totally dismissed That sai dI know she knows I know she ain t the one is pretty harsh * disapproving fingerwag * Also this scores with me because it owes a sonic debt to Underworld 's Born Slippy in the chorus That 's always a good thing but don t tell Skapta he ll only change it or something the shameless rogue

In recent years cyber gangs have been careful to spread their operations across multiple Internet service providers a tactic that makes it much harder for law enforcement and security administrators to track organized crime activity But new research shows that gathering data from various places including anti-malware and anti-spam companies and phishing blacklists makes it possible to identify dense clusters of ISPs that that appear to be overly tolerant of malicious activity This pattern was particularly evident in Eastern Europe and the Mi le East Researchers from Indiana University at Bloomington and the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Oak Ridge TN compared the data from a variety of sources that measure ISP reputation from different perspectives Security organizations tend to measure online threats differently depending on their geographic location and focus The study includes information on phishing websites from Phishtank com and the Anti-Phishing Working Group botnet data from the Shadowserver Foundation spam data from Indiana University Spamhaus SURBL and Support Intelligence and malware hosting stats from organizations such as CleanMX eSoft and Malware Patrol Craig Shue a cyber security research scientist at the Oak Ridge National Lab said the group agreed not to name the hosts and ISPs they determined were malicious in return for a look at the different data sets Shue 's employer as well as several organizations that contributed data were concerned about being sued for criticizing particular ISPs 
IDEO 's Bill Moggridge made a comment last week after a screening of Objectified that hit close to home To paraphrase he said interaction design has become pervasive that anyone and everyone can be an interaction designer and so the role of professional interaction designer is ( or is becoming ) unnecessary So is Interaction Design a dead-end job As an expertise no But as a discrete service offering or a career path I say absolutely This position has not made me any new friends around the office but to be clear I 'm not suggesting our profession is akin to flipping burgers at the mall Instead it 's that interaction design has reached a point of maturity where growth is constrained I see three major factors behind this and hope that by acknowledging them we can find a way forward 1 Developers get it The practice of interaction design grew from the need to present software experiences to users in a way that makes sense meets their needs is consistent and coherent and usable and ultimately desirable Other actors in the creation of software from senior management to product managers to developers had little exposure to these values nor the abilities to deliver on them The landscape is much different today Developers have a much stronger sense of good and appropriate interactions Entire development methodologies revolve around delivering value to users by understanding their needs There are many developers and development-driven organizations with little or no professional Interaction Design involvement making good software Modern development frameworks provide a strong baseline for producing interfaces and interactions that in the past required a skilled interaction designer to realize On iPhone for example while it 's certainly hard to produce great experiences it 's just as difficult to produce bad UI On the Web AJAX libraries offer very usable UI patterns right out of the box and greatly reduce the custom design and coding efforts required to build good online applications So from the software side as the level of interaction design awareness and quality continues to improve throughout development organizations Interaction Designers are no longer as frequently or as heavily needed to bring a successful product to market 2 Interaction is not an on-screen activity Another factor is the emergence of more direct input and feedback mechanisms in today 's software-enabled devices Interaction designers are vital to help translate between human and computer when interfaces are composed of virtual abstractions with no corresponding physical affordances to aid comprehension As software manipulation becomes more natural the work of designing appropriate interactions moves from the screen out to the device as a whole Design of physical devices has traditionally been the purview of industrial designers a profession with its own long history of considering context and user needs to design products driven by and responding to user interaction And industrial design education today can include much of the same user-centered design training familiar to interaction designers So from the hardware side Interaction Designers are encroaching upon an established discipline with deeper roots and a better understanding of physical materials and human ergonomics

Sales IT have a lot in common The thing that you learn from sales and can take back into the IT world is that every customer is different Every customer has a unique set of challenges in terms of how you communicate how you work with that individual company or customer To be an effective CIO leader you must understand the different parts of the various groups you serve The way you speak to the head of sales is different from the way you speak to the head of operations the CFO or the head of R D In order to be effective leading IT business transformation and change you have to understand what various leaders are trying to do within their own business area align with that and then communicate the value that IT brings If you start talking to the head of sales about IT or operational metrics they ll glaze over very quickly If you go in talking to them about how am I going to help you drive sales how am I going to help you drive sales productivity or lead management you ll have a much better reception than if you go in there and simply say we re going to implement Salesforce com and give them a project plan You need to show them you understand their challenges as well as the value proposition of what IT can bring Where a lot of IT guys get hung up is they talk about the data center is up 7 /24 and I ve got five nines reliability or I can role out projects But you know what That 's a commodity these days The real value that you have is where you understand a business unit and its key metrics I ll just take a real simple example If you re going to roll out a CRM project the sales team in general is looking for well they d say it 's really about lead management it 's about getting my contacts in a single database it 's about making my day easier No it 's not It 's about sales productivity and driving revenue 
The 1980s fashion revival is coming to a close But the revival on earlier periods particularly from the 1930s and 1940s remains popular So what to do then with the military fashion trend which has proved the stalwart of fashionisers wardrobes for the past 2 years Evolve it Play down the over-the-top glam pieces taken directly from the 80s and infuse the historical military look with something far more classic far more relevant to 2010 fashion Introducing the Autumn ( Fall ) / Winter 2010 evolution of the men 's military clothing trend The military shape always has been a fashion driven trend for the colder months but for Autumn ( Fall )/ Winter 2009-2010 designers such as Gareth Pugh Alexander McQueen John Galliano and Burberry have modified and transformed the combat uniform from the past to the now Gareth Pugh with one of the most unusual menswear collections for A / W 09-10 has brought inspiration from the likes of German officer overcoats from the Second World War to the metal chain mail suits that were worn under suits of armour Movies can also be seen as a heavy influence in Pugh 's A / W collection with feathers for shoulder decoration as inspiration from The Crow including the Gothic ripped trousers and black boots and the metallic body combat suit a similar cut to Christian Bale 's costume in Equilibrium A few short years ago tailored shorts for men were bang-on-trend we were moving firmly away from the 1990s and a refined cut of short promised a comfy distinguished yet wholly less casual look They didn t make it big everywhere a bugger to find in Australia I ventured off to Harvey Nichols in Knightsbridge for my navy pair from Paul Smith and they ve worn beautifully But for the gent wanting an updated look for their Spring / Summer 2009 wardrobe where to from here I ve spotted this a few times in our street style coverage and the latest instance comes from Sweden men pinning their blazers together either as a feature or to give an even slimmer fit There aren t all that many fashion accessories for men when one considers the sheer volume that exist for women And of those that do exist quite often you find that they re heavily associated with a sub-culture or movement that you re simply not interested in associating yourself with Brooches for men are however one of the few men 's accessories which can cross the sub-culture divides are perfect for both Spring / Summer and Autumn ( Fall )/ Winter seasons and are slowly making a come-back Men 's fashion trends are few and far between yes a lot of women 's trends are eventually adapted to the men 's market but if 2010 men 's hair trends prove anything it is that classics will always rule when it comes to men 's fashion Unsurprisingly it 's no different when it comes to men 's suits Mark my words Deep-V T-shirts are going to be the bane of men 's fashion trends in Spring-Summer 2009 And no it 's not the Viagra Not that I use it but if you want some for kicks give me a call I know a guy who knows a guy who lives in Springvale I 'm ki ing Anyway if you may have noticed this colour has been slowly sneaking its way onto the catwalks the last two winters - bright blue that is Actually I 'm not even sure what hue they re using

Seeing as there is a dry sunny day unfurling right outside my window Spring can t be far away and with it the long rumored Netflix Instant Streaming functionality creeps ever closer to Wii owners and yes by owners I mean me Truth be told this functionality is far more than a rumor It was in fact confirmed on the Netflix Blog back in January Also of course Netflix streaming is nothing new having been available for a good long while via computer and a pretty wide array of devices including Wii competitors Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 The question has got to be though why did this take so long After all with literally millions of Wiis having been sold across a very mainstream demographic in less than four years Nintendo 's device would seem the perfect hardware target It might be that Netflix was bound by exclusivity agreements in these earlier deals or perhaps it is that Nintendo didn t see video functionality as worth its time considering the Wii 's modest processing power the overall limited number of titles available via the service and / or that they would not have total control Along with possibly a little arrogance on Nintendo 's part all of these are fairly valid possibilities What is certain though is that a large number of Netflix subscribers use the streaming service not to replace the mail-based primary Netflix service but as a supplement to it Myself I have an Xbox 360 in one room and a PS3 in another both set up for streaming Like the PS3 Wii owners will need a free Netflix-supplied disc that must be inserted into the drive in order to stream content ( A Netflix unlimited account of any level and a broadband connection are also required ) The disc-in method is much more clumsy than those utilized by the other devices which either were manufactured with Netflix streaming in mind or were patched with a software updates Using the PS3 as an example it is doubtless true that the disc method both a 's a little noise to the viewing experience and uses more energy The Wii is very energy efficient and pretty quiet though so there should be few issues In a ition perhaps Nintendo will get a clue and a a Netflix channel to its Wii functionality which could eliminate the need for a disc down the road Until then a disc will do fine

The feeling of boredom that apparently never bothered them before Its even more apparent in those that have moved away temporarily with no friends or family Its like they are on a summer break from school Only difference is the time of summer break is too long or short depending on the individual in question They seem to be bitten by the summer vacation syndrome To understand this better roll back that memory film and pause it during your school days Summer time was what every one eagerly awaited But which then started to drag towards the mi le and then felt like should never end near the end No schools No work Just relaxation and play But everyone had a different summer Some visited their relatives Some spent days with their friends Some even attended summer camp Anything different from the routine of classes But then sometimes friends traveled when you wanted to play You got stuck with relatives that annoyed you Some dreaded that summer camp that they would be attending without friends and no family As we grew older the classes became longer and the vacations shorter We became used to spending time in the classroom We enjoyed it actually So much so that during vacations we missed the countless pointless hours spent with friends Though you could meet them it just wasn t the same Those who genuinely liked work got bored out of their minds But most generally realised the classroom was the best place to hang out ) Then vacations just became about catching up on pending things in personal life or catching up with relatives who by now had become less and less frequent equations in your schedule Then you go onto work and there are no vacations anymore Its just work family and friends But then some of us get that summer vacation We get sent away from family and friends Just like that summer camp when we were kids Its still the same feeling irrespective of your considerable gain in life experiences its still something that will benefit you but you would rather stick with friends back home Its still something that presents new opportunities to learn to grow but which also carries the potential of being friendless and boring But our mind by now is hardwired on how to handle summer vacations We develop hobbies to spend our time Make new friends Just like that summer camp when we were kids We find things to do that we hang onto for rest of our lives Sometimes we bump into friendships that too last forever long But just like summer camps these phases in life end too So if you are one of the people who are waiting for it to end it will end sooner than you know Those who actually flourish in a summer camp situation well this one is better because it does not need to end like the camps from your childhood Now onto my second day it was time to actually enter a few buildings I already had a lot of outdoor time when it was nice and sunny on my first day

We ve a ed a new cartoonist to cagle com Omar Abdallat from The A ustour newspaper in Jordan I 'm sure Omar 's cartoons will make some of our readers angry as he often draws bloodthirsty-monster-Israel cartoons which is common fare for cartoonists in Arab countries - but unlike some Arab cartoonists Omar draws on other subjects too and he has a nice style that our mostly American audience can easily understand ( It isn t easy to find foreign cartoonists that our American audience can understand ) I just got back from a cool editorial cartoonists conference in Colombia last week I 'm an editorial cartooning wonk and it was great fun to go to a conference where I didn t know the cartoonists In fact the Colombian political cartoonists rarely get together themselves and it was interesting for them to meet each other Bogota is a huge city of about 8 5 million people full of universities and libraries and a thriving community of cartoonists Colombian politics are crazy bloody complex and difficult for me to digest in just a week of cramming Colombia is the second biggest country in South America and the third largest recipient in the world of US foreign aid because of all the drug issues there The US State Department brought me to Colombia on a speaking tour to attend the conference as the only American cartoonist 
Luxury SUVs have become such a common sight that the notation for the 2010 Acura MDX on our schedule didn t raise much interest around the office But then we saw the thing Rather than the somewhat delicate beak-nosed vehicle of the past this one 's squarish stance and big air scoops made it look like a hardened criminal OK an exterior styling update Fine But Acuras have always seemed like upscale Hondas never embodying the real luxury found in competitive brands such as Mercedes-Benz or BMW We got in the cabin expecting to find the usual midlevel cabin appointments but were instead greeted with beautiful wood-grained trim elements and thick leather seats Facing us in the center of the dashboard was the usual Acura controller a large knob that works as a joystick and dial surrounded by buttons with an LCD above We weren t thrilled to see the same old maps on the navigation system strictly 2D with somewhat jaggy resolution showing on street names Acura 's stack looks cleaner in the MDX than in previous generations Given that Acura uses an in-dash hard drive for the navigation system we can t imagine these older generation maps take up a whole lot of space Twisting the big knob around to delve into the navigation system 's menus we found the latest Zagat listings for restaurants and one of our favorite features a database of scenic drives listed by state Entering a destination into the system proved as easy as ever the proximity of the knob to the screen making inputs seem nearly as direct as using a touch screen Maneuvering the MDX out onto the route it calculated we noticed the traffic flow and incident information overlaid on the maps and dug into the settings to ensure that the car would dynamically change the route when bad traffic cropped up The navigation system guided us through city streets its route guidance enunciating street names and the MDX proved very drivable In the madness of downtown streets where random double-parked cars and road construction require quick lane changes the MDX 's light steering and responsive low-speed acceleration helped us jump the car from lane to lane Further assisting quick maneuvering was the MDX 's blind-spot detection which lit up an icon at the base of the A-pillar when it detected a car in the lane next to us Given the high sides of the MDX cars in the next lane were often completely invisible Blind-spot detection is one of our favorite safety features and it is nice to see Acura employing it in the MDX This icon in the A-pillar lights up when a car is in the MDX 's blind spot During this excursion we had the suspension in Comfort mode which made it feel like we were driving a waterbed The car moved along with a slow motion wallow softening the ride and absorbing the bumps and pits mining the asphalt Power on At a freeway onramp we hit the gas hard to see how the MDX handled acceleration at the top end Here the 3 7-liter V-6 brought its 270 pound-feet of torque to bear spooling up the car and engine speed reaching toward 6 300rpm where the horsepower peaks at 300 This engine isn t the most high tech compared with what other automakers are offering but it does have Honda 's VTEC valve timing At freeway speeds the suspension didn t hunker down and we were still left with the soft wallow But it didn t adversely affect the handling either The steering had the usual slack built in for an SUV allowing for effortless driving Since the beginning of this drive we were eager to push the button on the console that would put the suspension into Sport mode but restrained ourselves in the interests of testing the comfort setting completely We left the transmission in its standard drive mode too holding off on using its sport setting until we found an appropriate road But flicking the pa le shifters on the steering wheel we noticed the gear indicator showing 6 Acura has finally caught up with the rest of the world installing six-speed transmissions At 70 mph the engine hummed along at a little under 2 000rpm which should improve fuel economy The EPA rating for the MDX is 16 mpg city and 21 mpg highway not particularly great numbers but the vehicle does have third-row seating In our driving which combined city mountain roads and the freeway we came in at 17 6 mpg 
Felt is a mass of wool and / or fur It is not woven but rather pressed and manipulated in a centuries-old process using heat water and pressure to create the strongest smoothest most water-resistant natural fabric known Legends abound with regard to its origin Some claim that St Clement ( the patron saint of felt hat makers ) discovered felt when as a wandering monk he filled his sandals with flax fibers to protect his feet The moisture and pressure from pounding feet compressed the fibers into crude though comfortable felt Others suggest that Native Americans or ancient Egyptians discovered felt by way of fur lined moccasins or camel hair falling into sandals In fact none of these firsts is first as scraps of felt have survived since the Neolithic era 9 000 years ago making it the oldest form on cloth One theory postulates that felt was discovered 'm any times and in many parts of the world because its popularity has risen when societies have become poor cold and agrarian As each society became more urban and advanced felt making subsided or disappeared To the hat industry whoever invented felt is not as important as the fact that felt hats function well Hats made of felt are durable comfortable and attractive Felting has evolved to an art in hat making Each manufacturer closely guards his exact felt making process and formula I ve come to understand over the years that what constitutes a good felt hat can be a matter of opinion or taste For example the stiff and meaty felt associated with a high quality American western hat is much different than the supple and light fine felt material associated with European hat making (T hink Stetson versus Borsalino ) Both felts require quality pelts and skilled craftsmanship but with much different objectives Not only do the materials ( wool hare beaver nutria etc ) used to make felt vary but a host of considerations inform the outcome Some hats are made to be protective and therefore the felt is stiff and heavy The bowler in fact was made for a game warden in 1850 who wanted protection while chasing poachers on horseback Cowboy hats function similarly On the other hand dress hats-which do keep one 's head warm or dry-are typically lighter weight and in great part expressions of style and taste The finish of the felt as distinct from its materials can be 's ilk or angora or beaver ( not necessarily meaning that the hat contains beaver fur ) or velour or 's uede or 's ponge or 's cratch Each finish has its own expression and associations For example the silk or angora finishes are typically associated with aristocrats and the top hat or homburg style Know that the felt hat that you are wearing or about to purchase is extremely labor intensive and is a modern day example of an ancient and venerable craft 
Outfitted with burly outsoles waterproof materials and big toe guards trail shoes are built to bring you closer to nature As the following reviews indicate not every trail shoe is perfect for every off-road outing Some are built low and feature sticky treads that grip mucky footpaths and shale-strewn climbs Others have smaller treads and thicker cushioning more appropriate for less-rugged terrain To determine how they measure up we analyzed each shoe at the RW Shoe Lab and tested them on the feet of more than 200 runners We found these nine shoes to be the best for tackling the trails WE SAY This is one of the few trail shoes with enough cushioning to handle long stretches of road and still provide sure footing on loose terrain and mud thanks to its deep lugs It also features a grippy edge in the heel that helps maintain traction going downhill RW Shoe Lab tests show the shoe 's heel and forefoot to be among the softest in this guide All this cushioning results in a bulkier-than average midsole that some testers felt lifted them too high off the ground Recommended for trail runners who frequently mix in some roads and don t want to sacrifice off-road traction WEAR-TESTER SAYS I liked the traction but the heel felt high Jenna Druver 32 East Lansing 
Meanwhile the National Geographic Society has been funding Dr Haile-Selassie since 2005 at a new research site called Woranso-Mille in the Afar depression of Ethiopia There his team found 4 million-year-old hominins that may help clarify a transition that occurred after Ardipithecus the transition from Australopithecus anamensis to Lucy 's species Au afarensis With his impressive track record for significant discoveries and research publications there is one thing we can be sure of we have not heard the last from Dr Yohannes Haile-Selassie Today the world will witness the long-awaited roll out of Ardipithecus ramidus And what a roll out This new member of the hominin lineage has features that are quite unexpected because they are unlike what we see in living great apes which share common ancestry with humans A whole issue of Science is devoted to this creature and the work of a dedicated group of scientists who spent many years in the desolate Mi le Awash project area of the Afar depression in Ethiopia I ve had the pleasure of meeting many of the Mi le Awash team members over the years Among them are many Ethiopians who started their careers in the Mi le Awash more than 15 years ago as bright dedicated students Now they are PhDs who are spread throughout the world at prestigious institutions making significant contributions to science not the least of which are the many papers being announced today concerning the anatomy and environment of Ardipithecus ramidus Buried in these scientific papers is a significant mention that may pass right by many readers In the paper entiltled Ardipithecus ramidus and the Paleobiology of Early Hominids the authors mention how in the early 1990s after much looking they were only finding scrappy bits of early human fossils at Aramis They go on to say however that on 5 November 1994 Y H S collected two hominid metacarpal fragments ( ARA-VP-6 /5001 a and b ) from the surface of an exposed silty clay Those hand bones were the first bits found of what would become the substance of much of today 's press announcement the most complete skeleton of an adult early hominin since the discovery of Lucy the australopith in 1974 Who is its discoverer Y H S It was none other than Yohannes Haile-Selassie one of the Ethiopian students I mentioned Meanwhile the National Geographic Society has been funding Dr Haile-Selassie since 2005 at a new research site called Woranso-Mille in the Afar depression of Ethiopia There his team found 4 million-year-old hominins that may help clarify a transition that occurred after Ardipithecus the transition from Australopithecus anamensis to Lucy 's species Au afarensis With his impressive track record for significant discoveries and research publications there is one thing we can be sure of we have not heard the last from Dr Yohannes Haile-Selassie That was 1994 Now Haile-Selassie is well known in the paleoanthropological community for another discovery and report that of Ardipithecus kadabba a hominin that lived over one million years earlier than Ar ramidus He and his colleagues first reported on this species in 2001 and a second report followed in 2004

1973 - Pure expressive massing This house 's interior volumes strain the break free pushing the facade to the limits of thinness Ornament consists of the house 's own volumes and the interplay of glass with a couple of solid facing materials Delightful and it must surely be awash in natural light all day long 1977 - Everything about this house screams 1960s from the vertical wood slats to the mixed-color brick but it evidently came down the pike about ten years later than it looks That front entry facade is pure art 1983 - Again my first guess was late 1960s perhaps a facade tacked on to an older house Well the facade is certainly tacked on but the house is surprisingly new Given the date and the strangely pretentious front elevation one is tempted to call it a PostModern work A split driveway (s urrounding a planted island ) descends to twin single-car garages with stairs leading up to the main entrance Miniature grandeur or a house with its foundations washed out from under it You be the judge 1978 - Another fortress in concrete but this one succeeds beyond all expectations This elegant house raises the primary living spaces raised up above the ground - a strategy used 70 years earlier in Frank Lloyd Wright 's Robie House Thirty years old now but it could just as easily be brand new I must apologize to my readers for the lack of postings lately but you see I ve been busy getting married Getting married ( and its aftermath and the preceding Christmas holidays ) has involved a great deal of travel Without further elaboration have as a momentary filler some photos from my recent adventures in The North Shore from Evanston on up to Winnetka is an unbelievable assemblage of wealth Mansion after mansion lines Sheridan Road as it winds its way up the lake Compared to the urban hustle of Chicago just a few miles south the area is unbelievably sylvan and tranquil The houses are pretty unbelievable and there 's quite a few of architectural interest but for now let 's just enjoy the pretty colors shall we It 's not a dazzling building but its jumble of massing is intriguing Each function of the building seems to have its own articulation even its own facade material And it 's hard to fully judge a Modernist building when the windows are boarded over The funeral home appears to have operated into 2002 before moving to a new location in Skokie Since then it 's been vacant and boarded up with a developer planning ot turn the land into new residential development Given its former use the o 's of this little Midcentury piece surviving are pretty slim As detailed in an article in Chicago Real Estate Daily the economic slowdown is the only reason the building is still standing Doomed along with it is this vacant turn of the century apartment house with retail in the base I 'm sure the would-be developers imagined a massive apartment / condo blockbuster building similar to others that have gone up along other sections of Broadway in recent years But with the scent of the money trail gone cold couldn t some thought be given to finding a new use for this little slice of 1960s style Much of the lot is empty land A small outbuilding is the only structure on the northern half of this large city lot -- plenty of room for new and old to co-exist

By popular request in comment threads and emails I ll be putting together a Saturday digest of election-oriented diaries from now until November This project emerged from the Community Power Election Season diary written Feb 20 Next week I ll introduce you to a couple of other Kossacks who will be joining me in running the project Each digest will include a list of election diaries published during the previous week and categorized by region A separate section will include diaries written in the previous week by incumbents new candidates and wannabe candidates (D iaries by incumbents may or may not be directly related to the coming elections ) Digests will also focus on a few tips for making diaries more persuasive informative and written in a way that encourages everyone to read them even if they live 2000 miles away from the spotlighted contest This week we re talking headlines Just as with a story in a newspaper or magazine a headline can make or break a diary That is you can attract an audience or drive it away by the words and structure you choose Crafting great headlines is something even some of the best writers never quite get the knack of but everybody can train themselves to become better at it Too many writers spend hours on research and writing their diaries then slap on a 30-second headline Spend some time at it A good practice is to write three or four possible headlines and choose the best one Happily for bloggers some of the old rules from the old media like character counts don t apply in wwwLand But some do Here are 10 guidelines to think about Headlines are bait Instill curiosity :\ Paternity Test Demanded for Florida Abstinence Campaigner Voters Eager to Punish Liberals Selves Conversational headlines appeal to the most readers Use the active voice Good verbs work wonders To be conjugations bore readers There 's power in humor but serious stories suffer from overly cute headlines Headlines with a twist of an old cliché reel in readers But take care not to twist too far Beware Double entendres can help or hurt Cops Pinch Lewd Nude works however Clinton Wins Budget More Lies Ahead has problems Be succinct Short headlines are punchier and easier to read Ernest Hemingway told a whole story once in six words - For sale baby shoes never used A helluva good headline too Match the headline to the story Don t deceive Nobody likes being taken for a fool If the diary is about a candidate the candidate 's and / or district 's name should usually appear in the headline DON T WRITE HEADLINES IN ALL CAPS Besides 's houting they are hard to read If it 's not BREAKING don t lie about it From this week 's collection of election diaries I ve picked what I think are four solid headlines But even most of them could be tweaked Human trafficking much of it for sexual purposes is a worldwide phenomenon It can be found everywhere from Vietnam to the United States Estimates of its victims run from 4 million to 27 million which numbers provide a window on how difficult 
By now most of us have heard this story in one fashion or another when Steve Jobs and Apple were in the planning stages of the iPhone the first carrier they brought the device to was America 's largest network Verizon Even if you haven t heard how the tale ends -- Verizon refused and Jobs took his multi-billion dollar ball to AT T -- you surely know the outcome The iPhone has soared to become the ultimate smartphone the must-have accessory that everyone from celebrities to your mom wants -- nay needs -- to have in their pocket It 's changed the landscape of modern cellphones put a serious dent in the sales of competing devices ( just recently overtaking the venerable RAZR as the best-selling domestic handset ) and unquestionably raised the bar when it comes to expectations for features in new handsets It may seem unfair to open up the review of RIM 's latest BlackBerry -- the Storm -- with a history lesson on the iPhone but if you understand the market which Verizon and RIM hope to capture then you understand the Storm and it helps put this critique in perspective The Storm a widescreen touchscreen device boasts many of the same features as the iPhone but a 's innovations like a clickable display and comes packed with RIM 's legendary email and messaging services Mainlined into the biggest ( and some say best ) network in the States the Storm is an almost deafening blast to the competition at first glance but does it hold up on closer inspection Read on to find out 
A few weeks ago a gentleman of by his own account more than average girth was thrown off a Southwest Air flight between Oakland and Burbank Unfortunately for the airline this was no ordinary gentleman but Kevin Smith director of such classics as Clerks and Zack and Miri Make a Porno and perhaps more importantly a man conversant with social media As he was unceremoniously removed from the flight because he was a customer of size and therefore a safety risk he turned to twitter to vent his spleen The resulting fracas was what we in the nerdy world call a twitter storm That is one person is able to leverage the power of social networks to make a much bigger noise than would otherwise be the case Some commentators have suggested this is a new kind of customer a new kind of uglry customer who isn t always right but insists on his right to share his feelings with us and his right to be heard as one Singaporean travel industry insider put it Of course this isn t the case There have always been Kevin Smiths it 's just they have not been able to convey their disquiet so effectively Now they have at their fingertips the ability to express and disseminate their feelings I 'm a Kevin Smith We re all Kevin Smiths We re all capable of knowing when we ve been discriminated against not in this case because of his girth but because he was not told before he got on the plane or when he bought his ticket that he wouldn t be able to fly We re all Kevin Smiths and we ve all got the tools of Kevin Smith Perhaps not the colorful turns of phrase but the means Now I 'm not blaming Southwest here at least at the corporate level Actually they did all the standard things to try to put out this blaze They tried to reach him by email by phone and then publicly by twitter to apologize They blogged about it about their policy and the lessons learned But their failure was to understand that information travels much faster now So in the crucial hours no minutes after Kevin Smith was dumped off the flight there was a chance to turn all this around

Rolling out next-generation wireless networks can be painstakingly slow and patchy at the best of times as the U S deployment of 3G has shown But IBM researchers in China reckon that shifting the signal-processing requirements from base stations into the cloud will make it cheaper and easier to upgrade networks Ultimately the approach could lead to wireless networks that can provide better coverage by rapidly adapting to user demand A new architecture called the Wireless Network Cloud (W NC ) marks a step away from using dedicated hardware in the radio base stations that serve wireless networks like GSM and 3G cell phone networks says Ling Shao senior manager of System Software and Appliances at IBM 's China Research Lab in Beijing With WNC the radio antennas are physically decoupled from the base stations with the latter existing virtually within general-purpose data centers at distant locations All of the signal processing--the modulation and encoding of the signals to and from the physical antennas--is carried out using software radio technology a 's Yonghua Lin manager of IBM 's Next Generation Network Appliance With multicore and multithreading techniques it is possible to use general-purpose data centers to carry out the signal processing entirely in software she says 
Poor Microsoft they must be wondering when it 's all going to end Their browser choice screen was launched on 1 March following costly EU legal shenanigans Statisticians then reported that the random browser display was not as random as it could be Now the makers of Avant Flock GreenBrowser K-meleon Maxthon Sleipnir and Slim have complained to the EU about the visibility of their browsers The vendors state that it 's not immediately obvious there are further browser choices beyond the initial five displayed on the choice screen Microsoft has reiterated that the screen was in built in accordance with the European Commission 's demands In my opinion no vendor will ever be 100 % happy with the screen even if Microsoft succumb to their wishes Offering 12 browsers is slightly ridiculous and few novices will appreciate such an overwhelming choice What 's worse is that several of these applications have been rated as 's hockingly low quality in a recent PC Pro review With the possible exception of Flock and Sleipner many users could abandon their new slow and ugly browser return to IE and never try another alternative That 's not what the EU wanted to achieve At least the top 5 browsers give users a choice of good-quality software which has been tried and tested by millions The alternatives may have good points but they re less popular for a reason and they do not offer the same level of support The horizontal scroll bar may not be good design but it 's a reasonable compromise between offering everything and keeping the screen simple I 'm not convinced it should change Are you 
The Plymouth County district attorney 's office has found that selectmen in Rockland Mass violated the open meeting law in the process of hiring a full-time accountant The Patriot Ledger reports A town accountant search committee also violated the law On Beacon Hill and in municipal buildings across the state government officials are getting the message that e-mail can be a double-edged sword writes State House reporter Dan Ring in The Republican of Springfield The state 's Open Meeting Law requires that meetings of governmental boards and committees be conducted in sessions open to the public with few exceptions which are strictly limited The goal of the law is to eliminate as much of the secrecy around discussions and decisions of public policy by requiring that discussion to be done in a public meeting Amendments to the Open Meeting Law have been made many times since it was first adopted in 1958 most recently last July when Gov Deval Patrick signed the ethics lobbying and campaign finance reform bill that included changes to the Open Meeting Law The changes some of which are substantial are scheduled to go into effect July 1 A former Superior Court judge in the U S Virgin Islands won a 240 000 libel verdict this week against the Virgin Islands Daily News The former judge Leon Kendall was represented in the lawsuit by Howard Cooper the Boston lawyer who in 2005 won a 2 1 million verdict against The Boston Herald for former Massachusetts Superior Court Judge Ernest Murphy 
Simply put that was because throughout the Nineties websites had been straining at a technological leash more sophisticated purposes whether that meant using the web to handle email itself or just more advanced websites were not possible with dial-up What ADSL achieved was to utilise frequencies available within old copper wires that were not required for voice transmissions plugging in 'm icrofilters to each home phone socket meant that that the two channels were effectively split into separate lines catering to data and calls respectively The line is asymmetric because download speeds are greater than upload speeds Although not ideal for every purpose that does make relatively passive consumer browsing much more possible The history of the web 's development has shaped the internet too video conferencing for instance was hailed as the next big thing but simply wouldn t work without higher upload rates And websites have looked as they do usually static because the premium was on how much data would fit down each pipe That history of pre-broadband internet continues to shape many of the websites we have today But as broadband access was rolled slowly out across the country its limitations have become clearer ideally it only runs up to two miles from an exchange although five is possible And as technology has fostered cleverer websites the need for better broadband has led to the so-called digital divide between the haves and the have nots Next week we ll look at the state of the broadband nation 
Expressed briefly making a great wine is rather quite simple You find the right piece of ground you put the right grapes in you tend them well and harvest them at the right time and then you smash them together and nudge the product gently away from its tendency towards vinegar For some people the most important step is finding the right piece of ground and for anyone looking to start a winery it is certainly the first step It 's really important If you get it wrong the rest of the stuff doesn t matter At least that 's the way that winemaker Robert Brittan approached it when he packed his brittan_logo gifbags and closed the chapter of his life that might have been entitled Man Meets Cabernet 25 Years in Napa Brittan first started making wine for the same reason many do to get chicks He was a physics major at Oregon State University and like many in the same situation he couldn t get a date But one day he noticed that the guys across the hall had removed all of their furniture and replaced their couches and chairs with two important items a Harley Davidson motorcycle and a still They d brew a batch of whiskey during the week and on the weekends their room would be crawling with girls Brittan couldn t afford to compete with free everclear and a Harley but the envious and enterprising young man thought he might just do one better by going highbrow he would make wine instead So Brittan got a 2 5 gallon glass demijohn and started fermenting everything he could get his hands on wrapping his electric blanket around the jug to keep the fermentation going And wouldn t you know it the first time he actually managed to make something drinkable he got a date Of course then he had to take it to the next level Thinking that if he made better wine he might get better dates Brittan took a job for a harvest in California 's Central Valley and not only learned a thing or two about how to make real wine but discovered as he puts it an entire lifestyle that I immediately knew I wanted It was 1974 and California wine was at an inflection point in its growth that would forever change the state the country and even the world Some of the legendary winemakers of Napa were still plying their craft and people like Robert Mondavi were busy convincing a generation of Americans to drink wine instead of martinis It was just an exciting time to be in the wine business 's ays Brittan There was the whole science aspect of it that appealed to my monkey mind and then the creative component that felt very artistic and then there was this lifestyle -- a way of living that wasn t about getting rich but was about living really well Brittan enrolled in U C Davis and upon graduating began his career as a winemaker eventually ending up at St Andrew 's winery at the very southern end of the Silverado Trail in Napa When the winery was sold Brittan agreed to stay on for the new owner but his heart wasn t in it Brittan had passing fantasies of heading back north to Oregon But then what was just going to be a casual conversation with Carl Doumani about a new vineyard that he had acquired turned into a job offer and a 16-year stint as the winemaker for Stag 's Leap Winery But after those 16 years Brittan found himself wanting a new challenge and decided that he wanted to try his hand at Pinot Noir a grape that he had flirted briefly with in his career but never fully explored So in 2004 after looking as far afield as France and California 's Central Coast Brittan and his wife Ellen returned to Oregon and fell in love with a windy overgrown knoll in the McMinnville AVA ( American Viticultural Area ) of the Willamette Valley There Brittan found an exposed cold 128 acres with nutrient-poor soils that he thought would be perfect for Pinot Noir An 18-acre vineyard had been planted but only about nine acres was still alive and salvageable Co led nurtured and coaxed those nine acres yielded their first wine in 2006 The grapes are picked when Brittan thinks they re ready He believes in the concept of physiological ripeness but is quick to admit that the phrase has been used to the point of cliché He tastes and when they taste ripe he picks Simple as that The fact that his grapes are lower in sugar when he picks ( compared to most of his neighbors ) he simply chalks up to having found the right piece of ground The grapes are crushed and given a five-day cold soak before fermentation is started After the wines have fermented dry they are racked into French oak barrels of which roughly 35 % are new and aged for approximately 9 months following the completion of a secondary fermentation 
Cardigans are another wardrobe must have And they have had a bit of a comeback lately too not that they ever really went out of style but more and more designers seem to have them in their collections Cardigans are great if you aren t a sport jacket kind of guy or if you are feeling more casual They are perfect for transitional weather like in spring They come in so many styles from slim fitting and modern to more traditional There is nothing like the feel of cashmere And when mixed with cotton it 's equally as soft but much less expensive This cardigan has a modern cut with a few modern touches like the contrast trim and elbow patches This is the type cardigan that both you or your dad could wear It 's just a matter of how you wear it I love the color What a great cardigan to wear with jeans Although it 's a bit of a splurge it 's the kind of piece that you would could wear year round If you are fan of argyle patterns then you may like this cardigan It 's definitely more interesting than your average cardigan This cardigan is definitely versatile and so soft You could wear this with jeans and a tee or with dress pants and a button-down shirt I am a big fan of Banana Republic for bringing us designer looks for less 
Last night the airline which employs a total of 13 500 cabin crew was rescheduling some long-haul and short-haul flights which it had expected to have to cancel over the next two days of the strike organised by Unite The union which has 12 000 BA cabin crew members hit back last night and also claimed a resounding success for its first day of industrial action and it insisted BA 's contingency plans had failed The union said 80 per cent of its members had stood firm and that the airline had only been able to fly a third of its intended flights It said that flight cancellations meant that 85 BA planes were parked inactively at Heathrow and a further 20 aircraft were parked at both Cardiff and Shannon airports Despite persistent rumours that secret talks were under way yesterday in an attempt to break the deadlock both sides insisted that had been no fresh new negotiations and that none were planned The strike the first by BA cabin crew in 13 years went ahead after talks over pay and conditions ended in deadlock on Friday A second wave of industrial action is scheduled for next weekend As the war of words escalated between the two sides yesterday Willie Walsh the chief executive of the airline described the strike as a terrible day for BA However the company insisted :\ We continue to offer the fullest support to our cabin crew who want to work as normal BA predicts that 65 per cent of passengers will still be able to reach their destination during the first three-day strike even though a total of 1 100 flights out of the 1 950 scheduled to operate are expected to be cancelled BA has arranged with more than 60 other airlines to take its customers on their flights during the strike Tony Woodley Unite 's joint leader accused BA of wanting a war with the union and complained that Mr Walsh had tabled a worse offer than the one withdrawn earlier Mr Woodley said that he had been set 'm ission impossible because of the new offer which included a four-year pay deal the union maintained would at best freeze wages until 2014 It can be revealed that some female cabin staff braved the threat of intimidation by union workers to go to work as normal yesterday Some of those who worked had received threatening emails on Friday night one of which read :\ If any of you go into work tomorrow your life won t be worth living A strikebreaker who asked to be known only as Suzy for fear of recriminations admitted she was terrified by the prospect of turning up for work as a volunteer My stomach is churning I don t know what I 'm going to face I just know I am going to be on board that plane reassuring passengers sorting out the seating the food Doing my job she said Usually workers quite rightly fear not doing what the boss asks But we are just as frightened not to do what the union asks Some cabin crew had to pass through picket lines to get to work but there were no reports of violence Tall screens were erected outside the crew report centre at Heathrow to protect volunteer staff from intimidation On the picket lines along the airport 's Perimeter Road yesterday union members shouted 's hame on you shame on you at staff buses carrying those cabin crews who had decided to defy the strikes Some of the strikebreakers hid their identity by crouching on the floor of the buses taking them in There was little chaos at the major airports because most passengers had learnt in advance by email text or telephone that their flights were cancelled and that they should not turn up Those who did were relatively relaxed Bryan Collins 21 a student hoping to fly from Heathrow 's Terminal 5 said :\ I checked this morning and they said 60 per cent of customers would be flying today so I guess we should be OK According to an opinion poll carried out in the days before the walkout only one in four supports the action A survey by ICM for BBC Radio 4 's Broadcasting House programme found 60 per cent believed the industrial action was unjustified with 25 per cent expressing support The research also found that more than a third (36 per cent ) believed it was unacceptable in today 's society for workers to have the right to walk out at all This newspaper has learnt that Unite plotted with foreign unions to target BA before its members had even voted for industrial action Union leaders briefed their overseas counterparts as early as November urging them to lend support to its plans to ground BA flights Len McCluskey Unite 's assistant general secretary told hundreds of strikers at a rally near Heathrow yesterday that intransigent management could be defeated Decent men and women are terrified about speaking out about this fight for their futures for fear of reprisals he said There was political in-fighting yesterday over the strike The Prime Minister has urged the two sides to resolve the dispute but David Cameron the Conservative Party leader yesterday accused Gordon Brown of failing to act because Unite is bankrolling the Labour Party Mr Cameron said the strike threatened the very future of one of the UK 's greatest companies A ressing supporters in Putney south-west London he said :\ This threatens the future of one of Britain 's greatest companies along with thousands of jobs The Tories sent a mobile advertising truck to the area around the airport carrying a poster portraying the Prime Minister in an airline uniform with Unite logos and the slogan :\ Gordon 's doing sweet BA is it because he 's taken 11m of Unite 's cash 
TV 's master chef Jacques Pépin has gone from La Technique to le fast food By Bruce Cole Published February 2005 7x7 Magazine / Hartle Media All rights reserved If when cleaning a leek or dismembering a chicken you hear a distinctive French-accented voice in your head telling you precisely what to do next don t be alarmed It 's just Jacques Pépin-or rather one of his many tips you ve absorbed from years of watching him on TV-floating to the surface Starting in 1991 with Today 's Gourmet he 's hosted 11 series for KQED his latest Fast Food My Way premiered in October 2004 But the 69-year-old Pépin is also quite the Renaissance man ( with an MA in French lit from Columbia University no less ) who despite his Gallic upbringing and heritage has an astute take on today 's American culture-as we found out when we spoke to him by phone from his home in Connecticut Foie gras has been in the news especially here in California where a law was just passed to ban eventually its production What do you think of all the hoopla It 's a tempest in a teacup you know Most of the people against foie gras have never even been on a farm If it was traumatizing in any way it would do a lot of damage to the animal and to the liver which would make in inedible If you want to talk about torturing animas go see the way they raise chickens They blind them and cut off their beaks so they can t fight The noise in a factory chicken farm is atrocious-this is why eggs have such a high level of cholesterol They found out years ago that putting acoustic tiles in the room to lower the noise cut the cholesterol level by 10 to 15 percent You ve been a proponent of sustainable cuisine-have you ever considered doing a cookbook or a TV show that features sustainable methods of raising food No because for me that is just part of the equation I use organic food when I can but I 'm not going to stop eating when there isn t any I would have an argument with Alice [W aters because if an ingredient is not organic she doesn t want it Me I ll take a tomato if it 's an extraordinary tomato even if it 's not organic over an organic tomato that has no taste whatever People think that because [s omething 's organic it 's extraordinary I ve had lousy organic food For years you ve taught at the French Culinary Institute in New York and at Boston University Are students these days more concerned with fame and fortune than with just learning the basics Oh yes-probably one out of two are at school because they want to be a celebrity chef They will come in for an interview and say Well I d like to do a book like you and a television show like you so who do you think I should call like there is some secret number It still gives me a shot in the arm though to work with students 
An interesting juxtaposition of articles in the Arts section of the Times this morning Emory has made some of Salmen Rushdie 's papers available including the original Mac machines on which he wrote and there is an interesting discussion of the difficulties of preserving born digital 'm aterials Like most archives our own Archives Special Collections has not begun to tackle this yet too expensive not enough standards etc The second article concerns C-Span placing their video archive on the web You can find the archive here This is not about preservation but all about access and what incredible access This is going straight on my politics libguide But C-Span is actually archived at the Research Park at Purdue Barbara Fister of Gustavus Adolphus has written her usual thoughtful comments about the latest controversy concerning how we can use and sustain large shared bibliographic databases My major concern here is how we can enable the maximum sharing and reuse of data while enabling such organizations as OCLC just enough control so that they have an incentive to continue to do the great work that we have seen over the last forty years Unfortunately when I look for my daily commute it takes me through a gated reserve that would be lovely but illegal The real route slightly shorter and goes along Mizell and east not west of Lake Mizell But Google Maps won t let me change it because I take a pathway not a road for a 20 feet of the route and I bike aacross campus not around it C est la vie Well this is sad news The best local independent bookstore is closing I suppose this is a sign of the times but is a bad sign all the same I enjoyed riding my bike down the Cady Way Trail around the mall and through Thorton Park to the bookstore I guess I just didn t do it often enough Last time I went in February I bought Fernando Baez 's A Universal History of the Destruction of the Book From Ancient Sumer to Modern Iraq But since then I have bought at least two books ( new and used ) on Amazon Pogo was right we have met the enemy and they is us 
Until now most of the art to come out of September 11 has been targeted to adults A lot of it has tried to give us closure to explain what happened to us because of the attacks A reoccurring theme from Jonathan Safran Foer 's Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close to Don DeLillo 's Falling Man is the difficult road to healing If there 's a literary equivalent to Remember Me it 's Claire Messud 's 2006 novel The Emperor 's Children another story about how young spoiled 20-somethings are affected by the su enness of September 11 which ends the novel But in that case the introduction of September 11 felt over the top like an escape from resolution rather than a natural ending point It just didn t feel real That 's not the case with Remember Me which makes us grieve all over again It shows us that no matter how horrible that day was it should never be erased In the immediate aftermath it was wiped from the skyline of Spider-Manand the coffee talk on Friends Now we have the biggest star in the tween world building a memorial dedicated to September 11 When it 's taught in classrooms September 11 is presented as a historical atrocity The key word historical For those who weren t old enough to pick up The New York Times in the days that followed ( like the screenplay writer of the movie who found his inspiration in the paper 's mini-obituaries of the victims of that day ) the faces of the men and women who perished are simply relics from the past Remember Me exposes a new generation to what happened in American nearly can you believe it a decade ago The title isn t a request It 's a command 
As an English major I 'm a big believer in the idea that great books require a reader 's participation A book isn t finished until the corners are dog-eared the margins are crammed with notes and all the juicy quotes get underlined When it comes to textbooks in particular the ability to annotate text is downright necessary If e-books are the future of literature e-book readers need to become just as capable of annotation and markup as their paper-printed ancestors At least that 's the driving philosophy behind the Entourage Edge a combination e-book reader and tablet computer that is leading the charge toward making e-book text as easy to mark quote and dog-ear as the real thing Unfortunately though the concept is lofty the device has a ways to go before the Kindle and Nook crowd will take notice Design As a first-generation product from a new company the Edge is a surprisingly sturdy and feature-packed device It 's also an awkward sprawling mess Blame it on the times we live in but so far no one has been able to invent a unified touch-screen technology that combines the readability and low power consumption of electronic ink displays ( used on products such as the Amazon Kindle and Sony Reader ) with the vibrant colored illuminated LCD screens necessary for even modest Web browsing or media playback Unwilling to compromise between a quality reading experience and a quality Web and media experience the Entourage Edge literally links together a 9 7-inch e-ink display ( a Wacom touch screen ) and a 10 1-inch color LCD ( resistive touch screen ) and assigns each screen the tasks to which they are best suited 
It is Christmas Day 2009 This is the first Christmas that I have not had any contact with my parents As some of you know my dad died last year in September but I still had contact with my mom This past September my siblings felt that it was in Mom 's best interest to move her into an assisted living facility I know that her memory was not the best but I am not sure if it is only the short term memory At this point my only point of contact is with my brother and he has only written to me once in the thirteen years I have been in prison and that letter came in October of this year telling me that he had moved mom into the assisted living facility and was only writing to me because Mom told him to He did not tell me the a ress of where our mother is saying that he would bring any letters and cards I sent to her when he went to visit her I sent out a letter to him including one to Mom on November 1 and since then I have not heard anything This is one of the most vexing problems for a lot of people in prison contact with family members There is often a lot of tension bad feelings and emotional confusion when a member of the family ends up in prison Sometimes it is seen as a badge of honor Sometimes there is a sense of gratitude that an out of control family member is getting the help he or she needs At the recent Residents Encounter Christ weekend we heard from one mother whose son was suffering from drug a iction Since being incarcerated he has turned his whole life around taking every program he can get into including college classes His mom told us with tears in her eyes she is so grateful to have her son back Even though he is still incarcerated That is one of the rarer success stories It is not always the case where parents and other family members are willing ( or able ) to provide the very much needed emotional support for an incarcerated family member While it is true that all our needs are supposed to be supplied by our keepers reality presents a much different picture Up until this past September I have been blessed with parents that have supported me both financially and emotionally throughout my journey as an incarcerated person It is really up to family and friends to provide the emotional and other support that an individual needs Yes we are all provided three hots and a cot But there is no way any system can provide all an individual needs That is exactly the problem Individual needs The very words individual needs would be tough to put into the same sentence with the word system It is my opinion backed by thirteen plus years on the inside that one of the most common holes in an inmate 's life is having his or her individual needs met A lot of the time the problem is compounded by an inmate not even knowing what his needs are I suppose a definition of the word need is in order 
Not long after Amazon updated the U S -only version of the Kindle and replaced it with a new international Kindle model the company followed suit with the larger Kindle DX This new model--now called the Kindle DX ( Global Wireless )\ --runs on AT T 's network and can access content on cellular networks inside and outside of the U S Aside from the switch in wireless carriers ( the old DX used to be powered by Sprint and didn t work outside the U S ) nothing else has visibly changed--at least as far as the hardware itself goes The 0 38-inch-deep DX is just a tad thicker than the 0 36-inch Kindle And the Kindle DX 's 9 7-inch e-ink display (1 200-by-824-pixel resolution ) technically offers 2 5 times more screen real estate than the Kindle 's 6-inch display That extra screen comes at a price both figuratively and literally as the DX weighs almost twice as much (18 9 ounces ) as the Kindle and costs 230 more at 489 Aside from the price the biggest strike against the DX is a competing product from Apple In early 2010 Apple announced that it would release the iPad which offers a full-color capacitive touch screen that 's the same size as the Kindle 's monochrome e-ink screen along with a far richer feature set including much better support for PDF and image files ( the iPad also supports video playback Web browsing and iPhone apps ) 
Did you ever want to resize a video on the fly scaling it as you would an image Using intrinsic ratios for video you can This technique allows browsers to determine video dimensions based on the width of their containing block With intrinsic dimensions a new width triggers a new height calculation allowing videos to resize and giving them the ability to scale the same way images do See example one The concept The idea is to create a box with the proper ratio (4 3 16 9 etc ) then make the video inside that box stretch to fit the dimensions of the box It 's that simple The trick The pa ing property is the magic that styles a box with an intrinsic ratio This is because we ll set pa ing in a percentage based on the width of the containing block The CSS rules below illustrate how to style the parent and child to create a 'm agic wrapper a container that proportionally resizes itself depending on the width of its parent See example two Let 's review the declarations in each rule starting with wrapper-with-intrinsic-ratio position relative By declaring position relative all child elements will position themselves in relation to this container pa ing-bottom 20 % This declaration gives the box a specific format Using 20 % for pa ing makes the height of the box equal to 20 % of its width We specifically chose to use pa ing-bottom rather than pa ing-top This is because IE5 removes the 's pace created via pa ing-top from the flow In other words using pa ing-top 20 % would create the layout we want but the box would act like an absolutely positioned element overlapping the next elements in the flow height 0 Specifying a height of 0 gives this element layout so that IE5 and IE6 will dimension the inner box properly To learn more visit On having layout Note because IE5 and IE6 treat width as a minimum width you should not use width 100 % as a layout trigger This causes the box to expand to fill its container rather than respect the width we set for that container Now let 's consider each declaration within our element-to-stretch rule Let 's take a closer look at our new selectors and declarations starting with the containingBlock selector width 50 % This is just a wrapper to demonstrate resizing the video based on the viewport width In the previous example the containing block was the body element Now let 's examine a couple of the declarations under the videoWrapper selector pa ing-bottom 56 25 % To create a 16 9 ratio we must divide 9 by 16 (0 5625 or 56 25 %) pa ing-top 25px To avoid issues with the broken box model ( IE5 or IE6 in quirks mode ) we use pa ing-top rather than height to create room for the chrome Finally we use the object embed selector because while some browsers rely on object ( e g Safari ) others need embed ( e g Firefox ) Note I 'm using YouTube 's markup for now but at the end of this article I ll be using valid markup and dropping embed 
Designing a graphic is like writing a story You can t include all your material nor can you present it with uniform emphasis To engage readers you have to selectively edit and then order your information into a narrative In other words what is most important for people to see and in what order Not every reader will agree with our choices Our health care graphic from the January issue ( left click to enlarge ) has provoked a healthy debate around the blogosphere Some people love it others loathe it The issue isn t just premiums or public options Many bloggers are talking about our process There 's nothing wrong with a scatter-plot solution It just emphasizes different points a different story Here 's why I didn t go this route 1 ) Many people have difficulty reading scatter plots When we produce graphics for our magazine we consider a wide audience many of whose members are not versed in visualization techniques For most people it 's considerably easier to understand an upward or downward line than relative spatial positioning 2 ) This graphic was designed for our vertical printed page ( top ) Scatter plots tend to work better as horizontals Without this context I can see why online viewers would question the graphic 's shape 3 ) Any data visualization is going to put certain information in the foreground and other info in the background The scatter plot nicely organizes the countries into three clusters but the varying dot size puts too much emphasis on the doctor-visit data which should be a tertiary point On the other hand our parallel plot ( which I anchored around the spending and life-expectancy averages ) calls the reader 's attention to discrepancies between spending and life expectancy the story I wanted to tell I applaud people for questioning our approach in fact I love this kind of dialogue especially about art and design Whether we reach consensus well that 's a different story At least one blogger said we should have used a graph known as a scatter plot A scatter plot lets you visualize the relationship between multiple variables In the case of the health care graphic our variables are spending life expectancy and doctor visits The scatter-plot version ( below ) plots spending along the x axis and life expectancy along the y and it uses dot size to show the doctor visits There 's nothing wrong with a scatter-plot solution It just emphasizes different points a different story Here 's why I didn t go this route 1 ) Many people have difficulty reading scatter plots When we produce graphics for our magazine we consider a wide audience many of whose members are not versed in visualization techniques For most people it 's considerably easier to understand an upward or downward line than relative spatial positioning 2 ) This graphic was designed for our vertical printed page ( top ) Scatter plots tend to work better as horizontals Without this context I can see why online viewers would question the graphic 's shape I can see why online viewers would question the graphic 's shape I can see why online viewers would question the graphic 's shape 
The musicians haven t left yet but they do their shows in El Paso now 's ays Alfonso Quiñones a Juárez concert promoter who is trying to organize a jazz festival in the city No solid number exists for the exodus a matter of debate among Juárez 's leaders But the city 's planning department estimates 116 000 homes are now abandoned Measured against the average household size of the last census the population who inhabited the empty homes alone could be as high as 400 000 people representing one-third of the city before the violence began That would mark one of Mexico 's largest single exoduses in decades The problem is that we don t have the rule of law here 's ays Lucinda Vargas an economist who runs a civic group called Plan Estratégico de Juárez Juárez finds itself in the crossfire between two rival drug gangs the local Juárez cartel and the powerful Sinaloa cartel both of whom want to control the city to smuggle drugs into the U S the world 's biggest drug-consuming market and capture a lucrative and growing local drug market In 2008 roughly 1 600 people were killed here up from a few hundred annually in previous years President Felipe Calderón decided to send federal police and some 7 000 troops to quell the dispute The move hasn t worked Last year the death toll reached 2 600 people making it Mexico 's most violent city There have been an estimated 500 homicides this year The latest high-profile blow to the city came on March 13 when three people associated with the U S Consulate in Juárez were gunned down in an incident that drew outrage from presidents on both side of the border Juárez isn t alone in its troubles with drug gangs which operate with near complete impunity in much of northern and western Mexico On Friday residents of Mexico 's northern business capital Monterrey awoke to nightmarish traffic after heavily armed men believed to be linked to drug gangs commandeered several trucks and buses and used them to block eight strategic traffic points around the city 
The Daily Examiner has served up a tasty slice of the local snarkosphere ever since A J Daulerio started blogging for the Philadelphia Magazine site one year ago It was smart smart-assed and featured more than anything good reporting and writing as he developed into a wise guide to what people were typing in these parts He came from Deadspin He returns to Deadspin Which is good because his bio could not accomodate the names of any more publications Maxim Gawker Knot the Black Table Huffington Post Deadspin O jack Deadspin ( he likes Deadspin ) Today 's his last day He gets to continue to live in his parent 's gargage Someone trawling Philly com for bias at 9 50 this morning might have jumped to the wrong conclusion seeing the promotional space for blogs The big damned fish we re talking about wasn t Bill Clinton It referred to the picture that had been there of a giant striped bass plucked from the Schuylkill Maybe it 's that the pictures and the display copy update at slightly different paces on the home page so this was just a momentary thing We love Bill around here you know This was nothing like Mush From The Wimp

With a surprising win in Saturday 's 1 500 meters speedskater Jonathan Kuck of Champaign moved into the overall lead after three of the four races at the World All-Around Championships in Heerenveen the Netherlands Kuck 20 a University of Illinois junior is unlikely to hold that lead over reigning all-around champion Sven Kramer of the Netherlands after the final race Sunday 's 10 000 meters in which Kuck finished 8th at the 2010 Olympics But given his strong performance in Friday 's 5 000 where Kuck finished fourth to the victorious Kramer he should have a good chance at a medal Kuck who won a silver medal in team pursuit at the Olympics recorded a personal best time of 1 minute 45 36 seconds in the 1 500 
With the release of a trove of candid and even cringe-worthy emails and documents Viacom on Thursday claimed that YouTube knew full well that much of its content violated copyright but instead turned the other way seeking to boost traffic on its site and the value of its company But in defending itself in Viacom 's 1 billion federal copyright infringement suit YouTube countered that Viacom sought to benefit from the user-upload site 's promotional value posting its own clips on the site even as it complained of pirated material And in some cases YouTube says Viacom 's marketers secretly deployed third parties to post videos from Paramount and other subsidiaries in an effort to make it look as if its content was gaining grassroots popularity Moreover YouTube points to documents that showed that Viacom wanted to buy YouTube or to enter into a content partnership only to file suit when no agreement was struck Google bought the company for almost 1 8 billion in 2006 Undoubtedly both sides would have preferred to keep some of this material private However when both sides filed for summary judgment U S District Judge Louis Stanton ordered that the documents had to be released as they would be cited in the filings Viacom 's suit filed in 2007 in a New York federal court highlights the extent to which just a few years ago old media grappled with how to embrace new media and at the same time ensure that its content could be protected The heat on YouTube however has diminished in recent years as the site has deployed more sophisticated technology to identify copyright abuses In seeking damages from YouTube Viacom is attempting to show how its founders almost from it start in 2005 recognized the potential liability for posting pirated content yet largely disregarded those concerns knowing that the site depended on premium videos -- as opposed to the homegrown content featuring favorite pets or curious stunts -- for traffic In a March 5 motion for partial summary judgment Viacom said the YouTube founders saw that its success hinged on building a business based on piracy and that they cast a blind eye to and did not block the huge number of unauthorized copyrighted works posted on the site Moreover they say Google was aware of the perils of featuring pirated content on its own video site before it bought YouTube but abandoned its scruples in order to continue growing the YouTube user base until well into 2008 It also said YouTube had its own fingerprinting and filtering technologies to block pirated works but engaged in a form of high tech extortion by refusing to apply the technology to protect Viacom content unless Viacom first agreed to license its clips to the site If you were not willing to give them your content for nothing they were going to keep stealing Michael Fricklas Viacom 's executive vice president and general counsel told Daily Variety on Thursday Viacom points to a wealth of emails it says shows that YouTube 's founders were aware of the knowledge of and intent to benefit from massive copyright infringement on YouTube In a July 29 2005 email about competing video websites YouTube co-founder Steve Chen wrote to co-founders Chad Hurley and Jawed Karim 's teal it Hurley responded :\ hmm steal the movies Chen replied :\ we have to keep in mind that we need to attract traffic how much traffic will we get from personal videos remember the only reason why our traffic surged was due to a video of this type viral videos will tend to be THOSE type of videos 
Let us hope Donnie Walsh 's free-agent signing this summer works out better than the one he made in December with Jonathan Bender Bender 's season is over as he will have surgery Monday on his broken ring finger he injured Friday vs Philly Bender 's career may be over at least with the Knicks who are not expected to bring him back next season The 6-11 Bender played in 25 games and averaged 4 6 points He had an excellent start playing with panache his first three games before petering out Bender was only playing Friday in place of injured David Lee and Wilson Chandler In the end it wasn t worth the expenditure or the fact it teed off E y Curry who was benched after three games to make way for Bender -- MSG P R man Sammy Steinlight leaves the Garden in a week ( check out tomorrow 's Rumble for more on his future ) Steinlight will be sorely missed The best tip Sammy ever gave me was not Knicks-related A diehard Springsteen fan he called one afternoon a few years back and said he 's hearing from sources Springsteen was going to make a surprise appearance that night at the Stone Pony in Asbury Park A Springsteen band member Suzie Tyrell was the headliner and Bruce Sammy claimed planned to take the stage for a few songs My friends and I skeptically piled into a car and made the long drive from Long Island Sammy 's rep was on the line as there 's always frequent false rumors of Bruce at the Stone Pony Bruce indeed showed that night and Sammy became a legend among my friends 
Are you a film buff who can t seem to find a way to put your excessive knowledge of movies to good use Do you think :\ Gosh if I knew as much about stocks as I do about Hollywood I d be rich Well your time may have finally come Investment firm Cantor Fitzgerald will be starting an online service in April that will allow users to bet on the success ( or failure ) of movies Anyone could use the service -- not only the film industry Though unlike NYU film school students studios would have an actual legitimate business reason for using the exchange they can hedge their investments in movies So even though this idea might seem sort of silly to the serious stock investor it 's no more ridiculous than Exxon using oil futures to hedge energy prices And you don t only have to go long on a film you can also short movies that you think will flop For example if they ever decide to put Dane Cook in a movie again you can bet that it ll be a stinker I know I would This does raise an interesting question about insider trading For example if Brad Pitt just made a movie that he now realizes was a big mistake because it 's absolutely horrendous can he bet against it He clearly has nonpublic information What if he tells his friend George Clooney how bad it is and Clooney shorts the film Or what if I was lucky enough to see an advanced screening to come to the same conclusion That 's a little bit like hearing a company 's earnings before release I d hope the SEC has given these considerations some thought before approving the new exchange Betting on films could happen before in just-for-fun exchanges and probably for real money in Vegas But I ll be curious to see how a real exchange does -- and who uses it more Even though it would only have legitimate appeal to studios if my movie-loving friends passion for film is any indication the exchange could be wildly popular Anyone could use the service -- not only the film industry Though unlike NYU film school students studios would have an actual legitimate business reason for using the exchange they can hedge their investments in movies So even though this idea might seem sort of silly to the serious stock investor it 's no more ridiculous than Exxon using oil futures to hedge energy prices 
Pope Benedict has apologised to the victims and survivors of clerical abuse in Ireland and expressed his disappointment at the failure of Irish bishops to deal appropriately with abuse allegations In his long-awaited Pastoral Letter he writes :\ I can only share in the dismay and the sense of betrayal that so many of you have experienced on learning of these sinful and criminal acts and the way Church authorities in Ireland dealt with them The picture shows Cardinal Sean Brady handing out copies of the Letter at Saint Patrick 's Cathedral today The cardinal began his speech of welcome for the Letter with these words :\ My dear people of the Cathedral Parish of Armagh today is a very historic day for the Catholics of Ireland Pope Benedict has written a pastoral letter to express his closeness to us at this challenging time In expressing his closeness the Pope also told the Cardinal and his episcopal colleagues that their credibility and effectiveness have been 's eriously undermined by their failure to act appropriately to protect children from abuse The Pastoral Letter is historic for a number of reasons not least because it is the first official papal document dealing with the clerical abuse crisis facing the Catholic Church for 25 years The Letter as predicted does not explore issues of organisational reform within the church in ireland but the Pope announces that he plans to send Apostolic Visitors to certain dioceses religious orders and seminaries in Ireland That may be an indication of further proposals for re-organising the church or dealing with systemic issues that permitted abuse to continue unchecked for so long Pope Benedict also calls on the Irish church to re-embrace the disciplines of Catholic spirituality that section of the Letter may prove controversial because it is clear that the Pope believes that the loss of those disciplines alongside the rise of certain kinds of modernist ideas and practices within the western church helped to create the conditions in which the abuse crisis was born (s ee paragraph 4 ) 
When job-seeking illustrator Laura Levy first met the team of Wall Street Journal hedcut artists in the early 1980s she was struck by their peculiar task I saw what these people were doing and I thought they re insane 's ays Levy They re sitting there all day long drawing one tiny little drawing with pen and ink But it turns out I must be nuts because it 's fantastic 's ays the now veteran staff artist For a newspaper that for more than a century celebrated the lack of images within its pages it is surprising to note that the Journal 's signature mark is the dot-ink portrait In explanation of that visually-averse legacy former executive editor Fred Taylor famously sai dI ve always thought that one word was worth a thousand pictures But while the paper 's world-class reporting has propelled the Journal brand it 's the stipple drawing pioneered by Journal artists 30 years ago that has become a trademark It 's an icon 's ays staff artist Nancy Januzzi of the miniature portraits It really is the look of The Wall Street Journal Since 1979 the drawings or hedcuts have become much more than the currency and certificate engravings they were modeled on So many likenesses of prominent figures have been featured that to have one 's hedcut appear in the Journal is for most a seminal moment It sort of became a status symbol 's ays staff artist Hai Knafo 
Peter Sellers is back at work again Perhaps nostalgia is in order Until a few years ago Sellers was the funniest comedian in the movies He turned out a series of splendid British comedies ( now inhabiting the late show ) and even after he got to Hollywood he stayed funny The Pink Panther was good and Dr Strangelove was great and What 's New Pussycat had its moments But then alas Sellers started believing the back-slappers and they told him he was naturally funny He isn t He has his moments but most of the time he has to work like any other comedian There have been a few naturally funny comedians like W C Fields and all they have to do is stand there ( or weave back and forth ) and you laugh But the mortals have to work So anyway Sellers started getting lazy You could almost predict a new Sellers movie It would have Sellers arching his eyebrows and muttering under his breath Sellers delicately not touching a luscious starlet Sellers rolling his eyes Sellers doing his Napoleon imitation The low point in his self-indulgence came in Casino Royale a film unjustly neglected in the lists of last year 's worst All of this is one reason why The Party is so enjoyable Sellers works He develops a character and plays it for better or worse for the whole movie No costume changes No Napoleon suits Sellers is Hrundi V Bakshi a painfully polite actor from India who courteously and delicately sabotages the evening of several dozen guests and an elephant He is assisted by a hilariously drunken butler (S teve Franken ) The story has to do with a party in the home of a Hollywood studio chief Director Blake Edwards begins in low key with cocktail music tinkling in the background while everyone nods politely and Sellers shoe floats over the waterfall in the living room The insanity gradually escalates but for the first two-thirds of the movie the events remain painfully close to life Who among us for example has not waited politely outside the bathroom door at a party a glassy smile concealing our agony Edwards directs with economy for most of the way but when the living room fills up with soapsuds and the elephant he can t help lingering over the expensive scene he 's produced This is an occupational weakness of directors who figure since they re spending so much money they ought to get at least 15 minutes of movie out of their grand finale But chaos should be taken in moderation 
Put down your flamingo mallet for a moment sit at your ravenlike writing desk and work out this equation A one Tim Burton plus one mathematician by the name of Charles Lutwidge Dodgson and divide by the magical World of Disney Multiply the result with hallucinatory visual effects stunning design and scene-chomping acting Then a two Alice novels and a dozen or so Wonderland characters before subtracting a bit of the original sense of play and randomness Then a three dimensions divide a loaf by a knife and carry the tea The product Walt Disney Pictures Alice in Wonderland But callooh callay what 's this you say Not familiar with Charles Lutwidge Dodgson flamingo mallets and ravenlike writing desks Well National Geographic is here to help In 1991 the magazine published a story on Dodgson better known by his pseudonym Lewis Carroll The author of our story informed me that her lifelong love for Dodgson 's craft and ability to play with words had motivated her to pitch the piece She retraced the geographic world that inspired the author and his stories viewed the original manuscript at the British Library and met with the gran aughter of the Alice Read Cathy Newman 's story Marvel at Sam Abell 's photographs and the wonderfully illustrated story map of Wonderland by William H Bond Not only will you get an excellent primer for the adventures and characters you ll see in the movie but you ll also learn that in fact twas brillig and the slithy toves did National Geographic in the wabe Whatever that means As for the movie itself if you re anticipating a direct retelling of either Alice 's Adventures in Wonderland or its follow-up Through the Looking-Glass you ll be disappointed ( or pleased ) The familiar characters do populate the film echoes of Dodgson 's words dance ( and occasionally galumph ) through Linda Woolverton 's screenplay and John Tenniel 's illustrations are startlingly realized But it 's not the same old Wonderland Instead you ll find a sincere ( though heavy-handed ) effort to make sense out of a nonsense story and an attempt to create a sort of plot game that 's to be won instead of a game to be played for play s sake I couldn t fully connect with the film 's heart for these reasons ( it all made too much sense ) and my film companion went further to describe it as very well done made-for-TV movie I understood but I should have argued against this as it didn t feature the greatest acting performance in the history of like all time EVER ( Apologies to Anne Hathaway who portrays the White Queen Love you Anne Really ) The director being Tim Burton you re guaranteed nothing less than a fantastic visual poke in the eyeballs And one shouldn t expect any less from a film that 's been given a PG rating due to a smoking caterpillar No really Search the MPAA site and see for yourself Smoking Caterpillar Um YES One ticket please As an a ed bonus check out New York Magazine 's wonderfully trippy photo illustration of Alice in Wonderland 's influence on culture 
Tomorrow the FCC will release a national broadband strategy The plan will set goals for expanding broadband to unserved and under-served areas promote greater speeds and drive consumer demand It will harness this communications technology to urgent national priorities such as jobs education health energy and security In short the plan will lay the groundwork for investing in America 's future Yes the Internet was invented in the United States Yes we once led the world in broadband development But now networks in many countries from Western Europe to East Asia are faster and more advanced than our own Long after we recover from this recession this broadband gap will be a dead weight on American businesses and workers unless we act now As with the space race in the 1960s America needs a national effort by our scientists engineers companies educational institutions and government agencies Just like that great national adventure we need near-term and long-term goals Broadband is an essential input to expanding business education and healthcare opportunities everywhere As soon as possible we need to bring Internet access to every community from rural America to the inner cities But we also need even more ambitious objectives or 's tretch goals that test the limits of our ingenuity When President John F Kennedy summoned the nation to space exploration the immediate goal was to send an astronaut in orbit around the earth But JFK called for putting a man on the moon because he knew that dream would inspire Americans to literally reach for the stars The private sector has a big job to do and needs to carry much of the investment For our part we plan to build and test an ultra-high-speed broadband network in at least one U S community We are excited by the amount of support our proposed testbed has received from local communities and individuals But smart tailored public policies are critical too Let 's install broadband fiber as part of every federally-funded infrastructure project from highways to mass transit And let 's deploy broadband fiber to every library school community health center and public housing facility in the U S I support a national broadband strategy because ubiquitous broadband connectivity can catapult America into the next level of economic competitiveness worker productivity and educational opportunity But as in the past we will make this breakthrough by choice not chance

The puzzlement to me is how this fits with the previous 25 years of his political life -- rather what retrospective light it sheds on that time Bayh has held elective office since he was 30 He became Indiana 's governor at 33 and U S senator at 43 If he really cared about his Indiana constituents and their problems through that time great But if so how can he walk away with this kind of careless disregard about whether in the style of his departure he is smashing up things that had said were important to him If on the other hand these issues and people never really mattered that much and public life had been a kind of popularity contest -- well that may be true of a lot of politicians but they don t like to reveal it quite this bluntly Here 's a constructive suggestion Do you really care about the partisanship that is ruining public life and that as you said has driven you from the Senate Mr Bayh Then why not use the fact that you are still in the U S Senate for most of another year -- a platform 99 999 % of Americans will never occupy -- and apply all the power you can to advance causes you care about What is holding you back Unlike everyone else up for election this year you don t have to worry how this or that bout of truth-telling will look on Election Day Let em bitch You don t need an interest group to endorse you or a civic club to applaud you any more Do you think hyperpartisanship is destroying the Senate Why not call out people -- by name by specific hypocritical move -- when you see them doing what they should be ashamed of I guarantee that the press would eat this up Why not a ten-month public seminar through the rest of this year on who is doing what and how it could be different Do you object to personal holds on nominations Make it an issue You have an idea of some issue where Republicans and Democrats might agree Be specific about it and see what you can do Again if I know anything about the press and the melodrama of public life I know you could turn it to your advantage -- and the public 's Mr Smith style Your father Birch Bayh became a senator even younger He was 34 when he took office and 52 when defeated by Dan Quayle In between -- through three Senate terms 18 years -- he acted as if he was using his office for something rather than just occupying it That is part of the reason he eventually became vulnerable as someone too liberal for his base His punishment was to That was my policy on the few times I improbably saw a Sam Adams or Rogue Dead Guy beer in a mainland Chinese store All of this was defense against the bleakness of the local offerings 
I recently made a cameo appearance in a three-part BBC documentary about tweed I was wheeled in to give a bit of historical context and to enthuse on the subject The documentary dealt specifically with Harris tweed a unique hirsute cloth made in Scotland 's Outer Hebrides Islands Its pretext was the changes being wrought in what is quite literally a cottage industry with individual weavers working in their homes or garden sheds to make a cloth that is then returned to the mill where it is finished and shipped all over the world Its character owes much to an image thick with peat smoke and Gaelic gently tinted by a thousand hues of lichen dye But even the most ardent tweed enthusiasts among whom I count myself will admit the industry has been declining since a peak of production in the late 1960s of about 7 million yards per year It was with a view toward reviving the industry that a couple of years ago a Yorkshire textiles magnate called Brian Haggas bought the largest mill and set out to relaunch Harris tweed by making thousands of tweed jackets in a palette of colors drastically reduced from about 8 000 to four It was a controversial move and the BBC documentarian Ian Denyer joined the story just as Haggas sa led with thousands of unsold tweed jackets had to take drastic action I arrived at a point where Haggas had told the weavers that he was halting production until he had sold some of his jackets 's ays Denyer But it was not all bad news Haggas 's plans gave an unexpected fillip to the business of two other mills in Shawbost and Carloway which stepped in to fill the color vacuum In making the film Denyer a tweedophile himself was struck by the genuine worldwide enthusiasm for the fabric and it would appear that viewers were moved too Since then Haggas has sold some of his jackets and been inspired to make a fifth model aimed at a younger customer which even goes so far as to feature a traditional polychromatic check Denyer thought his series was affectionate so he was surprised at complaints from some who felt that it portrayed the island and its cloth in an overly folkloric way viewing Harris tweed as an almost ethnographical curiosity But it is the ethno-specific character of Harris tweed that might well ensure its survival With its strong innate regionality unique manufacturing process and romantic locus tweed plays into the modern appetite for products that have an authentic character rather than a manufactured brand identity A low-carbon manufacturing process the looms used by the weavers are foot-powered only a 's to the appeal Like many things that have become ineffably British tweed was largely a 19th-century invention After the Jacobite uprising of 1745 the wearing of tartan was banned but the later influx of affluent Victorian landowners lured north of the border by the novels of Sir Walter Scott and the joys of field sports popularized the district checks and estate tweeds that identified those who lived and worked on their acres Hard-wearing breathable and executed in shades matching the landscape tweed was the cloth from which the sportswear of the British Empire was cut 
Wednesday night that Americans still after all these months do not know Democratic presidential candidate Sen Barack Obama Obama needs to explain his past McCain told viewers McCain targeted Bill Ayers who once served on a foundation board with Obama Ayers a leader of the terrorist Weather Underground in the 1970s has said that he took part in the bombings of New York City Police Headquarters in 1970 the Capitol building in 1971 and the Pentagon in 1972 I don t regret setting bombs Ayers said in 2001 I feel we didn t do enough Obama said he d condemned Ayers 's violent past had not involved him in his campaign and wouldn t have him as an advisor in the White House McCain also assailed the liberal group ACORN which has run a voter registration effort which is under investigation in Nevada and other states after some of its organizers turned in fraudulent registrations to election officials One of the greatest frauds in voter history We need to know the full extent of Senator Obama 's relationship with ACORN who is now on the verge of possibly perpetrating one of the greatest frauds in voter history McCain said 
People all over the blogosphere -- OK some people -- have been asking about the mayor 's leadership in the Google Fiber race Where 's the mayor they ask Amanda at Inside Scoop checks in Knight said he supports the idea but has left the issue to council members like Zack Matheny who can speak about it more proficiently that he can I guess that makes sense OK so where 's Zack I think what people are really wondering is who is the city 's voice Why are the elected officials -- whether they are from City Council from the county commissioners or are Rep Howard Coble -- so low-key on this issue particularly when many other cities are hanging it all out there Examples renaming highways after Google renaming cities after Google urging firstborns to be renamed Google Fiber and swimming with sharks for Google It is OK to have fun isn t it We brought home a passel of awards last night from the AP and the N C Press Association Several items worth noting Betsi Robinson won her second statewide editing award Since 2003 Betsi and features editor Susan La have won the editing award five times Lorraine Ahearn won three awards in three different categories Jerry Wolford won the photographer of the year award continuing a darn good year Tim Rickard has won awards in seven of the last 10 contests Most significant to me is that five of the awards were efforts by our entire staff Full results of all papers here Our specific size category here 
Only the brave take on a complete renovation while living in the space but Jay a professional painter and general handy man is wired for these types of projects Their home is made cozy by their choices of plush furniture throw blankets and vignetted nooks and is unified by neutral creams and natural wood The fresh baked cookies and colorful cut roses adorning all rooms pay tribute to their bed breakfast inspired feel Melissa is a graphic designer and likes incorporating typography The DIY triptych in the living room exemplifies this as well as the burlap coffee sack curtains she made using simple black ribbon All flooring other than the back living room ( which is still on their to do list ) has mix-matched original hardwood floors and no two rooms are the same There are polyurethane boards in some rooms while others are left sanded and dull making a quilt-like pattern in the space complimenting their aesthetic In their kitchen they removed an L-shaped corner counter top and a ed a center island from IKEA In order to integrate the modern island into the space they covered it with bead board and a ed a matching laminate counter top They made the island big enough to fit up to 8 people and use this intimate setting for dinner guests rather than a formal dining room Now that the work is nearly completed they are looking for another fixer-upper two family and hope to have at it once again 
I recently organized an exhibition of photographs by Edward Burtynsky bringing together 12 years of his imagery on the subject of oil at the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington D C Burtynsky a Canadian born of Ukrainian heritage in 1955 is respected internationally for his 25-year focus on industrially-transformed landscapes His photographs of quarries factories mining pits and railcuts are extraordinary for their depiction of mankind 's organization of the land for resource-extraction and profit Jennifer Baichwal 's 2006 documentary Manufactured Landscapes is an excellent portrait of Burtynsky and I highly recommend a viewing of both the DVD and his great books which include Manufactured Landscapes (2003) Burtynsky China (2005) and Edward Burtynsky Quarries (2006) In organizing the exhibition it occurred to me that Burtynsky is one of our most Ballardian artists His intense concentration on the technological sublime the precisionist geometries of his images and his evocation of a rationalist ( yet mysterious ) automatism at the heart of the relationship between man and nature all seem absolutely the inheritance of Ballard 's insightful understanding of our times In writing an essay for the book that accompanies the Corcoran exhibition I adopted a style in overt homage to Ballard in hopes that such a literary strategy might help illuminate this great body of work I also wanted to honor Ballard 's legacy as the foremost imaginative interpreter of the world Burtynsky documents The editors of Ballardian com have graciously agreed to reprint the essay here as an extension of that homage Readers of this site will recognize the tropes the ideas and the specific sources I ve drawn from Ballard 's oeuvre I hope they will forgive any lapses or excesses as my own error The subject is not oil In these pictures Edward Burtynsky shows the man-made world the human ecosystem that has risen up around the production use and dwindling availability of our paramount energy source The mechanics and industry of extraction and refinement the development products and activities associated with transportation and motor culture and the wreckage obsolescence and human cost that lies at the End of Oil These photographs are about man and what he has made of the earth Burtynsky starts at the center of the subject at oil 's source then moves outward around the world showing its use By their arrangement the photographs survey a life cycle Each black drop follows a path following the pictorial sequence we can imagine ourselves trailing in its wake The journey is an unusual one We have rarely seen images of these places Some we didn t know existed others we never thought we d see Has any artist ever documented this manifold subject in such depth This is a new form of epic history painting Turning his camera lens to a fever dream Burtynsky forges a new mythology for the 21st century from the lexicon of realism With stunning detail from improbable perches in strange and beautiful colors these pictures show their subjects with clinical accuracy and with definitive force But they also tell a parallel and more inchoate tale a critique of civilization and a foretelling of human ends Some visual experiences test our capacity for explanation our ability to extract meaning or convey affect through existing vocabulary 
The International Skating Union has decided to allow Olympic bronze medalist Joannie Rochette of Canada to perform an exhibition tribute to her late mother at an unsanctioned competition Thursday in Connecticut That decision comes in the wake of criticism that included a blog entry I wrote Sunday taking the ISU to task over its unwillingness to bend rules given the unusual nature of the situation Michael Slipchuk high performance director of Skate Canada sent a Tuesday email to concerned parties with the ISU 's decision Here is its text from a copy obtained by the Chicago Tribune :\ The ISU has agreed to relax ISU rule 136 for Joannie due to the unique and extenuating circumstances of this particular request and allow her participation in an exhibition number only ( not a competition ) at MGM Grand at Foxwoods USA Therefore Skate Canada has also granted a sanction for her participation in this event 
Buffalo real estate developer Carl Paladino is making it clear that this is going to be a three-way Republican gubernatorial primary with Paladino going up against Republican Rick Lazio and Democrat-turned-Republican Steve Levy But no Republican really has a shot of winning statewide office without the support of--and ballot from--the Conservative Party That group is meeting tomorrow and may make an endorsement The leading candidate to get the Conservative line is Lazio who has the backing of Conservative State Party Chairman Mike Long Republicans leaders are backing Levy but Long doesn t approve of that Paladino 's campaign manager Michael Caputo told me his candidate is the only true fiscal--and social--conservative in the race If Conservatives back Lazio Paladino 's aide said they ll have no choice but to petition to create the Tea Party ballot line Let 's face it if the Conservative Party endorsed Lazio we really don t have a choice he sai dother than to create a Tea Party line Because historically Republican gubernatorial candidates have not been elected without the Conservative Party endorsement But in order to change history we have to form a whole different option 
Ah yes famed technology writer Bruce Emmerling Famed technology writer Bruce Emmerling who can t grammar or spell-check his work and writes with a mastery of his subject akin to that of a 6th grader rushing to complete a paper on a book he hasn t even read Honestly this is what tops Google 's news results in science and technology If that 's the case we should be kinda worried We re quickly moving from citizen journalism ( a dangerous / questionable proposition to begin with ) to bot journalism at least that 's how the above article reads Remember you may be discerning but most people aren t and most people will take a story like this poorly sourced poorly written and digest it as fact Now there 's nothing particularly inaccurate about this piece of news except that it 's written like garbage and essentially cites no sources Plus most media outlets reported on this last week so why is it front page news now And why does the article refer to reviewers when no one has actually used or reviewed the device And who the fuck is Bruce Emmerling Examiner com ( and sites like it hello Associated Content ) should be closely watched by those who care about honest reporting and reliable sources Here is a site that mixes random unknown entries with aggregated ( er scraped ) content from CBS and sites like ours It is a dangerous and dishonest mixture which most people won t catch I know some of you will call foul here Say I 'm being hypocritical Claim Engadget is guilty of all the offenses I 'm griping about But of course you ll be wrong whether you believe it or not Sure we re not a traditional media outlet not the kind the world has known for hundreds of years but we do have a stringent process for both reporting news and choosing the people on staff who write that news It 's not a perfect process nothing is but it 's a process I 'm not sure the same can be said for Examiner Look a shifting perception of media / journalism is one thing but we re starting to dismantle the basic structures in which we test the validity news provide an editorial process and at least pretend to care about some diligence and transparency With arm-chair enthusiasts cranking out a tsunami of edit-free noise like the above story being able to find the real story or dry land will soon seem like a distant memory 
From wind turbines to cell phones rare earth minerals play a big role in advanced technology and they could be key for future clean energy But congress is worried about the fact that almost all of these materials come from China and could be subject to tight export controls by that country 's government The subject was discussed yesterday at a hearing where experts called on the U S government to take steps not only to promote domestic production of these materials but to fund research to find ways to recycle them to use less of them and to do without them altogether The work has already started In one recent example the new Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy recently awarded 4 5 million to develop motors and generators that use magnetics containing low amounts of rare-earth materials The project is ambitious 
I 'm trying to find a balance between sharing my ADHD experience in a blog and putting too much personal information out there in the digital world Yogi Berra the Sage of the Grand Concourse the omphaloskeptic Neapolitan once sai dWhen you come to a fork in the road you should take it I haven t a clue how one would accomplish that but I am at a fork in the road The blame for my erratic blog submissions to A itude can be laid on several doorsteps my innate laziness my inability to manage my time with any dexterity or consistency even mirable dictu my very affliction with The Deficit But issues of privacy and modesty or shame loom larger and larger While I 'm interested in the whole panorama of the ADHD experience I find that doing research on the latest ADHD meds or a controversial diet plan is less attractive than looking inward trying to figure out how the affliction has affected my life how it interacts with my other shortcomings and what if anything I can do about it In a ition I have been told that the postings in which I 'm talking about myself my emotional condition my constant one would like to say Homeric battles with depression and insolvency attract more readers and more comments than anything I might write about the color of the new Concerta formulations ( less for all the relative frivolity than the issue of whether there should be blue M Ms for example ) But there 's a point where I don t want to write about myself Or more accurately want to but feel uncomfortable After all I 'm sure you re all very nice concerned ethical folks I 'm sure the snickering I hear is generated in my own head and not in yours But self-revelation has a price especially in this age where privacy has for all intents and purposes become a rare perhaps non-existent commodity So I ll continue to try to find a balance between my personal situations and my obligations to my ADHD blog and if I find it necessary to lie a little here and there so be it None of you will ever know the difference except for a handful of people who know me personally and for the most part I ve managed to alienate them sufficiently that they don t care I 'm just sayin you know 
I think one reason why such things don t both us as NLPers as much as they bother the average machine learning person is that we are willing to invest some energy in intelligent initialization This already puts us in a good part of the optimization landscape and doing local hillclimbing from there is not such a big deal A classic example is the Klein and Manning 's mart initializer for unsupervised parsing where a small amount of human knowledge goes a long way above a random initializer Another style of initialization is the IBM alignment model style IBM model 4 is of course highly non-convex and ridiculously difficult to optimize ( the E step is intractable ) So they do a smart initialization using the output of model 3 Model 3 too is highly non-convex ( but not quite so much so ) so they initialize with model 2 And so on down to model 1 which is actually convex and fairly easy to optimize This sequencing of simple models to complex models also happens in some statistical analysis where you first fit first order effects and then later fit higher order effects The danger of course is that you got to a bad hill to climb but this overall generally appears to be a bigger win than starting somewhere in the mi le of a random swamp ( Of course later Bob Moore had this cute argument that even though model 1 is convex we don t actually ever optimize it to the global optimum so doing clever initialization for model 1 is also a good idea ) These two ideas clever initialization and sequential initialization seem like powerful ideas that I would like to see make their way into more complex models For instance in the original LDA paper Dave Blei used an initialization where they pick some random documents as seeds for topics As far as I know no one really does this anymore (d oes anyone know why does it really not matter ) but as we keep building more and more complex models and lose hope that our off the shelf optimizer ( or sampler ) is going to do anything reasonable we re probably going to need to get back to this habit perhaps trying to formalize it in the meantime 
Overwhelmed by the massive 1 000 + card Yankee Stadium sets that have come out this year Me too That 's why I ve got a better idea If you want to celebrate Yankee Stadium in your own way collect those cards that feature it in the background The same can apply for those of you sick and tired of all things Yankee who would rather focus on Shea Stadium and the Mets Because Topps calls New York City its home many of its cards feature the two current New York City ballparks as part of the background 1970 was a big year that comes to mind immediately but there are plenty of others And the best part of these DIY Yankee and Shea Stadium legacy sets is that your sets won t be composed of just Yankees or Mets--your set will include most or all of the other major league clubs as well Now I 'm not a Yankees fan but something like this appeals to me as a fan of baseball history much more than a set full of cards of the same handful of players ad nauseam ( From sorting through a few thousand cards from the 1970s a Fenway Park Legacy set could also be put together this way ) 
To all my friends I 'm sorry I think about this blog often but can never find the time to write on it I have 3 of the 4 kids sleeping My 23 month old was taken to the hospital to get play dough taken out of his ear Yup the reason I have time to write is because my goofy son wanted to see what having play dough in his ear was like My wife just called and it 's out They ll be home in 5 minutes All is well at casa de la insano PS Robin is expecting again This will be number 5 god help us ) Time to get neutered I guess 
I 'm a fan of Elvis Presley It 's the fact that he was a bit of an ass that he was a drug a ict at the end that he had three TV 's that he had a Jungle Room at Graceland that he laughed and talked during live recordings that he was fond of ridiculous jumpsuits and that his album cover art was so darn cool I 'm not talking about the original Elvis Presley 's elf-titled album with the rock-a-billy photo and the green and pink text overlay that The Clash ripped off and seems an o -yet-completely-legitimate choice of inspiration for the design of the 1984 Topps set That album cover deserves its own separate dissertation I 'm talking about the gold lamé army of Elvii raining down on the cover of 50 000 000 Elvis Fans Can t Be Wrong I 'm not sure that 's even the name of the album come to think of it Doesn t matter The point I 'm trying to make is that if you squint real hard at the American League All-Star stickers that I 'm finding at an alarmingly common rate all decked out in their gold foil if you try real hard you can almost see Elvis smiling back Key word there is almost I guess what I 'm trying to say is that I 'm as gi y as a schoolgirl after opening 10 packs of stickers and not finding a single double Let that sink in Ten packs of five stickers each and no doubles I completed nearly 20 % of the set in one fell swoop Unheard of Unbelievable Especially in this box this treacherous box of Dusty Bakers and Hosken Powells Al Olivers and Chet Lemons Here they are in all their glory 
Contrary to what Donruss would want you to believe Fred McGriff never won an MVP award Did he ever deserve one No probably not But so what Teams need players like McGriff to be successful In a similar vein someone recently said that teams wouldn t win with a whole roster of Dustin Pedroias Why not The guy has over 200 hits 100 runs he hits for average he 's a good fielder what 's not to like Is it because he 's short Scrappy Prematurely bald Is it because he does that weird thing with his mouth and eyes before every swing The same could be said for Fred McGriff Could a team win with a roster of Fred McGriffs Who wouldn t want a bunch of guys consistently smacking 35 homers driving in runs and hitting for average Though until recently Pedroia had been putting together an MVP-like season guys like Pedroia and McGriff aren t really MVP-caliber players They re complementary guys They re guys who make a lineup formidable And though they re not a given lineup 's heavy hitter they re guys pitchers don t want to face in any situation They re like Thursday night It 's not quite Friday but you re almost there 
I get emails from my local card shop and in it I read today that Upper Deck canceled the remainder of its forthcoming baseball products including Goudey ( this must be what happens when you settle out of court with MLB Properties ) I also read that the USA baseball stuff it was going to produce will now be produced by Topps All of this is incredibly interesting to me and not simply because I collect sports cards It 's interesting to me because it all boils down to one person In my opinion all of this movement of the last year official licensing lawsuits and the like stems from Michael Eisner 's involvement in Topps And I d say that Major League Baseball wants to be in bed with a big guy like him not some small-pond guy like Richard McWilliam At Disney Eisner was a big fish in one of the biggest ponds He 's a brand name all unto himself and in the non-card universe I d bet more people have heard of Eisner than have heard of Topps and certainly more than Upper Deck This latest development brings back the question in 2007 why didn t Topps cave to Upper Deck 's bid of a dollar more than Madison Dearborn 's Did Shorin know something about a wind of change at MLB Properties Or was he simply looking out for the best interests of the company and the brand by a ) not selling to their number-one competitor and b ) by brazenly puffing out his chest and selling the company his way ( albeit not in the best interests of the shareholders ) without kowtowing to the upstart It could be a little of both The other question is did MLB Properties have a preference in who bought Topps I think Eisner has ushered in more good changes at Topps a shift to the Web with video and more meaningful interactions with the collector ( not just customer service stuff ) than Upper Deck ever would have or would have had reason to For Upper Deck to ever seriously think that Topps could be beaten in a one-on-one for exclusive MLB licensing is preposterous especially with a heavy hitter like Eisner in the mix So when 2010 Upper Deck debuted earlier this year it seemed like the company was on a collision course with a court date Seriously I get it that baseball is the biggest sport with the most money at stake but why did Upper Deck produce a regular set without being able to show team logos If they had to fill shipping quotas keep the cash flow going until they could get rid of their baseball team and hoodwink the public in the process why didn t they put out a set like Studio Or an innovative every-card-is-autographed prom-photo set of everybody in tuxedos Instead every card read like Upper Deck was thumbing its nose at Major League Baseball Also it feels like Upper Deck doesn t get it that a Topps exclusivity now does not necessarily mean a Topps exclusivity in the future Yes Upper Deck is losing millions now but possibly not future millions So why burn your bridges 
Sorrow and pity are natural responses to disability in children but they are misplaced researchers say There is no need to feel sad about youngsters with cerebral palsy because they experience life much as other children do with all its joys and sadnesses successes and failures Able-bodied adults tend to view such children in terms of the struggle they face and their lost potential for a full and active life But that is not how the children see themselves according to researchers from Newcastle University A study of 500 children with cerebral palsy in seven European countries has found that across a range of measures including psychological wellbeing self-perception and social support their levels of satisfaction are as high as in other children Though disadvantaged in some cases seriously their impairment is incorporated into their sense of themselves from birth and they embrace life and all it has to offer with the same excitement as other children Professor Allan Colver of Newcastle University who led the study published in The Lancet said it contained an important message for parents Parents can be upset when their child is diagnosed with cerebral palsy but they can now be reassured that most children with the condition who are capable of providing information at the age of eight to 12 have a similar quality of life to other children In earlier research he had shown that disabled children participated less in activities than other children because of the restrictions imposed by their disability But they were no less happy The new study showed their quality of life as reported by themselves was no different A father came up to me after we reported the results and said You have already made me think differently about my child Professor Colver said The findings reinforced the need for disabled children to be integrated into society he a ed The change now needed concerns attitudes Pity and sorrow should not be directed to disabled children because our findings indicate that they experience life as do non-disabled children Maximum effort is needed to ensure their rights as citizens rather than as disabled children to participate in society as fully as other children Julie Johnson of Gateshead whose 10-year-old son Nathan was diagnosed with cerebral palsy at four months said I treat Nathan and his brother the same and I have found that both of them rise to their own challenges Nathan has problems with his left hand but quite simple steps have enabled him to attend a mainstream school He is an active happy child Nathan said I like all my teachers and I have a big group of friends at school I have a special board which helps me to write neater At playtime we play tag and football 
We d arranged for Sam to come home today for a few hours a little while ago Then we got a call this morning trying to put it off as there were other staffing problems However several calls later it was decided Sam could come home We then got one from Sam to reassure him it was happening He picks up on all that is going on But when I picked him up he was very excitable We found later he had been like that all day I wonder if that had been the real reason they had been thinking of putting off his visit The visit kind of went well though until the end He seemed agitated He needed space He became surly in a way that threatened aggression As we got to the car he opened the door then slammed it even more open almost breaking it off and causing expensive damage Then he walked off down the road He had no intention of stopping He walked on We were fortunate the nurse with us was a very experienced one who we got on with We ve had similar situations to this with Sam so many times but another nurse might have reacted in a way that could have exacerbated the situation But his nurse joined Sam on his walk off and I brought up the rear staying at a distance at first in case I might make it worse Sam insisted on walking to some rocks where he used to climb He needed to feel the rock and sit calmly there for a while to get his thoughts together or to combat the demons in his head as he described it to his nurse Eventually we got him back to the car and back to the hospital He was still excitable but he was back and safe Now Jane and I will have a meal together watch some television open a bottle of bubbly and wish each other with thoughts of Nell and Sam Happy New Year A Happy New Year too to all of you reading this 
This post was very interesting because it explained both the positive and negative side of Sickle Cell Anemia The question at the end encouraged me to do further research and try to find other diseases that have the same heterozygote advantage After looking on many websites I found the same disease that was posted above Thalassemia This disease is similar to sickle cell anemia because it is a malfunction with the red blood cells Either there are not enough red blood cells or there isn t enough hemoglobin in the red blood cells which effects the oxygen flow This disease is inherited from the parents of the offspring There are four forms of this disease called Silent Carrier State Alpha Thalassemia Trait Hemoglobin H Disease Alpha Thalassemia Major The first listed had one affected gene the second has two affected genes the third has three affected genes and the fourth has four affected genes 
Imagine you have a friend who has a budget problem Every month he spends more than he earns His credit card bills are piling up He is clearly on an unsustainable path Then one day he comes to you with an idea Friend I am going to take off a few days from work and fly down to Bermuda for a quick vacation You But isn t that expensive Won t that just a to your growing debts Friend Yes it is expensive But my plan is deficit-neutral I have decided to give up that half-caf extra-shot caramel macchiato I order at Starbucks twice every day I really don t need that expensive drink And if I give it up for the next three years it will pay for my Bermuda trip You Well then how are you going to solve the problem of your growing debts Friend I am going to figure that out as soon as I return from Bermuda You But in light of your budget problem maybe you should give up Starbucks and skip the Bermuda vacation Giving up Starbucks could be the easiest way to start balancing your budget Friend You really aren t any fun are you This conversation is meant to illustrate why claims of deficit-neutrality in the healthcare reform bill should not give much comfort to those worried about the U S fiscal situation Even if you believe that the spending cuts and tax increases in the bill make it deficit-neutral the legislation will still make solving the problem of the fiscal imbalance harder because it will use up some of the easier ways to close the shortfall The remaining options will be less attractive making the eventual fiscal adjustment more painful 
One thing I always wanted a clear resin toilet seat the kind that comes embe ed with hundreds of pennies You can find this type of thing in gigantic Las Vegas souvenir stores and other fine outlets of all-American kitsch I mean c 'm on-- who doesn t like finding money where you least expect it So then let 's fast-forward to the end of September when Topps releases Treasury Basketball a product featuring cards literally stuffed with cash Each box is guaranteed a rip card with exactly 429 of them containing actual United States currency ( neatly folded 10 20 50 100 500 and 1 000 bills ) OK I can find a lot of problems with this the least of which being that Topps has to remove their pack disclaimer that they don t claim to know if cards will have any future value since 429 cards will be worth at least 10 But that 's petty in comparison to the pandora 's box this opens What Topps has created is a lottery Not just a pseudo-lottery that the card industry has become in general with packs containing rare autographs and game-used memorabilia but an actual one with predictable o 's and real money changing hands Kind of scary isn t it Here 's something else to consider let 's say you find one of the cards containing a 20 bill Do you open it up Or is it more valuable than 20 if you leave it intact Also what if it 's stamped with a 1 /50 serial number Does that make it more valuable than 20 But perhaps the harshest indictment of the state of the card industry is this Topps is proclaiming that finding actual cash in a pack is the next step in the evolution of the insert card And they may have caught on to something it is probably far cheaper to include cash in a product than spending lots more on securing contracts for autographs and game-used memorabilia And besides autos and relics have become so commonplace that finding one in a pack no longer carries the same weight it once did If cash cards in a basketball product with limited originality or appeal works the practice will soon become a staple of the hobby 
Notes Well that 's all she wrote With only 15 /75 new stickers my sticker album will be forever unfinished And only 11 stickers short So that means that within my box of 500 stickers I only got 249 individual stickers ( and 251 others ) What I find most interesting about this is the idea of where certain stickers appeared within the box and then how long it took to get a double and then sometimes a triple of that sticker the Pack Pocket hypothesis introduced in Sunday 's post Highlight stickers seemed to appear in the first third of the box World Series and League Leaders appeared in the last third and All-Stars appeared throughout Also I completed the Red Sox team page before receiving a single Padre and for a very long time was one Jim Palmer sticker from completing the Orioles team page only then to receive two Palmers within a few packs of each other towards the end of the box Other Notes This sticker of Omar Moreno has to be the worst sticker in the entire book Why isn t he facing the camera A sane person would not have known it was Moreno I ve been staring at the album cover for a while now and I 'm convinced that a ) the players obscured by the large 25 in the lower right corner are shown in team-less uniforms which is bizarre and b ) Gary Carter 's eyes are closed which begs the question Why didn t Topps use a photo of one of the World Series-winning LA Dodgers Like Valenzuela mid-windup or Ron Cey picking his nose And speaking of Dodgers like the other teams there are only eight players on the team page Ken Landreaux Dusty Baker Ron Cey Steve Garvey Pedro Guerrero Fernando Valenzuela Burt Hooton and Jerry Reuss OK so most of them are star players but because the team won the World Series I would ve thought that Topps would have given them a spread Because how would you feel if you were Davey Lopes Mike Scioscia or Bill Russell Or even Tommy Lasorda for that matter If anyone deserved a sticker it was Davey Lopes The guy was traded after the 1981 season to the A 's presumably because he was 36 But then he goes on to put up respectable numbers for six more seasons including a great 1985 with the Cubs where he steals 47 bases while getting caught only four times I 'm Davey Lopes Gimme my damn sticker Final Notes In the next few days I 'm going to do a post outlining the entire box just to see if there 's any reason to the madness of opening 100 packs and not finishing the set 
For any parent finding out that your baby or child has cerebral palsy is nothing short of devastating It 's hard to describe the emotional turmoil you begin to go through when you hear those two words confirmed for the first time It conjours up all sorts of terrifying thoughts and some of these I will try to convey over the coming weeks Cerebral refers to the brain and palsy to muscle weakness / poor control Cerebral palsy itself is not progressive ( i e the brain damage does not get worse ) However secondary conditions such as muscle spasticity can develop which may get better over time get worse or remain the same Cerebral palsy is not infectious It is not a disease and should not be referred to as such Although cerebral palsy is not curable in the accepted sense training and therapy can help improve function Ella and her twin brother Max were born extremely prematurely at just 26 weeks gestation (3 months early ) and I intend to talk about this in more detail as time progresses Extreme prematurity ( and prematurity in general ) present an increased risk of developing cerebral palsy Unfortunately during Ella 's stay in the various Neonatal Intensive Care Units ( NICU ) that saved her life she suffered extensive brain damage as a result of a fungal infection / haemorrhaging ( the subject of much debate between the hospitals that looked after her ) Miraculously and beyond all initial expectations our little soldiers Max and Ella came home to us in March 2006 So to kick this off it 's now 4 months since Ella was diagnosed as showing early signs of cerebral palsy ( CP ) As with all things web it 's very easy to get bogged down by information overload I know I ve been there several times I 'm hoping this blog will help to provide a central resource for other parents wanting to know more about CP and I hope to share our personal experiences with Ella as an ongoing journal 
About 2 or 3 weeks ago I went to Prestatyn in Wales with my mum stepdad sister and brother When we got there I wanted to go home because it was a lot busier than where we went to last year ( borth ) Anyway I stayed and I gradually got used to it A few days later I wanted to go on the go-karts but I was nervous So my stepdad and my brother went on first and then my stepdad and my sister went on 2nd then finally I went on I had I great time and because I did it I went on loads more times ( about 4 times ) throughout the holiday I loved walking on the beach and going into the water So I had a great time Thanks Mum and Stepdad for paying Thanks for reading bye 
I never saw Fred McGriff play in person And yet here he is in Fenway Park circa 1989-1990 A friend of mine used to have tickets about 20 rows behind home plate and I remember going to a number of games around that time Nor did I ever really watch games that McGriff played in My family like everybody else who got cable got all the Braves games on TBS But that didn t mean I watched them So then here 's my question Can I legitimately call McGriff my favorite player if I a ) never saw him play in person and b ) never made much of an effort to catch his games on TV I think I 'm safe McGriff fit what I was looking for in a baseball hero To me he was obscure And if you know anything about my values system obscurity ranks very high Oh sure he wasn t a face in the crowd to fans of the game But ask a random person on the street who McGriff was and I d bet nine out of ten wouldn t know And yet here 's the funny thing if McGriff had spent his career in a baseball mecca like Boston or New York I 'm completely convinced that his national presence would ve rivaled that of Boggs Mattingly or any other of his more famous contemporaries 
I 'm not sure whether I 'm doing this right or not as I ve never blogged before but I 'm in search of information regarding swallowing and blockage My wife and I are caregivers of my father-in-law who is in later stages of Parkinsons He was recently diagonosed with severe blockage of the throat as he chokes on everything he eats His only enjoyment in life has been eating and he refused the recommended feeding tube Is anyone are of any type of surgery in lieu of the feeding tube 
I started The Baseball Card Blog funny enough to blog about baseball cards Collecting baseball cards trading baseball cards buying baseball cards Dealing tongue firmly in cheek with the a iction of baseball cards Openly questioning the sanity of my own fawning over sports stars and their small cardboard representations But The Baseball Card Blog became other things as well though I tried very hard to keep it on topic This was not to be about my life unless my life somehow had something to do with baseball cards This was not to be a forum for ragging on private individuals I made a point of keeping angry thoughts private I poured a lot of time into this blog I spent a lot of energy writing the stuff I wanted to write dissertations I felt were needed on sparsely represented topics ( hello 1987 Topps ) artistic interpretations to epic odes of futility ( Casey at the Bat ) giving away cards I liked (T he Great Goudey Trade-away ) highlighting funny things about utilitymen bit players managers and bona fide stars I enjoyed this kind of thing And then I didn t I explored selling the blog I explored bringing in new writers Ultimately none of these were ideas I saw to completion The Baseball Card Blog was retired I a ed a link to the Wikipedia page for Casey at the Bat and nobody took it down I stopped writing But I didn t stop collecting Or reading others blogs I kept up with Cardboard Junkie (s till my favorite ) I started collecting the T118 (W orld 's Greatest Explorers ) and T218 ( Mecca / Hassan Athletic Champions ) sets I am just about 50 % complete on the 1962 Post Cereal set I started collecting 1956 Topps 1967 Who Am I and lots of miscuts printing errors and blank fronts and backs I even got in touch with The Baseball Reliquary in Monrovia California about donating a hard copy of the baseball-card Casey at the Bat but still haven t got my act together to send it along to them And all of these things slowly made me want to start writing about it all again Not religiously blogging three or four times a day so that it gets in the way of me living the rest of my life But simply writing about baseball cards when I have the time I had to take a year off Now it 's time to dust off the cobwebs tinker with the setup and see how long it will take me to put together a set by simply buying packs BH January 1 2010 
Two recent shareposts The Depression-Mania Two Step (P art I and Part II ) zeroed in on a crucial fact that tends to be overlooked by clinicians namely Despite the fact that depression and mania present as polar opposites the two can hardly be viewed as unrelated For our own health and safety they need to be seen together as part of the same cycling phenomenon Today 's depression is tomorrow 's mania but there is another twist Too often depression fails to clear the room Too often mania doesn t wait to be invited in The two show up at once The dance is over A free-for-all breaks out The experts refer to the condition as a 'm ixed episode or state Sweet mania turns sour Vegetative depression becomes animated Those who have been through either describe the experience as akin to wanting to crawl out of your skin of feeling the urge to grab the world by the throat and wring it I used to joke I get road rage a lot - and I don t even drive Amazingly for a condition so pronounced that causes so much distress the DSM-IV is inexcusably vague and so will its successor the DSM-5 (d ue out in 2013 ) based on draft proposals issued last month The good news is that the DSM-5 's criteria for a mixed state will be far less restrictive In light of the fact that in all other respects DSM-IV bipolar and DSM-5 bipolar are virtually identical this is a very significant development The current DSM recognizes mixed states only when full-blown depression is accompanied by full-blown mania Thus at least five ( of nine ) depression symptoms accompanied by at least four ( of seven ) mania symptoms Technically then only those with bipolar I qualify But in the real world individuals may experience depression accompanied by only two or three mania / hypomania symptoms Or mania with just two or three depression symptoms Don t these symptoms somehow count Yes says Ellen Frank PhD of the University of Pittsburgh In an interview several years ago Dr Frank explained to me that even isolated symptoms that don t cluster together to create episodes may be important A 2004 study she collaborated on with Giovanni Cassano MD of the University of Pisa found that just one symptom of mania ( the symptom list in the study was much longer and more refined than the DSM list ) in unipolar depression increased risk for suicidal ideation 4 2 percent More symptoms kept upping the risk So what do we do with these so-called unipolars Treat them as if they had pure depression According to Hagop Akiskal MD of UCSD in a journal article the nonrecognition of depressive mixed state is nothing short of a clinical tragedy because these are the very unipolar depressive patients who are likely to do poorly on antidepressants These would be your agitated depressions an unbearable energized psychic pain Looking at it from the mania / hypomania side of the divide In a 2003 grand rounds lecture at UCLA Trisha Suppes MD PhD of Stanford described having an epiphany while reading the DSM criteria for hypomania I said wait where are all those patients of mine who are hypomanic and say they don t feel good 
If you had ten seconds to grab a few things and dash out of your house before the world around you collapsed what would you grab A cell phone Your checkbook A clean pair of underpants Photos of your loved ones Your medications Or would you go directly for your favorite cards I 'm not writing this to make you feel bad about collecting sports cards and memorabilia when there are people suffering somewhere in the world nor to make light of the situation You don t need a sportscard blogger to tell you that the catastrophe in Haiti is a terrible thing and that you should help those affected in any way you can I would choose medications but that 's just me If you said that you would make a bee-line for your cards don t feel bad I don t think it 's wrong to feel real emotions towards your cards But let 's be practical here Choosing your sports memorabilia when what you really need is a toothbrush or your Social Security card may not work for more than a few minutes unless the sports memorabilia has some sort of value in a collapsed world And this could very well be the case It would not surprise me in the least that something like a Babe Ruth signed baseball could hold barter value in a collapsed world because of the possibility of the world being rebuilt at some point with the same rules and values system that existed before Sports cards themselves are a different much-less-convincing subject So instead of spending valuable seconds determining if you really want to save that sports card be it a 1957 Topps Frank Malzone or a 2008 Playoff Contenders Matt Ryan autographed rookie keep it in your wallet Sure carrying it around with you in your back pocket will beat it to pieces but that shouldn t matter if you two truly can t be separated 
So my youngest brother Sean challenged me to run in the Philadelphia Marathon in 2005 While I ve played sports all of my life I had never liked running We did it and I count it as my biggest athletic accomplishment to date It 's 2008 and I plan to run some 5ks 's and MAYBE ultimately build back to a marathon with a 3 30 goal Follow me as I battle Crohn 's disease and a busy schedule 
In case you haven t been following me on Twitter or Facebook the past few days Tricia was admitted into the hospital on Tuesday evening An x-ray during her oncology appointment on Tuesday showed something in her lungs fortunately he doesn t believe it is lymphoma it may be a fungal lung infection Tricia has been coughing for a few weeks so we figured something was going on She hasn t been feeling bad just a little more tired than usual and a visit last week to the local ER didn t show anything But last night after 24 hours in the hospital and a bronchoscopy that morning she had a fever of 103 She is feeling better this morning We are waiting for results from blood work and biopsies to determine what the problem is They have started her on IV antibiotics Because she will probably be at Duke through the weekend Gwyneth and I returned home ysterday afternoon We ll wait for the call to go back and bring Tricia home Thanks for your prayers for Tricia this week I ll update more when I can and give you an update on Gwyneth 's appointments later 
If you compare vision research with NLP research there are a lot of interesting parallels Like we both like linear models And conditional random fields And our problems are a lot harder than binary classification And there are standard data sets that we ve been evaluating on for decades and continue to evaluate on ( I 'm channeling Bob here :P) But there 's one thing that happens the difference of which is so striking that I d like to call it to center stage It has to do with 'm essing with our inputs I ll spend a bit more time describing the vision approach since it 's probably less familiar to the average reader Suppose I 'm trying to handwriting recognition to identify digits from zero to nine ( aka MNIST ) I get say 100 labeled zeros 100 labeled ones 100 labeled twos and so on So a total of 1000 data points I can train any off the shelf classifier based on pixel level features and get some reasonable performance ( maybe 80s-90s depending ) Now I want to insert knowledge The knowledge that I want to insert is some notion of invariance I e if I take an image of a zero and translate it left a little bit it 's still a zero Or up a little bit Of if I scale it up 10 % it 's still a zero Or down 10 % Or if I rotate it five degrees Or negative five All zeros Same hold for all the other digits One way to insert this knowledge is to muck with the learning algorithm That 's too complicated for me I want something simpler So what I ll do is take my 100 zeros and 100 ones and so on and just manipulate them a bit That is I ll sample a random zero and apply some small random transformations to it and call it another labeled example also a zero Now I have 100 000 training points I train my off the shelf classifier based on pixel level features and get 99 % accuracy or more The same trick works for other vision problem ( eg recognizing animals ) (T his process is so common that it 's actually described in Chris Bishop 's new-ish PRML book ) 
When players come into the league they either do or do not live up to their hype Doesn t matter who Alex Rodriguez Fred Lynn Bob Hamelin or Stephen Strasburg it seems like everybody is subject to hype ( A great movie about this in a roundabout way is Sugar ) But what about the guys who fly under the radar Guys who just sort of show up Where do they stand In a world dominated by information it 's hard to imagine a player making it to the majors today without at least one news source commenting on his talent ( or lack thereof ) I 'm not old enough to remember John Doherty His statistics suggest he didn t really belong in the major leagues or the high minor leagues for that matter but he hung around the California Angels for parts of two seasons (1974 1975 ) and triple-AAA for six others But you d think someone must remember him right You d think fans of the game or little kids collecting cards in the mid-1970s would know about John Doherty of the Angels And maybe they do but I d venture a guess that the circle is relatively small say limited to the Los Angeles California area The reason This card of Doherty (1975 Topps ) was his only Topps card Ever And it 's not a memorable card The only reason I pulled it from a stack last night was because I didn t recognize the face or the name and because his face was so close to the camera Right away that 's a bad sign possibly meaning no photo of him in game-play action or the batting cage for that matter was taken ( though he 's wearing a left-handed batting helmet ) Even the signature ( from his Topps contract ) emblazoned across his neck is hurriedly scrawled as if Doherty too was surprised by the dumb luck of his being called up The game 's history is filled with cup of coffee guys For some players that means one inning of mop-up duty or a few games as a fourth outfielder For others it 's parts of a few seasons or an exceptional first season followed by a disappointing second And then nothing We will remember Stephen Strasburg no matter how he performs in the majors just like we remember Clint Hurdle and Brien Taylor But John Doherty All I can say is Who 
There are tons of how to apply for academic jobs write-ups out there this is not one of them It 's been four years ( egads ) since I began my job search and there are lots of things I think I did well and lots of things I wish I had done differently When I entered grad school I was fairly sure that I eventually wanted a university job During high school my career goal was to be a high school math teacher Then I went to college and realized that no I wanted to teach math to undergraduates Then I was an advanced undergraduate and realized that I wanted to teach grads and do research Teaching was always very important to me though of course I fell in love with research later It was unfortunate that it took so long for me to actually get involved in research but my excuse was that I wasn t in CS where REU-style positions are plentiful and relatively easy to come by (s ystem development anyone ) However the more time I spend in grad school including an internship at MSR with Eric Brill ( but during which I befriended many in the NLP group at MSR a group that I still love ) I realized that industry labs were a totally great place to go too I ended up applying to basically everything under the sun provided they had a non-zero number of faculty in either NLP or ML I talked ( mostly off the record ) with a few people about post-doc positions ( I heard later than simultaneously exploring post-docs and academic positions is not a good idea hiring committees don t like to reconsider people I don t know how true this is but I heard it too late myself to make any decisions based on it ) applied for some ( okay many ) tenure-track positions some research-track positions ( okay few ) and to the big three industry labs I wrote three cover letters one more tailored to NLP one more to ML and one more combined three research statements (d itto ) and one teaching statement In retrospect they were pretty reasonable I think though not fantastic I don t think I did enough to make my future research plans not sound like 'm ore of the same 
There is a cool view of the whole non-parametric Bayes thing that I think is very instructive It 's easiest to see in the case of the Pitman-Yor language modeling work by Frank Wood and Yee Whye Teh The view is 'm emorize what you can and back off ( to a parametric model ) when you can t This is basically the backoff view where NP Bayes comes in is to control the whole what you can aspect In other words if you re doing language modeling try to memorize two grams but if you haven t seen enough to be confident in your memorization back off to one grams and if you re not confident there back off to a uniform distribution ( which is our parametric model -- the base distribution ) Or if you think about the state-splitting PCFG work (d one both at Berkeley and at Stanford ) basically what 's going on is that we re memorizing as many differences of tree labels as we can and then backing off to the generic label when memorization fails Or if we look at Trevor Cohn 's NP-Bayes answer to DOP we see a similar thing memorize big tree chunks but if you can t fall back to a simple CFG ( our parametric model ) Now the weird thing is that this mode of memorization is kind of backwards from how I ( as an outsider ) typically interpret cognitive models ( any cogsci people out there feel free to correct me ) If you take for instance morphology there 's evidence that this is exactly not what humans do We ( at least from a popular science ) perspective basically memorize simple rules and then remember exceptions That is we remember that to make the past tense of a verb we a -ed ( the sound not the characters ) but for certain verbs we don t go / went do / did etc You do little studies where you ask people to inflect fake words and they generally follow the rule not the exceptions ( but see * below ) 
Depressed isn t the same as sad It 's worse than sad Depression lies closer to numbness How do people who do not by the most wonderful roll of the genetic dice suffer from depression And further how much do they understand about those of us who do There 's been so much talk about depression on television and the internet that I d have to guess that the average non-depressive person has a better idea of what the story is than was the case decades ago Big Pharma has spent enormous sums of money explaining to people who suffer from clinical depression that it 's not their fault Typically the ads contain a quickly-shifting series of micro-vignettes showing the various forms depression can take You know them they show men and depressed women wallowing in misery Staring off into space Toying with their food Ignoring the obligatory confused and sympathetic golden Labrador Veiled hints about a lack of connubial bliss Pitying confused resentful glances from co-workers (P lease forgive the absence of my usual parallelism in the preceding phrases I 'm not thinking as clearly as I do most of the time Wait Maybe I 'm depressed Holy guacamole Batman ) Awright awright Here 's the gist of what I 'm muttering about Depressed isn t the same as 's ad It 's worse than sad Sadness is a relatively active state in that you re feeling something Depression in my vast experience both first- and second-hand lies closer to numbness When I 'm really getting beaten up by my chemicals I 'm not sad I 'm a complete zombie I 'm not afraid either My head keeps hearing or saying ( I 'm definitely not together enough to start an investigation of the issue of duality )\ Don t be sad don t be frightened Maybe the frost will work a big piece of a Palladian pediment loose and it will fall on your head as I 'm strolling up Madison Avenue and then you won t have to worry about being sad or frightened right It 's truly pathetic how comforting this possibility can be That 's it for now Depression has its icy hands wrapped tightly around my larynx But I 'm not sad You want to see sad watch someone who finds out that his golden retriever is terminally ill That 's sad I 'm just sitting here like a rutabaga trying to find the strength to go to tai chi 
Today I baked alive at Brimfield Flea Market in Brimfield Massachusetts If you ve never been there it 's 17 open fields strung along Route 20 which for three weeks of each year are crammed full of leathery-skinned antiques dealers junk collectors hoboes drug a icts and certified weirdos And a good time is had by all This year I went twice ( July and September ) each time filling up on weird stuff July 's big score was an uncut sheet of Wacky Packages from 1979 This time around I brought home a safe deposit box from an old bank which coincidentally is the perfect size for holding baseball cards I also scored on miscut cards On top of the major haul from Scott in New Jersey ( more on Scott 's Haul in a later post ) these cards are helping make miscuts my next big thing And just my luck all three of the miscuts I found today feature Hall of Famers 
For now anyway I missed the end of the Senate Appropiations meeting but according to an article from YourWestValley com and a couple of Facebook updates the measure failed in committee today by a 3 - 5 vote It could be brought back later via another striker so it won t be completely dead until the end of the legislative session However it 's an election year and all members of the lege are up for reelection in November and very few want to be viewed as someone who thwarted the will of the voters on this topic So for now enjoy this small victory perhaps the only one the average Arizonan will see until the November elections when they ll have the opportunity throw out the ideologues who have worked so diligently to undermine Arizona 's future Later 
Machine learning as a field has been very convex-happy for the past decade or so So much so that when I saw a tutorial on submodular optimization in ML ( one of the best tutorials I ve seen ) they said something along the lines of 's ubmodularity will be for this decade what convexity was for the last decade (S ubmodularity is cool and I ll post about it more in the future but it 's kind of a discrete analog of convexity There 's a NIPS workshop on the topic coming up ) This gives a sense of how important convexity has been There 's also a bit of an undercurrent of convexity isn t so great from other sides of the ML community ( roughly from the neural nets folks ) see for instance Yann LeCun 's talk Who 's Afraid of Non-convex Loss Functions a great and entertaining talk There 's a part of me that loves convexity Not having to do random restarts being assured of global convergence etc all sounds very nice I use logistic regression / maxent for almost all of my classification needs have never run a neural network and have only occasionally used svms ( though of course they are convex too ) When I teach ML ( as I 'm doing now ) I make a bit deal about convexity it makes life easy in many ways That said almost none of my recent papers reflect this In fact in the structure compilation paper we flat out say that non-linearity in the model ( which leads to a non-convex loss function ) is the major reason why CRFs outperform independent classifiers in structured prediction tasks Moreover whenever I start doing Bayesian stuff usually solved with some form of MCMC I ve completely punted on everything convex In a voting with my feet world I could care less about convexity For the most part if you re using EM or sampling or whatever you don t care much about it either Somehow we ( fairly easily ) tolerate whatever negative effects there are of non-convex optimization 
I 'm sure you ve heard of extrasensory perception ( ESP ) Well what I have is EAP or extra-allergy perception When you have allergic-asthma as long as I have this is a skill you develop Okay so I suppose you re wondering what EAP is Well it 's the ability to know when something around you is one of your allergy triggers It 's the ability to know what places you need to avoid Actually it 's quite a neat skill As far as I know I 'm the only person alive with this skill I ll give you an example As I enter another person 's home I can 's ense as soon as I walk in if that person has a dog And I know I need to either get out or prepare myself for an allergy or asthma attack As I enter my dad 's cabin for example I can sense that there are a lot of dust mites and molds and that I must not stay long I also get this feeling as I enter certain homes My EAP is pretty accurate too For example when I went to Florida a few years ago my wife wanted to spend the night at her cousins Well as soon as I entered that house I had this feeling I was going to have trouble I told her I was going to have a rough night Oh you ll be fine It 's all in your hea dshe said Voila at bedtime my allergies and early warning signs showed their ugly faces I was puffing on my inhaler all night and I was tired the entire next day When I got to my parents home the next day I received no such sensation I knew I d be safe during the rest of the vacation 
Cool post When doing research on deseases that can benefit a human body I was unable to find much However after thinking a bit more I came to the conclusion that common deseases such as colds can make you less vonarble to other deseases This is not due to the cold it 's selfe but to the reaction your body has due to the cold One of the reactions you body has when it detects a cold is nasal congestion which helps keep other viruses away Altough many do not apreciate nasal congestions it is essential when it comes to keeping your body healthy Here is some more information on nasal congestion 
I ve been held captive by the 1953 Topps E ie Mathews Mystique for years It 's officially my favorite card and I ve put off buying it until I had enough money for one in near-mint condition But then something strange happened I began to really love miscut cards And it turned out that there are a plethora of miscut cards from the 1953 Topps set Needless to say I jumped on this one as soon as I found it Here 's where it gets really great That other card that 's along the bottom It 's the lower tenth of Roy Campanella 's card who 's my other favorite player from Mathews era I think it 's interesting to note that using this card and the one of Clem Labine I posted previously as examples Topps seemed to line up their cards one row up one row down on their uncut sheets Because the design featured a black box along a portion of the bottom of each card you d think that this set would ve had a ton of miscuts 
Some of my first thoughts were How severe will it be Is Ella going to be diplegic hemiplegic quadraplegic How will she cope How will we cope ( both together and with Ella ) What happens to her when we re gone ( not too soon hopefully ) Some thoughts were purely selfish we re only human Some thoughts were misdirected rage looking for someone or something to blame etc some were of despair As the time passes it 's becoming easier I 'm fine why am I moaning I don t have CP I suppose it 's because we all want the best for our kids and CP doesn t fit in with that Of course it doesn t But one thing resounds every time I look at the both of them As 26 weeker preemies it 's a miracle they re even here 5 months of hell in NICU with doctors telling you that your kids are unlikely to make it through the night is enough to put your personal angst well and truly in place Most of the thoughts you begin to realise are selfish ones and it certainly starts to put other aspects of your life into perspective It 's Ella who counts at the end of the day and we owe it to her to do whatever we can to make her life as happy and enriched as we can Unfortunately Ella was also classified as severely deaf along with her brother back in May This made things even worse when I found out about her CP diagnosis I will never forget the moment when I asked the following question at one of their review clinics If Ella is deaf and she has CP how will she be able to communicate He simply replied The worst case scenario is that you re looking at life long care in a wheelchair He told it how it was but it really was the worst case scenario and the truth is you just don t know how it will pan out until they re around 18 months + Even then it 's an unwritten book At the time I went white felt sick and the room consisting of my wife and 5 of the community help team went deathly silent That 's the only way I can describe it My wife asked another question and we moved on 4 months on Ella is now showing signs of recovering from her hearing loss and she 's making great strides improving on many of the things she was unable to do We only suspected CP when she was lagging behind Max in her developmental progression At the end of the day she 's showing an overwhelming desire to overcome the problems that hinder her and it 's this that we will help her strive to achieve 
Something is wrong with this picture Yes there is no actual team depicted on this team card but perhaps more importantly there are no fountains beyond the outfield fence of Kauffman Stadium It 's one thing for a terrible team with no discernible national star ( Mark Grudzielanek and Emil Brown anyone ) to downplay a 100-loss season But it 's another thing entirely to rob a sure-to-be-boring card of its one potential highlight When they don t even bother to turn on the fountains you know they ve given up It 's almost like the Royals were trying to slip by undetected for the year It 's a bold move one that I 'm not sure I agree with but an interesting tactic nonetheless Let me see if I ve got this right if you don t put out a team photo nobody will remember how much you sucked 
to rndssis I have early onset PD was diagnosed in 98 and am progressing very slowly The reason for that I believe is that I primarily treat my PD with anti oxidants including CoQ10 and Cranberry Extract Also I delayed taking Sinemet as long as possible and if I were you I d get off it right away It makes the symptoms better but helps the disease progress because it metabolizes into a chemical that actually kills off the mitochondria in brain cells with oxidative stress If I were you I d try Comtan (s lows down the breakdown of dopamine ) and one of the dopamine agonists ( I take Mirapex tried Requip but it made me sick ) Even though your neurolgist won t like this ( If he won t do it get him to prescribe Sinemet too and just don t take it ) beleive me you will progress a lot more slowly 
Good news I 'm just back from my 6 monthly appointment with my rheumatologist When I arrived the nurses asked if I was settling back into Lincolnshire life after that famous holiday They wanted to know where I d been to do so much to my liver and were so amused that i had been staying in a convent in Jerusalem Cue jokes about communion wine They asked if anyone had commented on last weeks blood test and I said No not yet So she looked it up and said that it wasn t really good news because the liver results were a little bit higher yet Good job she d taken my blood pressure before telling me that But when I saw the consultant he wasn t bothered at all He has agreed that I can reduce the methotrexate to just 4 per week and is happy with how my joints are looking I specifically asked about the liver results and he said he thought they were more likely caused by the diabetes When I had last weeks blood test I also had the tests for my annual diabetes review and apparantly my cholestral is raised He didn t comment on the rest of the diabetic tests so that is a joy I have for next week when i have the review I have never taken my diabetes seriously because I ve always had enough to worry about with arthritis but now that is under control I know I ll have to think diabetes I ve only stopped eating chocolate because of the wish to lose weigh and the weght loss blog so you can see I have to rethink quite seriously Maybe it 's time I also joined the diabetes blog Well I d have an extra glass of wine to celebrate but it 's weigh in day tomorrow so have to watch the calories 
One of the basic tenets of the Tao of McGriff Be consistent Example Fred McGriff performed in post-season play the same way he did during the regular season consistently well Or I consistently get my hopes up only for it to result in heartbreak Staying up late to watch the Red Sox crush the will of the Anaheim of Los Angeles of Interstate 5 of California Angels has given me ample time to contemplate Vlad Guerrero and the importance of post-season performance in the eyes of Hall of Fame voters For all that has been said about Guerrero 's post-season drought I am completely convinced that when he is first eligible for the Hall of Fame he will be elected with one of the highest vote percentages in recent memory I 'm thinking in the neighborhood of 92-94 % on the first ballot I 'm not entirely convinced that post-season exploits should weigh that much in the mind of the voter Sure it will help McGriff 's case that his career postseason batting average is over 300 and he 's socked 10 post-season home runs Post-season success will also help someone like Curt Schilling His performance with the Diamondbacks in 2001 and with the Red Sox in 2004 and 2007 will bolster his resume in the eyes of the HOF voters But really if there 's anything that should push Schilling into the Hall it 's his character his playing through pain in clutch situations I for one don t think I could walk around with a tendon stapled to my ankle let alone pitch (W ell I guess I could if I was allowed to bring a folding chair to the mound and pitch to Little Leaguers And I was high on morphine ) 
I give you 1968 Topps 38 Tony Pierce with razor-sharp sides and corners and I-swear-it 's -original-gloss It 's well-centered on the front and the tid-bit of fantastical info on the back is incredible (T ony once struck out 5 batters in one inning at high school ) But best of all you ll go blind looking at it This particular piece of cardboard badly misaligned when it was time to hit the blue rollers in the printing process resulting in an almost 3-D effect on the team name and missing ink in other areas It all feels like a waste too since the photo is so boring ( it looks like the photographer asked Tony to take his hat off and gaze stoically into the distance like a tired farmer at the edge of a field ) If only this had happened to a card featuring a more dynamically posed player but this was 1968 so I guess that rules out Vicente Romo doing jazz hands (1970) or Dock Ellis thrusting the ball at the camera in an attempt to get the viewer as high as he was (1969) 
The representation put forward for this story is something like (1) negative-for-John ( the car won t start ) which leads to (2) motivation-for-John ( to get it started which leads to (3) positive-for-John ( it 's started ) when then links back and resolves (1) You can also analyze the story from Paul 's perspective and then a links that go between the two characters showing how things interact The rest of the paper describes how these relations work and how they can be put together into more complex event sequences (s uch as promised request bungled ) Again a high level representation of how stories work from the perspective of the characters So now I W hope that you R have an increased belief in the title of the post Why do I think this is interesting Because at this point we know a lot about how to deal with structure in language From a machine learning perspective if you give me a structure and some data ( and some features ) I will learn something It can even be unsupervised if it makes you feel better So in a sense I think we re getting to a point where we can go back look at some really hard problems use the deep linguistic insights from two decades ( or more ) ago and start taking a crack at things that are really deep Of course features are a big problem as a very wise man once said to me :\ Language is hard The fact that statistical association mining at the word level made it appear easy for the past decade doesn t alter the basic truth - ) We ve got many of the ingredients to start making progress but it 's not going to be easy 
This has nothing to do with asthma yet I 'm going to report it off to you anyway I had a 2-year-old kid I was just scheduled to give a breathing treatment He was actually diagnosed with pneumonia and doesn t need the treatment but that 's beside the point The reason I mention this here is because the kid when I entered the room was crying He kept saying over and over Mommy Mommy Yes He wanted his mommy He wanted the one person he is most attached to And yet she was no where to be found Once the child was admitted she went home So after I gave my treatment I sat with the kid I put on a cartoon on the TV and I talked to him It took a while but I eventually had him calmed down Then I sat with him for a while as he snuggled with his little stuffed puppy This kind of reminded me of when I was two and my parents left me in a hospital all alone Yes I was 2 years old in 1972 and my parents left me alone There was a policy back then that parents weren t allowed to stay in the hospital after hours so once visiting hours were over they had to go home

Every Wednesday my school takes groups of students out and you have options where you can choose to go The options this week where Swimming walking and gym I decided to go to the gym When we got there a man had to show you around and tell you how to use the equipment I didnt want to talk to him so I stayed with my teacher in the hall In the gym it was very loud music and a lot of people so I didnt go in I just stayed in the hall Then my teacher took me for a walk for a few minutes I am not going there next week thanks for reading bye 
A job I ve always enjoyed is planning In college I did the advertising and promotional planning for my school 's campus movie theater and one of my responsibilities at my old job was media planning for a variety of the firm 's clients ( media planning refers to deciding where and when an ad will run ) In my new job I ll be doing more of the same which is fine by me There 's just something about planning an event and then sitting back and watching it be a success that is exciting to me I guess I ve got a behind-the-scenes streak You could make an argument that McGriff 's career was all about excelling behind the scenes Before winning the 1995 World Series as part of the Atlanta Braves McGriff 's defining achievement came in 1990 when he was traded by the Blue Jays to the Padres ( with Tony Fernandez ) for Joe Carter and Roberto Alomar That was without a doubt one of the premier trades ( if not the trade ) of the early Nineties And it wouldn t have happened without Fred McGriff 
It 's that time of year The kids have had a bad run the past couple of weeks with yet more chest infections and colds The problem is always amplified by their chronic lung disease from being intubated for so long in NICU A new born baby is defined as having chronic lung disease if they have been oxygen dependent on a ventilator for at least 28 days from birth When infection gets into Max and Ella 's lungs it hits them for six and they cough for England In the past they ve needed a itional help with extra O2 when having a coughing fit but they are getting stronger and stronger at being able to fight it on their own now We re just grateful that we finally got the go ahead last November for their Synagis shots (p alivizumab ) to protect against Respiratory Syncytial Virus ( RSV ) RSV usually causes mild cold-like symptoms in adults and children But it can make premature babies and children with certain other medical conditions very sick In England 28 per 1000 hospital admissions in children aged under 1 year are attributed to RSV each year and in the US about 125 000 infants are hospitalised with severe RSV infections It is the leading cause of infant hospitalisation and is a significant problem for high-risk babies and children Full term babies get antibodies from their mothers during pregnancy and these help to fight RSV and other viruses But babies born prematurely often do not get enough antibodies before birth Each dose of the Synagis vaccine gives them enough RSV-specific antibodies to help fight RSV infection for about 30 days but at 4 000 a course it 's not cheap Doctors have to get special sanction from the Primary Care Trust Board to give the go ahead on every baby that needs it Madness Anyway their vaccinations seem to be working at the moment as they ve not had anything more than the colds / chest infections ( touch wood ) Sleep has obviously been a problem and it has been a big struggle helping them to settle at night Ella has usually been the one to have problems with sleeping but for a few weeks now she has been taking Vallergan ( an anti-histamine with sedative properties ) Seems to do be doing the trick at the moment Think I may try some tonight 
After reading this post I decided to check out how many heterozygote advantages actually exist out in the world I found a PLoS ONE post about heterozygote advantages that exist in sheep but the information was a little hard to digest Maybe someone else can understand it http // www plosone org / article / info :d oi %2 F10 1371 %2 Fjournal pone 0000125 I later found another site that explains three more examples of heterozygote advantages including a gene that exists in flies This gene gave flies improved viability but it made them very weak When a fly had a gene combination that included this viability allele and a regular allele the fly was slightly weak but had improved viability The advantages have outweighed the disadvantages though so the viability allele has spread through fly populations The site also includes information about how having one cystic fibrosis allele can prevent death from dehydration diseases like cholera Last on the site is the debate about wether or not Tay-Sachs disease has a heterozygote advantage in preventing tuberculosis 
I 'm the father of an 8 y / o boy with a learning disability He has seen a child-psychologist and a neurologist The neurologist saw my son when he was 6 years old and was very careful not diagnose him He was under the impression that my son had Dyspraxia and now 2 years later the more we ( my ex wife who is a family physician and I ) learn on it the more we think our son has it He is now in grade 2 but his reading and writing skills are at least 2 years behind curriculum Our son show 's no signs of hyperactivity and can concentrate very well when doing tasks such as building LEGO spaceships or Bionicles He can sit still in front of the television and watch a program or movie for a long time His mother has been wanting to try and put him on Ritalin in order to help his concentration at school In light of the very latest news about Ritalin ( CTV Canada AM Tom Kennedy on rejecting Ritalin http // watch ctv ca / news / latest / rethinking-ritalin / clip95418 ) I 'm wondering if we really should try medication as the last option for our son and for now to really try to do classroom accommodations and try to see what we could do in order to maximize his learning My ex also wanted to put our son on bio-feedback but I feel that he really would not understand the principles of bio-feedback at his age in order to make the best use of it I 'm just afraid that his mother might be trying to desperately seek anything that she might think might be useful for our son I want to try to avoid the panic attacks and go methodically and slowly at what might work best for our son Also I was wondering if Dyspraxia was a Sensory Integration Disorder Your input would be greatly appreciated 
OMG I would have never known that CTS was related to the spine cause I always thought it was localized to the wrists and arm Thanks for the reference to Pain Free at Your PC by Pete Egoscu I am pretty young right now and I don t show / feel any symptoms but I try to keep aware of these things as it would affect my career in computers in the not so distant future Thx

I suppose my biggest piece of advice for applying is ( to the extent possible ) find someone you know and trust at the institution and try to figure out exactly what they re looking for Obviously you can t change who you are and the work you ve done but you definitely can sell it in slightly different ways This is why I essentially had three application packages -- the material was the same the focus was different But importantly they were all true The more this person trusts you the more of the inside scoop they can give you For instance we had a robotics / ML position open ( which sadly we had to close due to budget issues ) but in talking to several ML people they felt that they weren t sufficiently robotics enough I think I was able to dissuade them of this opinion and we ended up getting a lot of excellent applicants before we shut down the slot Related it 's hard to sell yourself across two fields At the time I graduated I saw myself as basically stra ling NLP and ML This can be a hard sell to make I feel in retrospect that you re often better off picking something and really selling that aspect From the other side of the curtain what often happens is that you need an advocate ( or two ) in the department to which you re applying If you sell yourself as an X person you can get faculty in X behind you if you sell yourself as a Y person you can get faculty in Y behind you However if you sell yourself as a mix the X faculty might prefer a pure X and the Y faculty might prefer a pure Y Of course this isn t always true Maryland is basically looking for a combined NLP / ML person this year to compliment their existing strengths Of course this doesn t always hold this is something that you should try to find out from friends at the places to which you re applying For the application process itself my experience here and what I ve heard from most ( but not all ) universities is that interview decisions ( who to call in ) get made by a topic-specific hiring committee This means that to get in the door you have to appeal to the hiring committee which is typically people in your area if it 's an area-specific call for applications Typically your application will go to an admin first who will filter based on your cover letter to put you in the right basket ( if there are multiple open slots ) or the waste basket ( for instance if you don t have a PhD ) It then goes to the hiring committee Again if you have a friend in the department it 's not a bad idea to let them know by email that you ve applied after everything has been submitted ( including letters ) to make sure that you don t end up in the waste bin 
In NIPS 15 Jon Kleinberg presented some impossibility results for clustering The idea is to specify three axioms that all clustering functions should obey and examine those axioms Let (X d ) be a metric space (s o X is a discrete set of points and d is a metric over the points of X ) A clustering function F takes d as input and produces a clustering of the data The three axioms Jon states that all clustering functions should satisfy are Scale invariance For all d for all a 0 F ( ad ) = F (d) In other words if I transform all my distances by scaling them uniformly then the output of my clustering function should stay the same Richness The range of F is the set of all partitions In other words there isn t any bias that prohibits us from producing some particular partition Consistency Suppose F (d) gives some clustering C Now modify d by shrinking distances within clusters of C and expanding distances between clusters in C Call the new metric d Then F (d\ ) = C Kleinberg 's result is that there is no function F that simultaneously satisfies all these requirements Functions can satisfy two but never all three There have been a bunch of follow on papers including one at NIPS last year and one that I just saw at UAI If you think about these axioms a little bit they kind of make sense My problem is that if you think about them a lot of bit you ( or at least I ) realize that they re broken The biggest broken one is consistency which becomes even more broken when combined with scale invariance What I 'm going to do to convince you that consistency is broken is start with some data in which there is ( what I consider ) a natural clustering into two clusters I ll then apply consistency a few times to get something that ( I think ) should yield a different clustering Let 's start with some data The colors are my opinion as to how the data should be clustered 
Hello everyone My stepdad Timothy Blackburn A K A Mistrust has just recently done a remix for New Zealand band Pitch Black The song that he has remixed is called Rude Mechanicals so please listen The song is on Mistrust 's Myspace page is a sample of the song because the full song is being released on 27th of October this year So please listen and tell me what you think 
Fred McGriff was selected by the Yankees as the last pick in the 9th round of the 1981 June draft fresh out of high school and then as soon as he started to get his feet wet BLAM Traded to the Blue Jays with Dave Collins and Mike Morgan for Dale Murray and Tom Do Drafted one summer traded the end of the next year That 's either a major confidence booster ( that another team would want him ) or a huge letdown ( the most storied team in the sport gave up on him enough to throw him in on a minor trade ) As fans it 's exciting to welcome new players onto our favorite teams but what about how the players themselves feel It 's no wonder that many reiterate to the media that it 's just a business and this is the way this business works Because what are the alternatives You can pout go AWOL or grit your teeth say goodbye to your friends and pack your suitcase for the next town I 'm a Red Sox fan but it 's not hard to see why Brian Giles though marooned on a terrible Padres team wouldn t accept a trade to the contending Sox He has a life to consider and he 's been around long enough to be afforded a choice in his future Why would you sacrifice that ( I ve never been traded But if I were I bet I could bring at least fifteen head of cattle and a few bushels of wheat Or a bag of balls ) 
In my most recent Times column about the President 's budget I wrote Making matters worse these bleak budget projections are based on relatively optimistic economic assumptions The administration forecasts economic growth of 3 0 percent from the fourth quarter of 2009 to the fourth quarter of 2010 followed by 4 3 percent the next year By contrast the Congressional Budget Office predicts growth of 2 1 percent and 2 4 percent for these two years Lower growth would mean less tax revenue larger budget deficits and a more rapidly increasing debt-to-G D P ratio The CBO has now reestimated the budget effects of the President 's proposed policies and indeed the CBO forecasts larger budget deficits The CBO 's total deficit projected over the decade-long budget window is 1 2 trillion larger than the administration 's estimate The administration projects that the federal government debt held by the public would rise to 77 percent of GDP in 2020 ( from 53 percent in 2009 ) The CBO forecasts a debt-GDP ratio in 2020 of 90 percent 
I must tell you that having a big family assures me of never running out of stories to blog about This evening Amanda was helping Robin make butter nut squash soup Apparently you have to cook all the vegetables on the stove top and then while it 's still hot puree it in a food processor As Robin was finished pureeing the delicious smelling soup and transferring it out of the food processor back into the pot Amanda pulled a chair up to the kitchen counter to see what her mommy was making As Amanda was watching her mother throw a itional spices into the mix Amanda decided that it was her turn She picked up our cordless telephone and in it went My telephone that was a beautiful metallic grey was now dripping squash orange I thought that it was dead Obviously if the liquid didn t kill it the heat would have right I was amazed I took a damp towel and dried it off the darn thing still worked After about a half hour we received a phone call and Robin picked up She noticed that it was difficult to hear the person at the other end because squash had gotten into the ear holes I ll wait until it dries up and I ll use a toothpick to clear it out 
My ADHD kicks in almost exclusively when I 'm dealing with abstract situations I believe that in an earlier Treating Adult A Blog posting I mentioned my perhaps-Romantic attraction to craftsmanship and my regrets that I d not pursued say tool-and-die making or furniture building in my youth (S aying I believe I mentioned 'm eans as those of you who stop by this stand regularly know that I may have done so may not have done so may think I ve done so but haven t or may think I haven t but have Or that the whole megillah is a fabrication Fabrication That 's a woodworking joke Right OK I 'm moving officer I 'm moving ) Whatever the antecedents it 's worth mentioning again ( or not again WHAT NOT AGAIN ) why I 'm attracted to benchwork The simple version is that in my case the ADHD kicks in almost exclusively when I 'm dealing with abstract situations ( And as I wrote in my blog the other day when I 'm dealing cards ) (S orry about all the parens but there was this going-out-of-business sale at the local Font Hacienda last week and obviously the ellipses which FYI are properly set as a single character ( and these double arrow thingies are called guillemets and the French use them as quotation marks ) but we can start our discussion of typography some other time OK ) zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz Sorry It 's tiring balancing all those parens ( that 's a proofreader 's joke son ) Well obviously typing doesn t count as craftsmanship because you can see how far down the slippery slope I ve already ski ed here As a matter of fact I 'm going to go for a walk now and see if I can get all of these random glyphs out of my head I ll be back shortly and we can talk about curly quotes which the stupid lines around curly quotes aren t And then we can get back to marquetry And tool-and-die making And locksmithing Honey do you remember if I took my Concerta this morning 
I have had asthma and allergies my entire life While I bet many asthmatics might disagree with me on this I think having allergies is far worse than having asthma Yes I did say that I think allergies suck Asthma is actually easier to control than allergies Even after I was on Advair and finally had my asthma under control the allergies continued to irritate the crap out of me Sure there are allergy shots but those things did nothing for me but sting my arm once a week for three years Sure there were antihystamines and decongestants and nasal sprays but if I 'm around one of my allergens those only took the edge off of that annoying feeling you get in your sinuses and nose You sneeze You get a runny nose You feel down right miserable I d rather have an asthma attack A worse case scenerio for asthma is you have to go to the ER Yet even in the ER there is nothing they can do for allergy symptoms This did change however with the invention of Singulair Man that drug is awesome - for me anyway Advair really helps too Now I can actually be around something I 'm allergic to and survive -- like during this flare up With Singulair my asthma flares still occur if I 'm exposed to my allergens although the flares are not near as bad as they used to be 
Earlier today on my way home from physical therapy I stopped by the gym No I did not go there in order to work out or exercise Instead I collected my yoga mat and turned in my locker key A few months ago I went through the same routine feeling all the while defeated by my inability to go to the gym This time around I 'm approaching things from a different perspective For the past few years yoga has been an important part of my life After having my knee muscles atrophy ( and subsequently losing the use of my knees ) during one of my pre-diagnosis flares and after months of daily recuperative physical therapy I was determined that I would not let that happen again so I signed up for yoga classes Within a year I shed almost 50 pounds was much more flexible and was feeling great Within two years I was performing handstands and forearm stands of all types was hooking my foot into my elbow behind my head while in pigeon pose and was coming close to perfecting an unsupported ( no arms ) headstand On some days I would do power yoga in the morning and power pilates in the evening I was feeling fit and I was loving it 
This is truly an amazing story Late last month Chris Wa ell became the first paraplegic climber to summit Mt Kilimanjaro in Tanzania - on his own power This amazing athlete used a specially designed buggy that he pe led with his hands to pull himself up the 19 340-foot mountain the highest in Africa The four-wheeled cycle Chris used called a Bomba is essentially a highly engineered four wheel mountain bike capable of taking on one-foot-high boulders Obviously this wouldn t be an easy task for Chris In fact it took him three days and 22 hours of pedaling to push through the last three miles The dense scree and sand at the top of the mountain - at roughly a 45 degree angle - made the going extremely difficult and slow Chris said that he was moving about a foot a minute at one point On his One-Revolution blog site Wa ell sai dI felt like I d made a statement that we as people could do whatever we wanted but more profoundly I saw the benefits of giving someone an opportunity Mr Wa ell broke his back in a freak skiing accident 21 years ago Since then he has won 12 medals in downhill ski racing over the course of four Paralympic Games 
Nice little workout this morning at the BSC Westborough today After getting to the gym I hit the treadmill for a nice 3 mile run I started at 7 5 and quickly upped it so that the bulk of the running was over 8 0 I ended up finishing the 3 mile run in 20 59 for an average pace of 6 59 / mile with 419 calories burned After the run I hit the free weight area for some shoulder exercises I did standing shoulder shrugs with dumbbells standing shoulder raises sitting long bar pulldowns and finished with 150 abs 
I need your help I ve been page by page through the 2009 Standard Catalog of Baseball Cards and I can t identify this More precisely I can t identify the player the team or the issue I have a pretty good idea what era it 's from (p re-1919 ) but even of that I 'm uncertain Some background I ve had this postcard at least 20 years I can t remember exactly where I got it but either a family friend who collected postcards and knew I liked baseball stuff or from the Big Box of Awesome Tobacco Pins I inherited from my great-grandfather Also it 's the size of a regular postcard not a cabinet That 's all I know about it My guess is that the uniform is from one of these types industrial team an amateur team or some sort of low minor league I ve never seen any other cap with a number on it like this nor do I have any idea what the CAD down the front of the flannel stands for The back is almost blank which isn t helpful and there 's no photographer 's seal or trademark anywhere on the card which isn t helpful either but leads me to think this isn t part of a large ( or any ) set So what do I have here 
thimerosal containing vaccines do not cause autism The decisions are in for the second phase of the Omnibus Autism Proceedings the vaccine court trials to determine if autism can be considered as a vaccine injury The first set of decisions were handed down last year ( those regarding the MMR as a causative agent ) This set explored whether thimerosal the mercury containing preservative formerly used in childhood vaccines could cause autism The decisions are long and I expect there to be much discussion Below are the final paragraphs from the decisions These are for the three test cases the hearings held for three specific children who petitioned for compensation on the basis of autism as a vaccine injury They are clear and decisive the evidence does not support thimerosal containing vaccines as causing autism in general or in these three children in specific 
Here 's a question How many shots did it take for Al Oliver to settle on this bat Also if he ran out of bats would he have posed holding a metal folding chair You may have been wondering what happened to Ben and why doesn t he post as much as he used to Well a lot is going on I work two jobs I teach blogging at MIT on weekends and I 'm winding down as a baseball card blogger I know I ve made a number of different assertions as to the future of The Baseball Card Blog but here 's the truth I will stop writing The Baseball Card Blog as of January 1 2009 if not sooner The blog itself will stay up as a fully tagged and searchable archive of everything I ve written over the past three years I ve thought long and hard about this and I ve decided that The Baseball Card Blog needs to end In my opinion the best card blogs are those with a finite topic For example the stellar 1988 Topps Blog where Andy K posts something about each and every card in the 1988 Topps and Topps Traded sets When the sets end the blog ends It makes sense But an open-ended blog about one collector reminiscing and finding his way back into the hobby he once loved Three years is enough of that for me I 'm not really interested in writing about the latest hobby trends or new cards that I can t afford When I really think about it those are the very things that caused my interest to wan in the first place I will still collect and will remain open to trading I will remain as the admin contact at A Pack A Day as well as our brand new vlog spin-off APADtv Finally I know I ve made it a point to stick to the script on baseball cards but I thought I d make an exception If you are vegan or enjoy vegan food and live in the San Francisco Bay Area do yourself a favor and take a look at this new blog Vegansaurus And if you ve never tried vegan food it 's better than you think 
Robin has gone off to one of her Physician Assistant conferences and will be away until Friday which after the first day as Mr Mom feels like it will be a Friday in a new millennium This is one of those times where a time machine would come in handy I believe that this is where my being obsessive compulsive shines I like order I need order to survive and I need order to feel comfortable That said trying to be orderly with 4 kids 7 and under doesn t exactly come easy To maintain that path I must operate on all cylinders all the time and even then to sustain order I need to take 2 minutes out of every hour to take a deep so that my head doesn t explode My OC is a safeguard and assures me that nothing falls through the cracks when taking care of my kids I 'm sure you have a clear image in your head of me running around as if my hair was on fire but I can assure you that things are well under control The house is clean the kids are dressed in clean clothes they re fed they re on time for school and most importantly happy My obsessive compulsive disorder was never diagnosed but people around me have told me that I have some characteristics of someone whom is OCD I ve gotten better at controlling it which has makes my wife 's life a bit less stressful I don t get bent out of shape as much anymore if the house is in complete disarray oh it bothers me but I try to redirect my energy elsewhere to be more productive Well that 's all for now 
Now 72 I was diagnosed early 1999 and had a 6 year honeymoon but now getting difficult ( freezing pain sleep deficit etc ) and have adopted an Aged care hostel a good one However the other people here ( two only ) who have PD are much worse than i ( as i see them ) i came across the following ln the advanced stage of disease the Advanced Care directive takes on an active role The patient family or proxy and healthcare provider should intermittently review the advance directives as to the patient 's wishes about pain management fatigue nausea vomiting bowel disorders artificial hydration artificial dementia agitation nutrition and restlessness so it seems to me the last year or two of living with PD is as challenging / difficult as some types of cancer HIV or I started writing PEACE CALLS in honour of a proper Dying with Dignity policy which does not yet apply in Australia and to reflect my ecological perspective Peace Calls 
Like everything else I could be weeks months or possibly even years late on this Well probably not years because as far as I can tell this is something new for 2008 I 'm referring to a new promotion Topps is going to roll out for their football products in 2008 called Topps Player Collection The gist of it is that the 30 best players will be found on the same checklist numbers in every Topps NFL set for 2008 It 's an interesting idea and you have to think that if it tests positive with dealers and collectors something like this will end up as the practice for other sports The problem I see with it carrying over to other sports is that it throws off the meritocratic checklisting system Topps baseball really just put back into circulation Let 's say Albert Pujols is 500 in 2009 Topps Does this mean that every Topps baseball set will have at least 500 cards Or is it much more likely that cards 1 through 30 are super stars Also here 's a great piece by Tyler Kepner in today 's New York Times about major leaguers and their fantasy football teams 
I 'm having a rare asthma flare up today The reason is because I hired someone to make a new bedroom in the basement for my son and all the sawdust and dust mites being spewed up through the vents is killing me Well it probably doesn t help that I ve been cleaning the upstairs bedrooms but that 's done now Keep in mind I 'm not as bad as I would be if I weren t on all these great new controller meds although I can definitely notice my early warning signs 1 Tight chest 2 Itching feeling in neck area 3 exhaustion 4 Urge to sneeze 5 Nasal congestion 6 Runny nose 7 gut feeling 8 Ventolin isn t working 9 Can smell all the allergins in the air ( a unique skill I have More on this later ) Now I ve been meaning to talk about this for a while but my asthma is unique in that no matter how I feel my peak flows do not change For example I just blew into my peak flow meter and my PEFR was 690 Keep in mind my personal best is 730 so 690 puts me right in my normal range 
I currently find myself in a much better place than where I was a week ago Sure the pain is still there but it is neither as intense nor as constant as it was just a few days ago Up until a few months ago when I was in this same situation I would have still been struggling for the pain to go away completely Even though the worst of the flare had subsided my feelings of anger and sadness would continue to grow I ( mistakenly ) believed that I could not be happy until my rheumatoid arthritis went away completely Now if the pain is somewhat moderate and focused on only a few joints I find this a blessing Better yet I find myself at peace and happy Just yesterday when I was at physical therapy my therapist and I were talking at how well I handled this latest flare Sure there were a few moments when the pain seemed too much to bear but as soon as they passed I got back on track and focused more on doing the things that I needed to do to take care of myself 
Welcome to everyone to ACL It 's pretty rare for me to end up conferencing in a country I ve been before largely because I try to avoid it When I was here last time I stayed with Yee Whye who was here at the time as a postdoc at NUS and lived here previously in his youth As a result he was an excellent tour guide With his help here 's a list of mostly food related stuff that you should definitely try while here (s ee also the ACL blog ): Pepper crab The easiest to find are the No Signboard restaurant chain Don t wear a nice shirt unless you plan on doing laundry Chicken rice This sounds lame Sure chicken is kind of tasty Rice is kind of tasty But the key is that the rice is cooked in or with melted chicken fat It 's probably the most amazingly simple and delicious dish I ve ever had Yet Kun ( or something like that ) is along Purvis street Especially for dessert there 's Ah Chew a Chinese place around Liang Seah street in the Bugis area ( lots of other stuff there too ) Hotpot is another local specialty there is very good spicy Szechuan hotpot around Liang Seah street For real Chinese tea here ( Funny aside when I did this they first asked have you had tea before Clearly the meaning is have you had real Chinese tea prepared traditionally and tasted akin to a wine tasting But I don t think I would ever ask someone have you had wine before But I also can t really think of a better way to ask this ) Good late night snacks can be found at Prata stalls ( eg indian roti with curry ) The food court at Vivocity despite being a food court is very good You should have some hand-pressed sugar cane juice -- very sweet but very tasty ( goes well with some spicy hotpot ) Chinatown has good Chinese dessert ( eg bean stuff ) and frog leg porridge 
The College Baseball Blog continues our weekly awards today by honoring Florida International outfielder Jabari Henry and Texas RHP Taylor Jungmann In five games last week Henry went 9-for-18 for a 500 batting average and a 1 389 slugging percentage Over the five games he hit five home runs two of which were grand slams registered 17 RBI scored nine runs and totaled 25 bases He had multi-home run games in two of the five games He also drew three walks stole two bases and threw a runner out from left field trying to stretch a single into a double at second base Jungmann was outstanding on Friday night as he pitched 7 1 innings while giving up a first inning run He ended up giving up five hits and walking only one hitter His most impressive stat was the fact he recorded 17 strikeouts in a possible 22 outs as the Iowa Hawkeyes struggled to find a rhythm The 17 strikeouts was a career-high and fell just two short of the school record set by Burt Hooton in a 13-inning game against Texas Tech in 1971 and tied by Eric Stone in a nine inning game against Southwestern Louisiana ( now Louisiana-Lafayette ) in 1998 
So what I d like someone to do is to argue to my why consistency is actually a desirable property I can come up with lots of other examples One reason why this invariance is bad is because it renders the notion of reference sizes irrelevant This is of course a problem if you have prior knowledge ( eg one thing measured in millimeters the other in kilometers ) But even in the case where you don t know knowledge what you can do is take the following Take data generated by thousands of well separated Gaussians so that the clearly right thing to do is have one cluster per Gaussian Now for each of these clusters except for one shrink them down to single points This is possible by consistency Now your data basically looks like thousands-1 of clusters with zero inter-cluster distances and then one cluster that 's spread out But now it seems that the reasonable thing is to put each data point that was in this old cluster into its own cluster essentially because I feel like the other data shows you what clusters should look like If you re not happy with this apply scaling and push these points out super far from each other ( I don t think this example is as compelling as the one I drew in pictures but I still think it 's reasonable Now in the UAI paper this year they show that if you fix the number of clusters these axioms are now consistent (P erhaps this has to do with the fact that all of my weird examples change the number of clusters -- though frankly I don t think this is necessary I probably could have arranged it so that the resulting green and blue clusters look like a single line that maybe should just be one cluster by itself ) But I still feel like consistency isn t even something we want 
Performance at a default setting of the hyperparameter For instance SVM-light uses something like average inverse norm of the data vectors as the C parameter Or you could just us 1 like I do for logreg In particular suppose you re testing your algorithm on 20 data sets from UCI Pick a single regularization parameter ( or parameter selection scheme ala SVM-light ) to use for all of them and report results using that value If this is about the same as the I carefully tuned 's etting I 'm happy If it 's way worse I 'm not so happy Performance within a range Let 's say that if I do careful hyperparameter selection then I get an accuracy of X How large is the range of hyperparameters for which my accuracy is at least X *0 95 I e if I 'm willing to suffer 5 % multiplicative loss how lazy can I be about hp selection For this you ll probably need to grid out your performance and then do empirical integration to approximate this Of course you ll need to choose a bounded range for your hp ( usually zero will be a lower bound but you ll have to pick an upper bound too -- but this is fine as a practitioner if you don t give me an upper bound I 'm going to be somewhat unhappy ) Neither of these is totally ideal but I think they d be a lot better than the current situation of really having no idea Maybe there are other proposals out there that I don t know about or maybe other readers have good ideas But for me if you re going to convince me to switch to your algorithm this is something that I really really want to know ( As an aside Mark if you re reading this I can imagine the whole CW thing getting a bit confused if you re using feature hashing have you tried this Or has someone else ) 
We just need to make sure that around home we keep our expectations of him high I think I baby him and don t push him and that certainly is not doing him any favors So I 'm working on that 
I have had CTS for 15 years and it is often aggravated by yard work ( rake shovel are worst ) more than computer work even though I work on a keyboard all day After a hard day of work in the yard I find that icing the top bottom of my wrists for about 45 mins per side can really help I keep the ice on one spot for 10-15 mins then move it to the other side of the same wrist and repeat until the 45 mins are up Then I ll do the other hand / wrist I do the icing routine right after I finish in the yard and then again the next morning when I get up All that being said I am getting close to the point of being unable to keep the CTS at bay through reducing yard work and icing Steroid shots in the wrist broke a couple of really bad cycles for me as well but I am close to taking the advice from my friends who ve had the surgery and are now symptom-less and just getting the thing done 
I really enjoyed Mark Dredze 's talk at EMNLP on multiclass confidence weighted algorithms where they take their CW binary predictors and extend them in two ( basically equivalent ) ways to a multiclass / structured setting ( warning I haven t read the paper ) Mark did a great job presenting as always and dryly suggested that we should all throw away our perceptrons and our MIRAs and SVMs and just switch to CW permanently It was a pretty compelling case Now I 'm going to pick on basically every yet another classifier paper I ve read in the past ten years ( read ever ) I 'm not trying to point fingers but just try to better understand why I personally haven t yet switched to using these things and continue to use either logistic regression or averaged perceptron for all of my classification needs ( aside from the fact that I am rather fond of a particular software package for doing these things -- note though that it does support PA and maybe soon CW if I decide to spend 10 minutes implementing it ) Here 's the deal Let 's look at SVM versus logreg Whether this is actually true or not I have this gut feeling that logreg is much less sensitive to hyperparameter selection than are SVMs This is not at all based on any science and the experience that it 's based on it somewhat unfair ( comparing megam to libSVM for instance which use very different optimization methods and libSVM doesn t do early stopping while megam does ) However I ve heard from at least two other people that they have the same internal feelings In other words here 's a caricature of how I believe logreg and SVM behave 
I haven t purchased a pack or any single cards from a Topps Heritage product in over two years ( the last one I collected was Heritage 59 in 2008 ) I did this for a variety of reasons most notably because I just didn t have the income to justify collecting another new set I also stood ( and continue to stand ) firmly in the belief that the Heritage brand should ve ended with the Heritage 59 (2008) set and that Topps should ve rechristened the subsequent sets as Topps Classic In any event I ve been thinking about this year 's Heritage (\ 61 ) and I think I ve hit upon a way to make the brand more appealing The Heritage checklister has done an admirable job updating checklists from the original sets and filling in each spot with its twenty-first century player equivalent They haven t gotten everything right ( as an homage to 1960 's card 1 Cy Young-winner Early Wynn of the White Sox 2009 's card 1 was Mark Buerhle of the White Sox it should have been one of the reigning Cy Young winners Cliff Lee or Tim Lincecum ) but 100 % accuracy is not something any card company should be expected to achieve But a sly wink and an inside joke to an original checklist is no longer enough to buoy a set The company has to continue to push the envelope or else they ll begin to lose the audience or make them cynical about the checklisting tactics used (\ Thom Glavine anyone How about those annoying black backs versus green backs from the Heritage 59 set ) The next logical step is the photo homage Not just one or two photos sprinkled over the checklist either If they made every photograph on every card an homage to its checklist bu y from the original set that would be something to write home about something that would elevate the Heritage brand out of the retro-design doldrums Of course to accomplish this the Topps photographers would have to actually study the original set and pose their subjects down to the minutest detail They d also have to shoot their photos with an idea of recreating the photographic standards of the 1960s Presumably color-correcting of this caliber is something that Adobe Photoshop could assist in accomplishing I ve never been a huge fan of the 1961 set I think the design is one of Topps weakest of the decade and the era and the photos fairly unimaginative Really the only great part of the set are the subsets ( the Brady Bunch-esque League Leaders the MVPs the All-Stars the combo cards Lindy Shows Larry anyone the World Series cards and the Historical Highlights ) an idea that exploded in 1961 and came to dominate the Topps Sixties It would be great to get Josh Shows Daisuke in my pack of Heritage 61 and not have it be two silhouetted shots of the individuals placed near each other I d appreciate the homage much more if Josh Beckett was smiling awkwardly while showing Daisuke Matsuzaka how to throw a curve 
That is if you really tune the regularizer ( lambda ) well then SVMs will win out But for the majority of the settings they re either the same or logreg is a bit better As a result what do I do I use logreg with lambda =1 That 's it No tuning no nothing ( Note that as I said before I haven t ever run experiments to verify this I think it would be a moderately interesting thing to try to see if it really holds up when all else -- eg the optimization algorithm early stopping implementation choice of regularizer ( L1 L2 KL etc ) and so on -- are held constant maybe it 's not true But if it is then it 's an interesting theoretical question hinge loss and log loss don t look that different despite the fact that John seems to not like how log loss diverges why should this be true ) This is also why I use averaged perceptron there aren t any hyperparameters to select It just runs What I d really like to see in future yet another classifier papers is an analysis of sensitivity to hyperparameter selection You could provide graphs and stuff but these get hard to read I like numbers I d like a single number that I can look at Here are two concrete proposals for what such a number could be ( note I 'm assuming you re also going to provide performance numbers at the best possible selection of hyperparameters from development data or cross validation I 'm talking about something in a ition ): 
Over the past year there were many moments when I just wanted to be left alone I didn t want to hear any type of advice Words of encouragement were often transformed midair into little daggers that somehow made me feel worse instead of better On top of struggling with a major progression of my rheumatoid arthritis I was also having a difficult time accepting the full extent of my depression And as is often the case with depression my mind was constantly tricking itself into believing that I was more comfortable staying where I was than trying to dig myself out of the emotional hole that I was in Too difficult not possible and I can t were phrases that all too often floated around in my head So when helping hands were offered I often found it much easier to snap at them I don t need help I can help myself So true yet so false at the same time I could help myself but I would need help in doing so I started seeking the help that I needed 
For Christmas My Dad gave me some money so I bought a full size basketball net I have been practising it nearly everyday and I can throw the ball a bit further now and more accurate Next Topic is my hoodies I always wear my hood for protection ( I feel safer when i wear it ) apart from in shops where they will tell me to take it off again So If people saw me in the street they would think Im a hoody who is going to get them but people who know me know different I need to try and take off my hood more often thanks for reading bye 
I enjoy good memoirs At their best they can give you a sense of what it would be like to lead a different life to walk in another 's shoes Political memoirs are usually a disappointment as the writers typically have an agenda such as establishing a place in history or angling for the next job They seem more like spin than truthful self-assessment Memoirs by nerdy academics rare as they are are among my favorite in part because I can easily see myself in them and in part because the authors are often brutally honest All this is a prelude to a book recommendation My Life as a Quant Reflections on Physics and Finance by Emanuel Derman I have never been a physicist or worked on Wall Street but this book gives a good sense of what both career paths are like The book was written by the way before the recent financial crisis As a result one does not get a sense of how the author would put recent events into perspective But by the end of the book the author is skeptical enough about the use and abuse of financial models that I suspect he would not be terribly surprised when they went awry 
I ve noticed lately that as they age the one really noticeable place people gain weight is in the face Even athletes whose job it is to stay in impeccable shape Just look at Tony Perez 's Super Veterans card in 1983 Topps he almost looks like two different people I bring this up because the more I look back through all these cards of Fred McGriff the more it appears that he didn t gain face weight Can that be right His helmet looked comically oversized even late into his career ( whereas someone like Tony Gwynn filled out under his helmet ) It 's always shocking when you see an old retired athlete ( take Larry Bird for example ) because usually the first thing you think of is Hey he really let himself go And yet take a look at this photo from a dinner in 2007 McGriff doesn t look like Rickey Henderson but he also doesn t look like he stopped working out occasionally Anyway I didn t really want to talk about face fat I wanted to talk about good old National Packtime Take a look at the lineup of this little set from 1995 Alex Rodriguez Barry Bonds Cal Ripken Ken Griffey Jr Tony Gwynn Frank Thomas Mike Piazza Will Clark Juan Gonzalez Jeff Bagwell Kenny Lofton Fred McGriff Deion Sanders Matt Williams Jose Canseco Bob Hamelin Tim Salmon Raul Mondesi You know for all the future Hall of Famers and on-the-cusp guys in the set the guy I was most excited by was Raul Mondesi (Y ou want to read something interesting Read Mondesi 's wikipedia page ) I still feel like Mondesi could if he wanted to get back into playing shape and make an impact on a team like Pittsburgh or Seattle And I bet that with a few rigorous workouts that face fat will leather itself taut (S croll down to the bottom of this page to see what Mondesi looks like now ) 
Occasionally there is no question that the couple is moving toward divorce but know it will take some time to work everything out If their incomes are substantially different it may be worth agreeing on a written separation agreement that way the person paying any alimony can deduct it on his or her tax return The paying spouse might be able to pay the receiving spouse more than enough to pay the tax on the alimony and still come out ahead Sometimes one of the spouses has a religious objection to divorce A formal separation will allow the spouses to remain officially married even as they live separate lives 
In Thailand when the captain of a boat says the weather is too dangerous to carry on he starts laughing Thats when I started worrying Thailand 's coast was far away behind us and the nearest real land was Burma to our Starboard - which is on the righthand side for you landlubbers A looming grey cloud piled up over Burma and another storm was rolling in from the sea ahead which is the Fore Or the Stern But it didn t matter right now as the captain was looking very stern himself 
There are also many reasons why people stay together even though they know that they should really end the relationship Sometimes one partner makes the other feel guilty about leaving and manipulates them into staying in the relationship If you feel within your heart that the relationship is over then you should do what 's right for you without any feelings of guilt about the relationship 
Alongside work I spent time with my old host family and other friends both volunteers and not I had Chinese food tasty beer and hot running water But it was at home relaxing with my family back in Naryn that I was truly caught off guard Upon inspection of a persistent scratching in my luggage I found a mouse had made a home in an old deodorant tube with my toilet paper rations and was living quite happily off of my emergency Cliff Bars As a testament to that company folks he sure was hard to catch 
Packed into a small minivan I exchanged uncomfortable looks with 10 other foreign tourists as we sped away from the train station and glided easily onto Singapore 's well oiled highway The cute girl in the station helpfully offered advice on a free bus service to the Singapore Zoo A few minutes later I was paying a complete stranger money for an entrance ticket to the Night Safari in exchange for a free ride You don t have a sign on the van man a young pseudo backpacker announced from the sidewalk His mother looked uncomfortable You guys are getting ripped off he yelled as the door slammed shut and we sped away 
I grew up in Oxfordshire England From 1995 - 1997 ( age 11 - 13 ) my father worked in Oman and I spent around 8 months there visiting him Until 1970 the country had been ruled by a Sultan who banned anything modern or Western from roads to electricity to medecine to spectacles By the time I got there most of it was only accessible by terrible dirt tracks and we spent much of our free time exploring the rugged interior by 4WD on foot and even by camel Experiences such as being invited into a one-room mud hut in an isolated mountain village and visiting a Bedouin camel market on the edge of the desert left an indelible impression on me and a thirst for more exotica 
yes I believe it is because us guys have Testosterone which makes us more active and so we burn off fat by eating and exercising I was really skinny as a kid because I could go play until I finished my food so shoveled my food so I could play and I burned off the food before it had time to become fat 
I lost my mother to radical breast cancer which kept spreading throughout her body She had five different operations and chemo therapy before she died I just had radical prostate surgery a week ago Tuesday and today found out there is a 30 % chance there is still some left but need to wait 6 weeks to see where we are I have high hopes as I have 3 gran aughters and 1 grandson who are very concerned We are keeping them informed and positive I hope this is what you are looking for 
I certainly hope AIPAC comes to its senses soon But I suspect it wants a showdown with the Obama Administration which unlike its Bush predecessor has stood with the rest of the world in requesting that Israel adhere to Road Map laid out by the so-called quartet ( the U S E U U N and Russia ) a plan the West Bank Palestinians seem to be taking seriously This is an attempt by AIPAC to show muscle and force the Obama Administration to back down Israel has tremendous support in the United States especially among Evangelicals ( who believe that the achievement of a Greater Israel--that is the annexation of Palestinian lands--would be a precursor of the Rapture ) 
Just like people some dogs have a sensitive stomach or will even vomit on an empty stomach As long as the dog is eating drinking acting normally exhibiting no other signs of illness and showing no increase in frequency of the vomiting there is typically no reason to worry Always consult your vet if your dog 's vomiting is chronic continues for more than a day or is accompanied by other symptoms such as weight loss decreased appetite diarrhea or excessive water intake 
If your ex-spouse keeps throwing up roadblocks to your recovery or the recovery of your children you re probably about to lose your mind Believe it or not more often than not the roadblocks are either unintentional or unconscious if not both 
But listening only goes so far when you re trying to work out problems in you relationship If you do not really understand where they are coming from you might be creating more problems When they are expressing themselves you want to ask questions when appropriate in order to clarify what they are saying to you Even if it seems uncomfortable at first it 's important that you make sure that you understand where they are at and how you might be able to help 
Even after years of working with divorcees I am amazed at how often one party sets themselves up for conflict with their approach It is very easy to put the other person on the defensive with your words or tone No one wants to be wrong in divorce In fact admitting that your wrong would suggest weakness and the divorce system is not set up to tolerate weakness from anyone So you should not expect your ex to admit he or she is wrong bad difficult stupid or any other negative quality 
Kosovo maintains a border station into Serbia while Serbia maintains a police checkpoint a few kilometers later to catch visa violators If you entered Kosovo first received a Kosovar entry and exit stamp and then try to enter Serbia you will be denied access Good luck finding your way back to Pristina Serbia considers Kosovo a part of Serbian territory and if you enter it without a Serbian entry visa you are technically without a valid visa As a matter of principle Serbian visa stamps are not available along the Kosovar / Serbian border as there are only police checkpoints to make sure you have one 
The problem with universal health care is there inevitably becomes a huge backlog of patients waiting for surgery to be approved and there is the tendancy to use less expensive methods of treatment which can and often does does nothing for the patient ( cancer treatments heart hiv / aids etc ) 
While you don t have to become legally separated to do this taking time away from each other is one of the best ways to stop a marriage from becoming a divorced marriage When you take time away from each other you allow yourself to have a new perspective on the events that are happening And this can allow you to see new solutions as well as new ideas for how to handle the problems that you may be having Even if it 's just a night or a few hours taking time to step back from an issue can help it become easier to resolve 
One of the best ways to help save your marriage is to start creating long term plans with your partner While this might not seem like the best idea at the time it will create the idea that you are both going to make it through the rough patch that you have stumbled upon - somehow Try to make plans for vacations or other far in the future appointments This will create a little less pressure because the future isn t so vague and unable to be seen in the dark that you are experiencing at the time 
Don t expect to put chemicals in your body and expect to stay healthy There 's enough chemicals in the air and in the water as it is Remember we re living in a chemical world of industrialization and profit If you want to help clean your body try some prunes or lots of watermelon it tastes good or load up on live digestive enzymes 
Michael Scherer tells me that Obama aides expect that the president will meet with Senate and House Dems at some point this week Not sure where or when -- I just put it in here as there was nothing else going on Wednesday and it seemed the most likely date 
There 's nothing more damaging to a relationship than a partner that doesn t take the time to listen In fact that fact alone might be the thing that has led to the feelings of dissatisfaction with a marriage In order to be a good partner ( on either end ) you need to be able to remain quiet and talk through problems until both partners are satisfied Be quiet when they are speaking and try to really listen to what they are saying 
C-SPAN junkies rejoice -- the indispensable cable chroniclers have put just about every minute they ve ever recorded online with full search functionality That 's 160 000 + hours going back more than 20 years Though it will surely be a useful tool for studying history and exposing hypocrisy we get the a ed bonus of being able to dig up videos and photos of our colleagues from the early 90s 
While having a quaint town to retreat to after a long day on the slopes is important the main attraction is the skiing itself Bansko boasts modern lifts and facilities ( rare in the region ) and has a wide range of trails that will keep beginners to experts happy A fresh blanket of powder awaited us on our first day which proved nicer conditions than our trip to the Dolomites in Italy Though to be fair the selection of rental equipment is not friendly to the advanced skier Bring your own if you are picky 
We were on holiday recently and my partner was navigating It was dark and she wasn t really sure of where we were or how to get to our destination On several occasions I was tempted to ridicule her efforts to find her way and laugh outright at her method of navigating 
Long ago are the dates that began at the fanciest restaurant in town and ended with a balcony seat at the opera As society becomes more budget-minded and people struggle to get out of debt from credits cards mortgages and school loans there lies a need for frugal alternatives to the romantic date Short of forcing your date to eat your leftover pizza from last night and watching a re-run of a sitcom what other budget-minded options are out there 
Our Cancer will be a new experience for many of you so we realize it may take some practice Feel free to post comments to the blog if you have any questions on how it works and we ll do our best to help you out Meanwhile we encourage you to start discussions on things you care about You re the experts in your own experiences in Cancer World so we re hoping you ll take the lead in sharing your stories so others can benefit from your wisdom 
While you might be upset about the way that things have turned out you need to remember that being calm is the best way to see things more clearly Try lowering your voice when you talk - it automatically lowers your blood pressure and your anger Try to take a few deep breaths before you say anything - this will help you to be clear and calm as you speak Many people perceive becoming flustered or upset as being angry and that can lead to a poor environment for working through issues 
Beyond that there may not be much of a reason to go through the time pain and expense of a formal legal separation Better perhaps to agree to reach a working arrangement for an informal separation You can then follow it up directly with either reconciliation or divorce So can separation save a marriage - that is the question Some people strenuously resist separation thus a ing even more stress into an already tense marriage Perhaps separation may be the best option for some marriages despite the looming shadow of divorce as living together is obviously is not working However can you make it work from a distance A trial separation will go a long way in helping you decide the answer 
There should be caps put into place on the Doctors Hospitals and Pharmaceuticals for what they can charge Maybe the government should put a stop to the AMA and the Pharmaceutical companies from using a lot of their money and influence for lobbying in D C in order to keep the prices practically out of reach for the average American It is becoming increasingly ridiculous in this country that our government is practically allowing corporate America to intentionally get away with breaking the finances of the working class American 
My own personal is opinion is that the health care system is about how can make the most money Health care insurance prescriptions nursing homes are costing more and more every year and if you are lucky enough to have insurance the coverage is decreasing What we need to do is start thinking about our citizens and not the bottom line Many problems in this country stems from health care We need to make insurance affordable for employers so they can make it affordable for their employees One idea I like is being able to bank money that would initially go to insurance if you was to need it but if you don t use it would work like a savings account There is alot of problems with health care and many other things in this country and hopefully the next person in charge of these problems will be able to conduct a plan that thinks about the mi le class and the poor and not the rich lobbiest and drug companies 
I don t care how good your relationship is with your ex-spouse with few exceptions there are going to be periods of time when you just don t see eye to eye And you know what That 's a normal part of the process and if you agreed on everything you probably wouldn t have split up in the first place But that 's a topic for another time 
I 'm so glad I didn t She did find her way eventually and I had a fantastic time on my surprise weekend away She even apologised ( after some time had passed ) for the lengthy detour I guarantee that none of that would have happened if I d made her feel stupid 
The America-Israel Public Affairs Committee ( AIPAC ) has done a very unwise thing It has issued a statement criticizing the Obama Administration rather than Israel for its reaction to the Netanyahu government 's recent announcement of more illegal settlement blocks in East Jerusalem--an announcement that was made during Vice President Joe Biden 's visit last week an act of extreme rudeness on top of its unquestioned illegality 
The new Our Cancer community has been live for less than 24 hours and I 'm happy to report that people are beginning to use it As of this morning around 50 of you have joined the group and a number of you have started posting introductions about yourselves 
Any veteran observer of Congress is used to the rampant hypocrisy over the use of parliamentary procedures that shifts totally from one side to the other as a majority moves to minority status and vice versa But I can t recall a level of feigned indignation nearly as great as what we are seeing now from congressional Republicans and their acolytes at the Wall Street Journal and on blogs talk radio and cable news It reached a ridiculous level of misinformation and disinformation over the use of reconciliation and now threatens to top that level over the projected use of a self-executing rule by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi In the last Congress that Republicans controlled from 2005 to 2006 Rules Committee Chairman David Dreier used the self-executing rule more than 35 times and was no stranger to the concept of deem and pass That strategy then decried by the House Democrats who are now using it and now being called unconstitutional by WSJ editorialists was defended by House Republicans in court ( and upheld ) Dreier used it for a 40 billion deficit reduction package so that his fellow GOPers could avoid an embarrassing vote on immigration I don t like self-executing rules by either party I prefer the regular order so I am not going to say this is a great idea by the Democrats But even so is there no shame anymore 
Bleach is a form of chlorine and sodium hydroxide ( lye water ) These two substances will kill your intestinal flora that is 3 /4 of your immune system Just drinking chlorinated tap water or even worse fluoridated tap water you will greatly harm your immune system It will have the opposite effect of what you are trying to do Allopathic medicine has put us all in great harm by following the kill the germ idea to make us healthy To properly cleanse your body you should find a good certified nutritional therapist that understands QRA to help you 
In April 2008 I quit my job sold most of my belongings and left on a world trip - and never looked back Starting in Berlin ( Germany ) and heading east time will tell where my journey eventually leads me If you like what you see and want to receive an email whenever I a a new blog entry simply subscribe to this blog I hope you enjoy my stories as much as I enjoy my journey Any feedback (p ublic comment on any blog entry or private message ) is always much appreciated and makes the blog special to me 
Singapore is a gastronomic paradise to suit any budget In a city that can quickly put pressure on your wallet from accommodation to shopping food is the one area where you can splurge for cheap Throughout the city street stalls have been collected and thrown together into outside eateries offering Chinese Indian Singaporean ( whatever that means ) and general Southeast Asian fare Or you can head down to the Muslim district and eat Murtabak Prata in one of the many shops 
Day 308 - Cradle Valley to Devonport Crikey who flew us back to the UK without us knowing It 's flipping blinking freezing here this morning Brrrrrgggggghhhhhhh Even a hot shower doesn t manage to warm the cockles but it 's not windy like it was yesterday so that 's a blessing Hopefully everyone out on the Overland Track will be snug from thermal clothing if nothing else Today is our last day with Tony Jane in Tasmania anyway They don t leave the state until Wednesday night but we re catching a ferry back to the mainland in the morning so are heading back 
You may be questioning why I even bothered to go back to Singapore at all This time I was routed through Singapore to wait for a visa while on a work trip to Timor-Leste and then Sri Lanka As you can see I have a bias for rougher countries but I was determined to make the best of my work funded stopover As a result I give you my short list to making Singapore an interesting place 
Thoughts of self survival were in my mind so I eyed up the crew onboard for possible cannibalistic mealtimes The old-time hippy guy who i chatted to earlier had annoyed me with his insight that the island was busy now too many visitors and the locals just rip people off but I figured that his island knowledge would be useful Plus the three chunky German girls with sarongs sunburn and supersized rucksacks looked promising - definitely more meat on them than the vegetarian hippy 
The two-calendar-day reporting time expires and the Rules Committee can take up the bill Traditionally a rule takes one calendar day to ripen but past leaders both Republican and Democrat have gotten around that by including in the rule a provision that essentially declares that same day a whole new day ( yes this is White Rabbit time they d be observing ) If Speaker Pelosi chooses to she can bring up the vote Thursday but again she ll need time to whip members so a vote on Friday or Saturday is more likely 
When you visit Our Cancer for the first time you ll find some things that are familiar but largely it will be a new experience for most of you Up until now we ve interacted through the blog which meant that Leroy or Laurie would write a post and then the rest of us would respond having a conversation in the comment threads With Our Cancer things will be different as all of you will be able to start your own conversations Each one of you will be able to post blog entries and start discussion threads You can even upload a photo or video clip and have people discuss it or share an event listing with everyone If you ve ever used Facebook it 's kind of like what 's known there as a Facebook Group It 's a place where all of us can take the lead and begin conversations that are important to us 
The Night Safari is something special Showcasing nocturnal animals that sleep during normal zoo daytime hours the dense humid surrounding jungle pulls you right into the safari experience Take a train or walk the various paths past tigers rhinos deer flying squirrels and hundreds of others 
As i was considering that Germany has had its fair share of cannibals recently and so maybe the German girls may know some good recipes the boat steered toward the mangrove trees and amazingly a small channel opened up in them - a gap barely wider than the boat was long and stu ed with brown decaying teeth of rocks that were gnashing at us foaming the water and making me feel like this island was laughing at us Evilly 
We turned to the left or Port side for land which was a useless phrase right now as there was no port just a bay of rocks mangrove and the thick jungle of the tip of Koh Chang 
If you have children then this becomes an a itional dimension to consider It 's generally better for children to grow-up in a family with their parents in the same house The exception to this is when there 's an environment of abuse danger or emotional stress Before you decide to walk out on your wife and kids consider the children and whether it 's possible to resolve your differences Only if that 's absolutely impossible and the family environment is worse if you stay together than if you split up should you even consider leaving 
In a healthy relationship we are always doing kind and thoughtful gestures for our partner or spouse It may be making them a cup of tea in the morning leaving the heater on in the bathroom running an errand or picking up the dry cleaning The list is endless and I encourage you to take some time to think of the kind and thoughtful gestures your special someone does for you as they are often overlooked and go un-thanked By taking some time to notice the things they do you can easily rectify this with a thank you a hug or some other acknowledgement 
Why Because couples who separate tend to find that without the constant daily conflict and bickering the lack of proximity to their spouse provides time to think and solve problems Marital problems are often hard to resolve as they often get stalled by egos fear and stubbornness Resolution can flourish as long as at least one partner is willing to keep trying if the urge to always be right and not back down remains then it probably means that the separation will end in divorce 
Another issue is the distance to the slopes from the center of town While having the slopes at the higher altitudes does wonders for the snow conditions access is a big problem Only one gondola ferries skiers to the beginning of the slopes and the traffic jams are intense Be prepared to fight your way into the cars As we were putting our skies in the outside holders two others snuck in before us After waiting in line for an hour we weren t impressed with the local hospitality The gondola opens at 8 30 am so if you don t want to wait for an hour or longer get there early and bring some muscle 
Make it more accessible for people so they do not have to lie about their situation For example an unmarried pregnant female has a nice car nice appt and is in school but her job is a private nanny and therefor has no health insurance In order for her to receive health care she would have to sell her car and downgrade her appt before she can be accepted 
In Autumn 2007 I moved to Russia and began teaching English Working crazy hours for good pay I was able to save up enough money after 9 months to travel for a year The beginning of that year is where this blog begins After that year of traveling I returned to Russia where I am now to do the same thing again 
Between snow-melt and rain Bishkek was a grim portent of what spring will be like in Naryn whenever it finally decides to come Mud mud mud was the name of the game Bishkek has plenty more paved roads than in Sunny Naryn and that bodes poorly for what extremes our mud situation might entail The high mountains of snow excavated from the neighbor 's driveways and yards leaves me fearful as to how my shoes socks and pant-cuffs will survive Thankfully though that trial is still months away 
Every time I travel through Singapore I am disappointed Compared to the surrounding countries Singapore is a bland wasteland of identical shopping malls and artificially created tourist attractions It lacks the gritty cultural depth filling the cracks of its less prosperous neighbors A bold statement Indeed but one backed up by countless uninspiring trips through the small city state For the first time visitor to Asia Singapore is a great stepping stone to getting acclimated to this diverse area of the world But for the experienced Asia hand it can easily turn into an exercise of waiting for the water to boil as the seconds tick by and time stretches out 
The neoconservatives who worship General David Petraeus may not be too pleased with this--a briefing Petraeus prepared for his boss Admiral Mike Mullen on the regional problems being raised by Israel 's instransigence on the settlements issue If Israel were taking a moral position that upset the regional Arabs like defending its right to exist ( a limited strike in self-defense against the Hamas rocketers in Gaza for example ) I d say that Arab disapproval would be a geo-strategic cost that we as Israel 's ally would have to live with 
Hi Sarimah I am watching the show and you did a great job Answering you questions well this is because of the muscle mass that basically guys having higher muscle mass compared to women 1kg of muscle will burns approximately 31 calories ( without exercise ) that we call BMR-Basal Metabolic Rate More muscle means more fat burnt The second things is during exercising guys will use more energy than women does Says weight lifting Guys can bring up 30KG weight but women maybe 10KG Means that guys will burn more calories because they use more energy compared to women 
I find it striking that so many people have answered yes followed with because men have more muscle mass But WHY do men have more muscle mass It all boils down to hormones Women produce more estrogen than men and what bit men do produce is filtered out via the liver Estrogen is known as the fat storing hormone It 's what gives women hips and breasts and makes our skin soft and smooth Testosterone ( which women DO produce in small amounts ) lends itself to the building UP of muscle mass and the tearing DOWN of fat This is why you see so many female ( well and male ) bodybuilders abusing anabolic steroids Anabolic steroids are a synthetic form of testosterone This abuse not only allows the woman to rid her body of fat quicker ( too much so - most will no longer menstruate due to lack of sufficient body fat - another reason we women produce estrogen ) and also to build up muscle MUCH quicker than at a normal rate The more muscle one has the faster he or she will burn fat even at rest 
Just when I thought I could relax a bit and enjoy the Christmas season I get more bad news For every cancer patient this can happen at the worst of times But for a disease that seems to attack indiscriminately there 's no reason to expect it to honor holidays 
This time it wasn t a complete surprise as I have been experiencing new pain in my lower right back which has been getting steadily worse almost every day Initial scans had shown nothing but my PSA was up again so I knew something was happening When I found out last week that it had quadrupled in 4 weeks it confirmed that the cancer was actively spreading again ( and growing tumours or lesions ) It seems that once it starts up it moves very fast I can only try to slow it down with hormones but I can t use the same ones as before ( which rendered me bed-ri en ) so it will be 's ub-optimal treatment as my oncologist says 
Forgiving infidelity is a difficult choice to make Many people find it easier to disconnect from the cheater and heal alone Forgiving infidelity involves strength and guidance because infidelity often attacks a person 's self esteem Working through feelings of anger hurt and betrayal are essential before the forgiving process can begin There is help available for forgiving infidelity Here are a few tips 
Any universal health care system will have to be two fold Public and private Privately insured and government funded The government funded would have to have some form of bulk billing by doctors and hospitals to keep the overall cost down Services would have to be combined as well wherever possible to prevent double billing ie seeing a GP for a problem then being referred to a specialist then having to return to the GP for further direction And of course no universal health care would be effective unless it included dental coverage as many health problems are related to poor oral care The major drug manufacturing companies have to be on board as well if this were to succeed 
I lost my nanny to cancer when I was in Primary School we were so close She went from being so fit looking after 3 grand children collecting (W ALKING ) them from the primary school every day with me in the pram when all of a su en me and her were shopping when she collapsed I remember that day she was coughing up blood But what was I to do I was like 4 /5/6 I thought nothing of it The rest was a blur but I do have a slight memory of seeing her in Marie Curie She died on New Years Eve / perhaps Day 
So this Christmas will mix friends family and fun with scans doctors and meds These kinds of choices are tough enough but they can certainly cast a pall over a happy season So that 's my challenge - to deal with all of this without letting it ruin my holiday We have a wonderful Christmas season planned with lots of family and friends and while my situation will be on everyone 's minds ( because they love and care for me ) I 'm not going to let it take away from their enjoyment or mine

On Dec 20 we held an exclusive family and friends book launch for The Wolf at my Door Given the time of year I was very pleased to have about 75 people attend My brother and good friend Gayla surprised we with humbling and heartfelt introductions and then I had a chance to read excerpts from the book It was an amazing day and incredibly emotional for everyone who attended Many people read the book over the next couple of days and I have received incredible feedback and requests for more copies Thank you to everyone who attended with a special thanks to my daughter Caralia who arranged the event and to Meghan and Dayna who also helped 
Walk done the road you might find something open We are located in the center of town Wow that was unhelpful The swank interior decorating of bright reds set on black and futuristic minimalistic Japanese inspired lines of the hotel lobby highlighted the staff 's unwillingness to get his image dirty with useful answers This didn t bode well for our stay Luckily we were rescued by a perky eyed staff member who replaced her manager We were pointed in the direction of a local tavern one of many and welcomed despite the late hour 
If you have a portable computer I d recommend using Avast Anti-Virus with Windows Defender ( install by default on Vista Win7 ) Also make sure you keep update date with all system patches by using Windows Update ( if using windows ) or using the updater provided with Mac or Linux You can get ClamAV for Linux I don t really know what you could use for I 'm sure someone else could recommend for Mac :) As for a firewall I just rely on Avast ( Free ) to block intrusions on my laptop normally picks them up well especially with its new silent firewall Both Avast and ClamAV have free versions I like the free Avast as well as it 's not too intrusive in the way that it tries to advertise its paid versions unlike other AVs 
So why I hear you ask would anyone go through a formal legal separation Maybe because some states require that a couple seeking a divorce have been separated for some period of time Also some couples need to remain legally married perhaps so one can continue to be insured for medical or other purposes by the other 's company Formal legal separation makes this possible 
Divorcees are constantly trying to figure out the motives of the other party But too often there is no dialogue about why certain things are being said or done When there is discussion about these things the conversation often falls apart and escalates into an emotional fire storm This can be particularly true in the early days Frankly it can get down right depressing 
Please also take note that I don t mean to offend anyone but merely to share my experiences ( good and bad ) - so please don t get all worked up by my entries - although constructive criticism is of course very welcome indeed Having said that I am not aiming to write a politically correct blog here My writing is ( naturally ) highly subjective and expresses my (s ometimes strong ) opinions Also if you happen to be an American lawyer reading my entries I take absolutely no responsibility whatsoever if someone chooses to somehow act based on any information in my blog 
Here is a simple a tip that can keep you from pulling your hair out Before you approach your ex about a concern write out a script along with possible replies from your ex Then revise your script as many times as you possibly can until you are certain you are not taking an attacking blaming threatening or condescending tone and approach Really put your words to the test Get honest about how you would respond to a similar approach When you are sure you have the best possible script memorize it and give it a go but only when the timing is right 
Taking shelter from the rain we shook ourselves dry underneath a hut and puzzled about where all these people were The tidy simple huts on stilts looked empty apart from the orange clothes hanging outside some of them Monks robes 
I know this will be hard to believe but an overwhelming majority of the divorced parents I ve worked with truly want what 's best for the kids Unfortunately a lot of behavior suggests otherwise But let me remind you that divorce is packed with overwhelming emotion high stress and periods of utter chaos And keep in mind that some people just do not get it when it comes to healthy interaction Not only that some people simply cannot control their anger Combine that with little skill in the communication department and you have a good chance for conflict 
A formal legal separation is more permanent more complicated and more expensive It 's also much less common It 's nearly as expensive as a divorce - sometimes more so because it 's less common - so you may have to pay your lawyer to figure out how to do everything And often people who get a formal legal separation wind up having to go through all the pain time and expense again later to get an actual divorce 
The 72 hours run out from when the bill is posted online Now as to what they ll be voting upon As Kate points out TNR 's Jon Cohn outlined three possibilities on Saturday On Sunday the White House declared its preference for options one or two when White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs declared on Fox News Sunday We ll have the votes when the House votes I think within the next week And I think whoever sits here this time next week you all will be talking about health care reform not as a presidential proposal but as something that will soon be the law of the land In other words they don t want to wait for the Senate to act which would take another week minimum They want President Obama to sign a bill into law before he leaves for Indonesia and Australia this is after all why he postponed his trip So this leaves us with options one and two House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is doing her best to save her members from one a vote directly on the Senate bill as she doesn t want to further burden them with all the Senate sweetheart deals that are going to be stripped out in reconciliation any way Which leaves option No 2 the most likely one House aides told me 
Still the captain smiled but he wasn t blinking and his grin was fixed I 'm not sure who 's teeth were worse but this would be a battle between man and land The waves were still pushing us Beachfront actionaround and rain was punching down from the sky

hey :) Cool questions is this like a test I would say guys probably did lose weight faster then women at a guess This could either be because of some biological reason such as men having more muscle the women thus having higher metabolisms or it could be due to the stereotypical ways in which we train differently In general women shy away from doing weights because the don t want to look manly but lifting weights causes a much higher increase in resting metabolic rate then cardio does So there 's my ill informed answer lol hope it helps in some way :) 
A few people have asked me if Our Cancer is just a new name for the blog so I wanted to explain a bit more Our Cancer is whole new thing that 's a direct offshoot of the blog which you can find at npr org / ourcancer On the blog Leroy or Laurie would write something each day and publish it Then the rest of you would then post a comment as a reply to whatever they wrote It 's a great way to collect responses from people but doesn t make it possible for everyone to start their own conversation 
As the waves approached the bow and all the passengers would lift into the air smashing down the mi le of the boat heavily into the next wave right under dirty old fishing fleet my feet I looked down each time to spot cracks or leaks but by now so much water had blown in or had rained over the side it was hard to spot the signs of a sinking ship We cracked down onto the second wave with the bow facing down and so in the best position for a third wave to crash over and into the boat soaking us all - first time journeymakers and the long-time resident hippies of the islands 
Look we all pick up bad habits around our eating We eat more than required or we watch the TV while eating we eat junk food maybe we re just depressed and don t care and food is a source of comfort - whatever your situation is I can tell you one thing If there is anyone who can help you best it 's yourself Try and use affirmations and visualisation to help you focus on the way you would like to see yourself ideally Learn about the Glycemic Index - you probably don t have a 's weet tooth but are stuck in what 's called the insulin trap which causes you to eat every so often and also is the main contributor to weight gain Set up a good exercise routine - preferably with a bu y who can motivate you and hold you accountable I use GR2 control meal replacement shake as it keeps me feeling full for long and provides a constant source of energy from morning till lunchtime 
Along with abuse it is also important to recognise if your relationship is not only making you miserable but is also robbing your self esteem When you realize that the effects of your relationship are preventing you from enjoying life it is time to step back and re-evaluate your relationship Of course no relationship is perfect and you can expect to have good and bad times but if things have become so negative that you no longer feel good about yourself then the relationship is destructive and needs to end 
Yes Men do typically lose weight faster and easier than women This phenomenon is due to a man 's on average higher metabolism A man 's higher metabolism comes from a typically higher muscle mass and muscle burns more calories Also men are typically larger than women and just maintaining biomass is an increase on calorie demand therefore a calorie burner On the other side of the coin women have other biological goals than men do and that would be to have reserves in order to support the creation development and birth of children as well as provide those children with milk 
Pelosi 's office said the CBO score is now expected Tuesday instead of Monday Once they have a bill Dems need to post it online for at least 72 hours for members to review before a vote They could post this Monday but more likely it ll be Tuesday And it ll probably be continuously tweaked as the bill is examined for potential Byrd Rule challenges CBO scoring conflicts and other rules hiccups This is not a House rule but rather a Democratic caucus pledge one that has been broken in the rush to vote in the past so it 's up to the discretion of the leaders if they want to observe it But given that they need as much time as possible to whip votes it seems likely that the full 72 hours will be observed 
Why start off a rough patch by thinking that it will never get any better no matter what you do When you re trying to work through problems and issues you will want to make sure that you re going into it with a positive attitude You don t need to be sugary sweet but you should start to look at your troubles as learning lessons rather than the doom of the relationship Try to think about happier times when you start to become negative in order to turn your thinking around 
i never meant to go travelling I just went You start moving and can t stop and when you do the inertia swells in your head like sea until the tides take you off again I 'm loving reading other peoples stories on travelblog and find it a really amazing place to research where i want to go in future as well as just hearing normal peoples lives away from the filtered and edited rubbish we are fed by the tourism industry and the cliched travel sections of Sunday newspapers 
His small wooden boat was being lashed with rain and wind Our ferry journey started as a cheerful trip but now we had fallen silent soaked and slightly seasick from the side to side pounding The barefoot captain and his swarthy crew were gripping the oversized longtail motor harder than ever to keep us on track toward the small island outcrop of Koh Chang Noi where two countries meet and tropical storms swell up from the Indian ocean

A trial separation may allow the spouse who wants the divorce to experience some of the feelings of being separated without making a final decision to divorce The main advantage of a trial separation of course is that it 's easily reversible You can try it for a while go through counseling and then reconcile or you can try separation for a while decide you like it - and then proceed with divorce 
This past week has seen a flurry of activity folks if for no other reason than my recent trip down to Bishkek our capital in the warm Chui Valley While up in Naryn we ve endured the ravages of the -30 F cheelde ( which has finally chicked ) and a powerfully battering of snow the weather in Bishkek has been considerably less intense Their winter has been marked by only a little snow a certain amount of rain and temperatures that might surprise you During this trip while we were still below freezing in Naryn daytime temps in Bishkek rose to a granted unseasonably warm 45 degrees 
Many people start to question their own sanity for ever having loved such a beast in the first place And whether you like it or not you need to go back in your head to find that person you did love way back when That can go a long way toward a little bit of reality If the person you married was a good person then they re probably still a good person just not showing it at the moment 
This afternoon the fun will begin with an anticipated Congressional Budget Office score followed by a House Budget Committee markup of the reconciliation amendments that will become the shell that the Senate bill will be a ed to as an amendment Presumably as soon as they re done Chairman Spratt will go to the floor As a privileged piece of legislation he must deliver it directly to the floor where it ll be numbered and reported out Under House rules the report takes two calendar days before it can be referred to the Rules Committee The House Democratic caucus meets as Dems whip for votes

The next morning when Swapna logged in she had forgotten completely about the surprise and they were chatting about random things as the conversation went by Ram did not bother to remind her either Swapna quickly typed We are going to have a huge bash for Anisha 's birthday tomorrow at her place We couldn t have a party that day cos she had plans with her family Ram exclaimed Wow that 's awesome sweety So you are gonna be at her place all day tomorrow eh Swapna giggled to herself and replied Why do you ask like you re going to come to the party )\ Ram sighed heavily on the other side and keyed in How I wish babe how I wish They continued and she went on and on about what she had planned for the party Ram was missing all the action and he felt bad about it Ram typed out in frustration Damn Semester ended yesterday and if only I could afford to get to India :( :( Swapna asked anticipating a positive response Is there no way you can come now Ram made a quick and short reply Nope Swapna was now asking Ram what else they could do Swapna asking him for some ideas for the party Ram said his mood wasn t ok and he logged off Swapna tried to persuade him to stay but he refused and left Swapna was missing him online and she was su enly reminded of the surprise that he had promised She was now very curious to know what it was and she called him The conversation was very terse Ram answered the call and in a very depressed tone replied I will call you tomorrow I know you were reminded of the surprise I promised you I ll let you know tomorrow Waiting at times increases the value of the surprise Hold on to your curiosity sweety Without waiting for her to reply he hung up

Been months since i logged into wordpress So what was keeping me busy Well a lot of things Work got tighter on and off forcing to stretch for project deliveries But a lot of other activities also took my time Playing TT at office in the evenings was a great exercise and stress buster I typed the above sometime in July and i stopped it and didnt publish that time So what else is keeping me going Justifying that i was busy at work all along the year will be a lie though it can attribute to 50 % So what are the other acitivities that i did Apart from work been doing quite few things that bring in some satisfaction Be it hanging around with busroutes in guys and making some tiny contribution in python / php / testing or literally roaming around the streets for mapping e-city / hosur or attending the Wikipedia Meetup 3 and getting hooked into it or making my first article appear on the DYK section of the main page or participating in Wikipedia takes Chennai it was all pure fun and learning Came across a bunch of awesome people in the process of doing these things Been to college couple of times during the alumni meet and then for software freedom day it was just refreshing to breathe the old air So stressed office schedules + Parallel activities like above + travelling home twice a month leaves no time for blogging I have been tweeting heavily though for quite sometime now Follow me there Hope i will update this blog soon and will not keep it idle for a year

Chiputu is how i call this thin frame if i dont call him Hari Some of the things that comes to my mind when i think about him 1 He is always seen doing bowling actions at home 2 Always on phone 3 A mini google - I dont know how he gathers information about someone But he seem to know everyone and about everyone :) 4 Positive guy 5 Cannot drive a two wheeler with gears (S orry Hari ) The only thing i dont like about him is the fact that he likes the actor Vijay I am new to Orkut and hence dont know if i can come back and a few more sentences about him If not i will conclude saying that he is a sweet chap and a great friend

I sailed into the gymnasium with forced enthusiasm and despite the few o muscle catches that occurred by the end of my two hours there was a definite sense of improved condition The bounce came back the heat of the morning sun on the lawn was welcomed and the entire day has been spent in spasmless wonder I wore a new dress I changed my watch I wore a pair of shoes that had been ignored for long I attended to my car repair personally While driving to Jalsa I reprimanded a traffic offender I sang along with the FM radio jock as one of my favorites belted itself out from the speakers on the car I checked the electricals in the house that were giving us a problem I unpacked and laid out the various gifts presented to me from the Oman Excellencies I fixed my computer discovering during the course that I had been using the wrong cable box for my internet connection I made calls to people that I had been avoiding for sometime And I watched the IPL with great delight

Interest in Norton 's take on things and any reference to him returning becomes a major conversation and I hope Marvel pays attention to all of that energy being spent I think it 's really Marvel 's decision at this point not Norton 's and Marvel will make it a priority if they are told loud and clear This is a priority They could easily write around Norton or replace him but I think that would be a creative misstep When you have a collaborator who is this smart and this willing you shouldn t walk away You should embrace them even if that means doing some difficult things and making some choices that cede some power Marvel is being incredibly smart about the films they control these days and they have a chance to line up a truly great cast when the Avengers assemble 
Yesterday i was sitting and waiting for few friends in a Chinese restaurant Waiting is the annoying thing I happen to do very often since I am always ahead of time So now my friends are partially to be blamed for my habit I end up catching a conversation between a 40 something year old man and a 12 to 14 year old boy The book I was trying to read was bad anyway I heard the dad asking his son about school and friends That grabbed my attention The son patiently answered like he really wanted to share How many teenagers do that ( Not like i am the 40 year old dad ) Then the topic turned to women Father asked if the son liked anyone in school The son just giggled I wanted to pull that kid 's cheeks Now lets just focus on non creepy side of me

IT 's the people whom you call at 3 in the morning that matter we ll that 's kind of mundane for us we ve done that day in and day out (d igital systemes ) being the star attraction nature has no love for solitude and always leans as it were on some support and the sweetest support is found in the most intimate friendship ACHU the man always been there for me One of the most level headed guys one can come across and ya ya basketball studies sincerity hardwork movies this guy qualifie 's in superlatives in all these ACHU the best best friend candidate who 's got a heart of gold and a sane head on his shoulders couldnt have asked for a better bu y Even though we might change and we might part finding our own places in the world we all know that when the tears fall or the smile spreads across our face we ll come to each other because no matter where this crazy world takes us nothing will ever change so much to the point where we re not all still friends 
We believe that while investments in ERP will continue many large businesses are buying a itional user-licences and modules as they expand their operations and networks Says Ravi Kathuria Director Marketing and Solutions SSA Global India We find a good percentage ( over 50 percent ) of our business coming from repeat orders from these large enterprises in the form of a itional user-licences and functionality modules including HR and payroll This is because their transactions have grown along with capacities and sales 
Shiv Gaad the biggest flirt I know besides me of course I like one thing about this dude - He is a hedonist He is always looking out to have fun So if you are with him chances are you will have fun too ( even more so if you are a girl )) He is a little bit of a wannabe but certainly tolerable Btw if you are not friends with Shiv yet you should want to become friends with him since I feel Shiv is great with people whom he is just getting to know He will ignore you after he knows you well enough - ) ( the latter is not true but the former is ) 
No I am not going to write about what I think of God But I am going to talk about the gods hanging on our walls Everyone has a calendar to give you at the beginning of the new year which has the most beautiful of god pictures on them So you find it cute get it home put it on your desk hang it on the wall After a year when it has collected dust ( ok maybe yours does not mine does ) and has faded what do you do about it

I also wish you a fiscally successful personally fulfilling and medically uncomplicated recognition of the onset of the generally accepted calendar year 2010 but not without due respect for the calendars of choice of other cultures whose contributions to society have helped make our country great ( not to imply that India is necessarily greater than any other country ) and without regard to the race creed color age physical ability religious faith or sexual preference of the wishee 
Make sure you utilize all the company contribution For example if the company is matching contribution 100 % for the first 1 % and 50 % for 5 % of your contribution choose your contribution to be 6 % at the very least If conditions favor choose maximum contribution allowed by IRS 15 500 for 2007 This will increase by 500 for the next few years as per a law passed in the congress 
Ok so a lesson has been learnt Never talk too soon Talked yesterday on how positivity had changed my condition and how fantastic I was feeling hmm rubbish Nothing worked today Ha The pain was back gym was a torture and an entire day spent in lamenting the uselessness of life Nothing to discourage readers or to deflate their enthusiastic reactions to yesterdays blog but ya just feel when you talk about it it does not work Better to do than to open your mouth about it Many would disagree though Not speaking up a sign of weakness they would proclaim But in this instance I would rather go with what I have generally felt We must do others to talk on what we do And its not important that what we do is talked about So long as the reason for what we do are taken in beneficially to the person for whom we do Cause and reason should know Not who contributed to the cause or reason Better this way

It has been our pleasure to have Collection Services Inc taking care of our bad debt collections for over 20 years On more than one occasion we have measured CSI 's results against other agencies CSI has consistently delivered excellent results Another area that sets CSI apart from others is their customer service They have a proven record of collecting bad debt while treating our patients with respect In the very few instances that we have received negative feedback about CSI from one of our patients CSI 's response and resolution has always been immediate and professional Rarely does a vendor understand and remain so committed to such a mutually beneficial relationship CSI operates as a true partner CSI also provides reports through their website and they are always able to accommodate any of our requests for special information in a timely manner 
John really you and Shankar have driven these change improvement initiatives by identifying critical business needs So I greatly appreciate both of you having the passion drive and interest to continuously improve our IT operations in the Rice Building Now the harder part is actually delivering results and implementing high-impact solutions for our stakeholders -- Jim Prof Shanley Mary Shari Rita etc so that they can recognize the decision and efforts were worthwhile

I agree No one has the right to tell you what to do how to do things Anything we do or say ppl will criticize What you do right might be wrong to someone else hence criticism is constantly alive I would channel those criticize into positive advice and keep your ear opens Don t shut out these criticism Criticism is a way of seeing yourself in a different perspective And I feel twitter blogging has given the celebrities (s ingers actors ) a whole new medium to connect to their fans I 'm glad they are doing it Because I wouldn t be able to praise Shahrukh Khan about his latest movie if it wasn t for him being in Twitter or I wouldn t be able to tell you how much I loved your O Aiiye 's ong from Ayan 
Everyone 's in shock over what happened to the Lankan team None more so than the Taliban / LeT They are utterly shocked that the rest of us assumed sportsmen would not be targeted This was after the Lankan team was promised President-level security Really If this is the protection President-level security gets you I don t blame Zardari for signing that pre-emptive deal with the Taliban No more sports in the country If it 's any consolation Pakistan can continue playing mind games with India and double-games with the US Yep A call intercepted by the CIA confirmed that the Pakistani military is still actively supporting the Taliban So Pakistan is happily absorbing billions in free aid whilst merely pretending to help America in return Kinda like AIG when you think about it It 's been 2 days and no real leads Zardari has assured everyone that the state is the doing the best it can Sure but no resignations None so far Shivraj Patil was not reachable for comment 
62 years have paused and many teams have been formed and yet the congress cannot even think of a democratic set up as yet Performance if you measure in terms of increase in the growth of BPL families over these period is no solace either Neither can you boast of a free and fair society when the terror is lurking on your head at any moment and the economic growth that is being tomtomed is confined only to a few business houses growing richer and richer while the divide between the haves and have-nots is growing wider Whereas you are questioning the new team of BJP where there is atleast the democracy at its root Please give them the breathing time and then judge their performance rather than anticipating miracles overnight 
Shaggy as i would like u to him is one i would easily compare with one of my greatest friends let me tell you he knows how to be himself though he tends to break up sometimes he has been there as my locker mostly cool and calm you ll not realise he 's there with u untill he breaks his silence with his good mokais he pretty much knows everything abt me and wow a great dude to hang out with macha u rock and almost forgot to tell u ppl we share the twin passion BIKES and SPEED roll on bu y

Sri Lanka 's cricket history is replete with fast bowlers both in the pre-Test era and after but they have never produced anyone of genuine pace although many believe DS Jayasundera a right-arm fast bowler in the 1930s and 40s was genuinely sharp and there have been none faster since 
Sometimes I can t help but feel that it 's a Truman show happening here for me at Moscow Wake up at the same time have the same breakfast ( not too many veg options ) - infact when I call Room service the lady says Oh yes sir I know what you ll have for breakfast have a pick up taxi at 11 ( most of the times its the same taxi driver ) pass by the hotel receptionist who says the customary Good morning try to engage in some conversation with the taxi driver keep looking out of the taxi window trying to identify the way ( though we always take the same route I always tend to find it new everyday ) say hi to the russian colleagues go for lunch at 15h00 sharp and have the same dish ( again very few veggie options ) try to engage in conversations with the russians colleagues have a taxi back at 8 hot shower in the evening have the same dinner ( no more mentioning about the kinda food I get ) watch CNN and eurosport ( watch the Sheffield Snooker championship ) on TV ( only english channels ) till about 12 in the night and hit the bed - AND this over and again for 5 consecutive days Woah - the story of my life in the past week 
There are many things that I missed posting when I was back in India One among them is this post Being in SSN the rules and restrictions of other similar colleges seemed so weird When one would talk about the rules and restrictions of such colleges I have often thought that it is either a rumour or an exaggeration One of such rules that you may see is the formal dress code of engineering colleges Such rules exist in most colleges Some of certain rules are wearing absolute formal dress like pants and tucked in shirts If that is not enough some restrictions are also imposed One of the worst cases would be asking the students to wear only light colored shirts and asking them not to wear black Few of my friends happened to go to one of the college to distribute promotional posters of our department symposiums and they had happened to go to such college by wearing a tee shirt and jeans One of the security guards didn t let them go until they proved that they were students from other college There is also an instance I heard that the security guard didn t let one person with a tee shirt to enter the college and that person ended to be the father of a student studying in that college There is one rule that exists that gives you a glance of the upper limit of stupidity of engineering colleges That is the rule of asking boys to not speak to girls and vice versa 
hmmmm this guys ma friend for almost a year now whenever we meet a guy whos jus like us we feel this guy is the rit person to share fun emotions and everythin n this guys one of them a very cool exciting always active stupid DAWG ma best friend mama and evthin lol Hey nee gethuu macha ( he told me to write all this ) :p 
I guess I am little late in wishing you all a Happy Pongal but yet the festival season isn t over yet So I wish you all a Happy Pongal and a Happy Tamil New Year as well I guess I am late in posting the first post this year too It is pretty surprising that I am into my fifth year of my blogging The journey continues As far as my blogging goes it goes pretty slowly at the moment But it seems just like last month I stepped into SSN College of Engineering Now I am just a part of the SSN alumni Last week they had conducted a wonderful tribute to the SSN alumni and I really appreciate that even though missing it by thousands of miles Every year we look into the rest with a new hope trying to build a future that has been carved perfectly in our minds We try to recreate that model Sometimes we fail but sometimes we win Some people drive with the hope of winning Some drive with the fear of losing The former is preferred as when driving a car you go with the intention to go to the destination safely and you don t drive with the fear of crashing Again Safety is a weird word and I need to use it carefully Safety is closely associated with fear and it is contradicting my opinion The positive hope is what drives us forward but at the same time we need to have a small touch of fear that helps us defend ourselves to whatever obstacles we are facing on the journey ahead 
Achu hmmm first thing that comes to mind is discipline ( he is always late by ten to fifteen mins for any work ) sincere ( this is not restricted just to studies ) hardworking he is jst loves burning the midnight oil and makes sure the other guy ( it was me back in school ) also loses sleep 4ams were a routine beach movies football basketball tv pc games Mcrennet zeta jones 411 if i can recollect r some of his fav pasttimes and hangouts and now he has a bike so imagine and yet he finds time to study i feel sad tht v dint end up in the same coll he has his own principles and his own ways of doing things and one has to respect him for tht when im down i do get some advice from him very trustworthy and reliable im sure he will make it big in the future finally bcos ur name appears first in my cell contacts and Y messenger list ( as it is for others ) guys mistake it for some girl 's and i get to be a bit popular and maintain some level of gethu one good reason to remain ur friend - )

Matthew Vaughn 's Kick-Ass isn t going to be in theaters for over a month but it premiered last night at the 2010 South by Southwest Film Festival to huge success When ComingSoon net / SuperHeroHype spoke with the movie 's stars Aaron Johnson and Christopher Mintz-Plasse we weren t too surprised to learn there 's already talk about a Kick-Ass 2 at least in terms of a second volume from creators Mark Millar and John Romita Jr We ll have a full review soon but what 's interesting about Vaughn 's movie is that it starts and ends almost exactly like the first 8-issue volume of the comic series so it essentially leaves Vaughn in a place where he could take what Millar and Romita do in a second volume and adapt it directly onto the big screen as a sequel

New Zealand batsman Brendon McCullum is keen to put the lessons learned from a difficult 2009 IPL into practice during this year 's tournament McCullum is in the mi le of a home series against Australia New Zealand lost the Chapell-Hadlee series 3-2 and the teams will meet in Wellington on Friday for the first of two Test matches With the 2010 IPL successfully underway amongst security fears McCullum is still waiting on clearance before confirming his involvement but was eager to participate in the competition because of its massive impact on the cricketing world

The last few days have been an emotional rollercoaster for the team behind the show The producer of the show Roshni Menon died twenty days before the opening night leaving them completely shocked and shattered Until they realised that the best tribute they could give their friend was make her dream come true We had the first audition on the first weekend of November and had a callback in the second weekend and started rehearsals by the third week But before the rehearsals I spoke to Shaun Roberts to get the music ready and Mike ( Michael Muthu ) about the set design recalls Denver

The year 2009 is coming to an end Many of my batchmates would agree with me that we would have thought about 2009 for so long I wondered in 2005 how 2009 would be because just like 2003 and 2005 we always know that 2009 is going to be a big year atleast for our batch Now the year 2009 has almost come to an end Yes it did make one of the most important changes in my life 2009 is a tag for us If we wish to go back to SSN or attend an alumni function we would be calling ourselves 2009 passouts I would be referred as Kavin of 2009 batch Kavin CSE A is all gone It is going to be Kavin of 2009 Lol Every one of our batch mates would have known that they were travelling in the same road of education until 2009 It is in 2009 we departed each taking our own ways Some went on for jobs business and some want to travel in the same path of education I belong to the latter Looking back 2009 it has been a great year for TAGS It gained popularity which spread like wild fire More people came to adopt and we were able to do it really fast This day happens to be the Second Anniversary of TAGS I wish TAGS all success throughout 
If u see dasavataram in each and every frame kamal will be there dominating the scene which is unlike his movies where he gives his co-actors are also given a chance to dominate like in Anbe Sivam Virumandi and much of his movies But in dasavataram it was purely Kamal and no one else though Asin was there she didn t do a great deal And it paid out for Kamal Dasavatharam is the biggest blockbuster of the year and the only blockbuster in Kollywood When we come to Rajini he used to be in every frame of the movie and his fans and all other people would love him for his punch dialogues style and fight sequences But when you take Kuselan Pasupathi would be in every frame of the movie and Rajini would have dominated the climax where he makes everyone cry Padayappa is a rare exception but in that movie also he was there full length while in Kuselan he was there only for 55 mins and in Chandramukhi Jyothika dominated only the last 20 mins other parts it was full of Rajini But unfortunately it didn t pay off for rajini as Kuselan ws one of the major flops of the year along with Bheema and Kuruvi And Rajini is asked to pay the debts for the loss occued which is really sad because when his film were huge hit no one came and and give him the share he is eligible for but when it is a flop he is asked to pay the debts Only one thing is clear from this For a masala actor it is difficult to give a hit if he doesn t dominate whereas for an actor who gives his co-actors a chance the people like it any way he acts if the film is good 
A great bu y to be with Never felt sad when am with him One more to say he does always laugh I dont know how and why ( Anomaly characteristics ) Relished and enjoyed with him AAAAAAAAA JJJJJJJJJJJJ 
here goes my testimonial for viveki know this guy for the past 8 yrs and still remember the first day wen he joined 11th in our schoolhe is very friendly helpful and a cool guy who takes things in a sportive manner and a good friend to be with he is very good at french and german he was our unofficial french teacher at schoolcant forget those days wen v used to go to his house saying v r gng to learn frenchand instead we used to play cricket inside his house his house was almost like a guest house for us where we get snacks and tea always we have spent more time talking to each other while playing in the ground rather than in school those are memorable days and he is one of the few school frnds with whom i still have regular touch hope we remain in contact till the end wishing him all the very best for his future career 
knew Mr Jughead / Payasam through a common friend never have met him in person YM has been the medium of communication Based on the limited interaction and his blogs I would say he is a rational and insightful thinker Sometimes tends to get confused between tradition and US life or at least tries to analyze it a bit too much Intellectual sometimes my sounding board and a little caring John hope the testimonial is exactly the way you wanted it to be :) 
On a business jaunt to Moscow for 2 weeks Remains to be seen how the next two weeks pass by Have the following weeks to see the place Luckily the weather is not bad 10 deg in the morning and around 0 deg C in the nights Apparently my hotel is in the mi le of the city and so all the good locations are nearby Normally I plan out what to do in such trips Having come alone am yet to look up even a Moscow map 
When I wrote that the first half of the film and the second half of the film are of contrasting genres the first being a B-movie adventure ( that works because of the chemistry and sexual tension between the trio ) and the second half turning into a dark Chosen One epic war film I didn t really mean to say that 's the problem From Dusk Till Dawn and Teen Deewarein are fine examples of completely changing genre halfway and pulling the rug from right below your feet So I don t really have a problem with a filmmaker choosing to change genre halfway The problem is that the filmmaker here has no idea of how to do it smart 
Where do I start the testimonial for a very important person in my life We know each other for the past 7 years and have been really really close for the past 4 years First I thought she would be a person who is shy unfriendly and stuff but later when we became close realized what a caring person she is nu We have spent so much time together in the name of combined studies chit chatting about all the gossips on earth All the last minute study at her house going at 10 pm on the last day before the exam for xerox sema fun those days Not only her the total family takes care of me Her mom is the best cook on earth keeps giving me something or the other Her sister has been really caring and the nakkals and teasing both of us do to each other chance e ella At the end of the four eventful college years the memories alone stand We may depart and chose a different career in life but the distance is going to make the friendship bond much stronger 
wat can i write abt this guy u need to think a lot if u wanna write abt him A picture perfect for a college going bloke very childish in his own ways almost evrybody in clg is friend to him first evryone said he 's a bookworm but whn i saw his pic ( the one with coolers ) no one will say ever he 's a padips he 's more than a book worm a voracious reader but his effects are limited to only clg syllabus Try 2 improve ur scope da machan doesnt know anythin abt english muvies or songs tht disappoints me being ma good comrade i want 2 u sharpen things on tht No matter u can ask my help anytime This little soldier has a gr8 future 2 come and i can see tht ( this is gotto be the greatest lie ) 
Yes you read it right unusual things happening today Like am posting more than a post on same day in an otherwise very much inactive blog i also did a trek to Skandagiri ( Kalavaarahalli betta ) It was all decided on a conf call on thursday night Friday night 9 pm - Dinesh picked me and we were heading to Praveen place at nagawara and went to Praveen 's place Raj joined as around 1030 We were chatting till 1230 at his place and then started The road going towards airport was awesome Dinesh frequently touched 87 and occasionally 90 + Then we had a break just before Airport flyover and had tea Started around 2 45 from there and started towards ChikBallapur The road wasnt that great as it was from Hebbal flyover till Airport Flyover Steadily went in 40-50 and reached the town of ChikBallapur around 330 [W e were assisted by Google Maps to reach ChikBallapur For those who dont have just go straight on NH7 and after Devenahalli untill you cross 3rd level crossing you reach ChikBallapur We struggled which way to go to reach the downhill from there Different people had different answers and we dont know whom to believe Worse is more than half of them dont know that such a place exist Finally we reached the downhill at 4 There we need to register for forest entry and optionally take a guide (200 Rs ) From then on its walk walk walk Initial enthusiasm lasted till 530 am and after that i was like tired We sat and had snacks we had taken glucose and continued Finally reached the peak at 615 am looking for sunrise But sun was late and didnt come till even 740 We had nice photo sessions and were chatting Photos to be uploaded soon to my picasaweb It was a well needed rest i must say and the climate was awesome Wind was very strong Completed all that we had bought and were reluctantly started moving down Moving down was little bit of tough task as the fog had settled in and made the rocks slippery Yours truly slipped at lot of places and at one place was saved by dinesh who had slipped just before me and was in a position to reach me easily Then we moved down slowly and finally reached at 915 
The Invention of Hugo Cabret was one of the most amazing children 's books of the last 10 years A beautifully illustrated book told as much through its imagery as its narrative it is also a book with a love for the early days of film particularly French filmmakers The book won the Caldecott Medal for Best Illustrated Children 's Book but I don t know which Scorsese will make the movie Will it be the visual master of Raging Bull or the talented hack who made Shutter Island 
Sriram aka mechsri is quite well known for his scholarly abilities very much unknown for his inhibited mischievous character Knowin dis guy since 1st yr has been really nice we r all one close knitted group over der n d kinda fun we have together goin out for movies budget dinner not to forget d trips we had memorable one to mention was our adventurous trip to Tiruchi in d 2nd yr holidays then our enjoyment at REC-T whoa whoa he has so many fans spread around d city state in d country ( especially gal fans ) We don t miss his treats every yr after he gets d merit scholarship so for d sake of d treat v all pray for him ( now don t hit me da ) last but not d least ppl don t under-estimate dis little guy from his appearance he is as explosive like a small atom ( in all sense )-- dat explains more about his naivity innocence for guys n gals who think he is I wish him all d best in his endeavours keepin rockin dude (PS among male peers too ) Long live our f 's hip Cheers 
The introductory song Guzarish by Javed Ali and guest vocalist Sonu Niigaam is soft and romantic AR Rehman has achieved mastery over composing romantic number and this time also he has kept his promise and has been successful in composing an ear-soothing track Tamil GHAJINI listeners can identify it is similar to 's uttum vizhi which was the song of the year 2005 The second track of the flick Kaise Mujhe by Benny Dayal as male singer and Shreya Ghoshal as female singer is exceptional The pair renders a stunning duet The instrumental version of Kaise Mujhe has soothing and balmy effect The musical piece has right fusion of two instruments guitar and flute This song slowly grows with you after 5-6 hearings it will touch your hearts The third track Aye Bachchu by Suzanne comes as a massive shock It has English words inserted in Hindi sentences but sorry to say the album is not up to the mark and will not make to the chartbuster This song is really disappointing as it has no thrill and one would never expect such a disaster from music maestro Rehman This track has lower down the glory of the album I think the director has forced rahman to have such a album similar to yes machi song in tamil Next let us see BEKHA An unusual song with erratic melody given to mood swings This is the song where you can admire Aamir not for his eights packs but six different vibrant looks and styles Rendered by Karthik the song is catchy in appearance Rehman has full faith in him and thus bestowed on him the responsibility of singing this soulful song and Karthik has done full justice to it

Rang De Basanti is another interesting song which has a peppy-westernized-punju feel to it It 's sung by Daler Mahendi and the South-Indian singer Chitra ( I had been to one of Daler 's concerts in Madras and the host of that show was Javed Jaffrey That 's when I knew first-hand about the talents of Javed Jaffrey he was able to keep the crowd in complete control with his jokes and anecdotes In that he mentioned that Daler Mahendi should be called Dollar Mahendi - that was when Daler was at his peak )

Pretty cool that Scorsese 's forst comic book movie is this wonderful serious little picture book and not some dreck for Marvel or DC Like Diary of a Wimpy Ki d this book shows that awesome commercial success can be had outside of the spandex realm of muscle-bulging men having super-fights with each other And it 's kind of surprising that Disney hasn t inserted themselves in this deal because it would be an amazing brand for them to get involved in This is a new classic that kids will be reading for years to come

Loosu girl Keeps messing her account and creates a new one every few months One good thing is that i get to write a totally new testi every time ( which has been due for 4 months i think ) One of my closest friends from college Knows even my deepest secrets and keeps them to herself which is the quality i like the most in her Even after starting to live on the opposite sides of the globe it is quite surprising how we maintain close contact This jantu could be bubbly one moment and get into the darkest possible mood within the blink of an eye But off late she has been showing great resistance to those dark moods even in times of stress Great going anoo keep it up She tends to be the person I call on when I am down and she tends to lift my spirits every time I chat with her Dunno wat I will do without this innocent and cute little devil Keep smiling as always 
shanks a guy who doesn t fail to astonish people with his cool balance of life does evrything ther is to do in coll yet maintains a cool rapport about him easily judged for a carefree guy how wrong can U be his GK skills - infinity has something to say about evrything uses lol at the most inappropriate places while chatting lol very outspoken sometimes can be very obnoxious about how he uses his word power (d anger his vocab is a double edged sword ) His style of speech is somewhere between awesome too good ( ithu podhum nenaakuraen ) 2 sum up one hell of a pirichivudals / ulitimate guy lol 
he most accessible friend and saviour ever is a genuine pal whose heart is much softer than it looks from outside He is a person who never was scared to tell an idiot he is one or to call a loser a loser Sometimes he is very very strange to understood and other times he is just the easiest to read A King of Kalaai No one can possibly escape if he starts in full form avalathaan On the whole he has got every kind of hero hi en in him - sometimes a Bruce Lee sometimes a Romeo sometimes a Man of Steel sometimes an emotional idiot but in every sense always ADHIRADEE and watever happens jst shreds it off with I Dont Care A cool bu y to hang out wid

I am one of the ardent fan of news channels and i always felt that its one of the revolution of this century But after seeing the happenings in the media coverage of MUMBAI MASSACRE I felt that these news channels are no way better than the politicians and they showed their ugly face many times I would just quote few incidents here INCIDENT ONE Lets go back to 26th of november the day the terrorists started their attacks at the heart of Mumbai If u had watched the news channels keenly a man was deeply hurt in his hand and blood was flowing due to a terrorist attack in Oberoi Hotel At the same time all news channels were covering this incident Wat they should have done they should have taken him to the hospital atleast they should have given some sort of First-Aid But do u know wat they did A Reporter says HELLO PLEASE COME HERE PLEASE SHOW ME YOUR HANDS PLEASE DONT RUN HOW DID THEY SHOOT YOU DID COMMANDOS COME FOR YOUR HELP But that man is under immense pain due to loss of blood but around 20 reporters ask him questions for whom a BREAKING NEWS is more important than a man 's hand Heartless people 
so here i go writing a testi ( for saving myself from the pester :D) anyways let me do it to start with she moves so very well even with strangers that gets her so many friends an then builds it all with her silly talks and dumb mokkas an acknowledges them too but the big prob in being one is she never stops asking for treats may be u must ask her how many she says are pending from me but all in all she is much more than wat am saying right now wonderful memories can only be shared wit a few ppl and she s one i must say talking as innocent as a child an doin all stuff behind is not somethin new to her an singing is onrthing that she s adept at an the best part is that she does wat she wants doesnt do something just because a group of friends do it good individualistic approach i must say a very interestin character is all that i can say to finsih this off keep rocking dear mate P S yabbbbbaaaaaaaa inime escape 
It was Michael Muthu who had suggested Moulin Rouge to Denver That night I took the DVD from him and ten minutes into the movie I had decided to do it I messaged Roshni and told her I wanted to do it Unlike most of the other musicals the songs here were already popular cult classics songs from Elton John to Police to Lady Marmalade to something like Chamma Chamma and I loved what Baz Luhrmann did with the colour and the costumes but the main thing that attracted me was the music

Is there cricket on in Wellington this week Anyone reading the Australian papers could easily have missed that fact in amongst the round-the-clock Michael Clarke coverage Nobody will be happier than Clarke when the attention turns to the action on the field come Friday when Australia begin the first of two Tests on their tour of New Zealand It is sad that Test series between the two countries have been cut back while five ODIs and two Twenty20s graced the schedule But the reality is that over the past couple of decades most Trans-Tasman Trophy series have been pretty one-sided with the exception of the nil-all draw in Australia in 2001-02 It will take something very special from New

Few years ago an ex-manager of mine who happened to be a vegetarian had a customary dinner with one of his prestigious client The client being a very famous hotelier had taken personal interest in selecting the menu at one of his restaurants My manager who clearly didn t expect the kind of hospitality was very embarassed to say that he was a vegetarian and proceeded with the dinner without having a clue of what he ate After the dinner out of the ear shot of his client he asked about the menu to one of the waiters The waiter who was beaming with pride on serving such a tasteful menu told him that the main item was an aligator He had further told him that what my manager ate was the tail of the aligator which was supposedly the tastiest part of that animal I am not sure if that bit of info pleased him or not but he did realise that overnight he had come a long way from being a pure vegetarian

There 's some simmering resentment still there for Norton though When he talks about the character there is a visible love for the full history of Hulk and Marvel Comics that isn t just an actor selling a film He 's a genuine fan and he has ambitions still regarding the character and what he could do with it But if Marvel really wants to win Norton back as a public cheerleader for the company and the character the first step would be allowing him to restore the full 2-hour-20-minute version that Norton and Leterrier wanted to release If they put that movie out on BluRay and DVD I think Norton would get much more likely to sign on His frustration over the way running time became a battleground on his film the same year that The Dark Knight became a phenomenon makes perfect sense and I think it would be great to see all the other Marvel references ( like the entire Super Soldier project subplot ) layered back in 
bodhai - ( I shall not dwell into the details of how this name came about right now ) is a very down to earth guy very intersting person to talk to that is if u can understand him and if he is able to hear u properly - ) good cricketer and a good friend sometimes mokkai but has a good sense of humour otherwise is a great fan of tamil film comedy ( like me ) goundamani especially on the whole a jovial happy-go-lucky and cheerful guy ( er i forgot the other things he told me to write )) three cheers for our friendship machi p s -it was during our class tour one night he came to to one of our rooms in the mi le of the night and started balbbering something like a drug a ict hence the name bodhai 
Hi guys Long since I signed into wordpress Anyways I 'm not goin to take much time now Yesterday I watched Poi solla porom movie Basically I 'm not a movie buff but part of project party I went to this movie You must have heard about the story line of the movie through papers and friends While watching the movie I felt Yes It is good Can be watched once But once I came out of the show and lookin back at crap movies and how directors unable to give stories spice up other things this movie appeared to be brilliant Kudos to the director cause he shaped the story very very beautifully and had enough twist in the simplest of atmospheres Really good movie Worth spending some amount cause it does it 's prime job just entertain and doesnot leave you in a frenzied state Meet you all later Tc and enjoy life guys

Achu the epitome of hard work A person who is extremely sincere in all his efforts a nocturnal bird who has almost conquered sleep ( almost cos he is lazy enough to sleep for 2 hrs in a day ) a good basketball player and an avid follower of the game Works brilliantly in a group Some one I instinctively approach for any sort of help Its a fast world when people conveniently give lack of time as an excuse for most things Achu has been my pillar of strength being by my side through my most difficult of times I am stopping short of saying a Thank You cos Achu will be the last person on earth who would have done these for me expecting something in return Only a handful like him can ever exist in this world and GOD has been kind enough to let me know more about such an amazing person He is very clear in his thoughts and where he wants to be in life and I hope ALMIGHTY gives me a chance to repay whatever he has done to me by being with him during his times of need as he scales greater heights :)

I have known Ramya for the past 4 yrs and she 's one of my very good friends at SSN to describe her she is Ms Cool Ms Confident and Ms Theramai of EEE B Has a great spirit She always tries to give her best in whatever she tries ends up with great mokkais most of the times Often a target of bantering in our class but she never has bothered about these and endures everything with a silly smile Few could match her dress sense pink red orange being some of her favourite colors you could easily point her out in any crowd for she stands out with her color sense Has this habit of using words like altruism philanthropist etc often in slam books and testimonials and only god knows if she knows the meaning of these words I have enjoyed her company in all vetti and crazy activities we ve done viz tours IVs symposiums so called operations and will always cherish those moments All the very best in whatever u do 
We call him Israelu This wonderful man has changed is changing and will change the course of my life Not only mine but also the life of few others ( Friend philosopher and guide ) But its so sad to see his taking a roller coaster ride ( Eppadi irundha naa ippadi ayitten ) He is an energy bundle and his capability to channelize it makes him great Never gets disappointed due to failures and he can keep doing the phoenix trick over n over again His ability to socialize move around with people and tackle situations is really mind blowing He just manipulates situations and can turn things upside down OH man this ability increases when girls are around ( LOL - )) For his mentality and attitude he should have become a lawyer or a diplomat Thank god such a thing never happ or else we could have never met A nice person to let out your feelings and secret Somethings are bound to happen which is not under your control for which u shouldn t worry SO just live the moment 
Class 12 is a pivotal point in any student 's life It is the stage where one has to prove himself so that he has a good future in his hands If he fails there then he may have to work hard in his college days so that he can live his better part of life happily And it was no different for me I had secured 85 % in my class 10 examinations at the CBSE level and my mother had asked me to take biology group so that i can appear for both medical and engineering entrance examinations At this point i would like to confess that until 12 Th standard i didn t know what is the difference between an engineering and Arts college I thought Madras Christian college was a good college and more over an engineering college at the end of my 11 th standard and i was praying i should get a seat there Since i was living in town there were no great coaching centers like iipe and aspire in our area and the only center known around Tambaram was Arul institute and i enrolled there in 11th itself because a rumour was spreading that they won t take in much students 12th and only those who had enrolled in 11th will get a seat there The class 11 was happily passing by and i was just beginning to know every problem by heart in my maths book so that even though i dunno the formula i would solve the problem easily because that was my strength of memory those times I cleared class 11 with a percentage of 90 and was looking forward to 12th and the tuition in arul institute had begun in late may itself and i along with three friends Bharath Prasanna and Aravind would go together for the tuition

It 's been an awesome ride the past 8 years purely because Shankar has been riding wingman with me through out The similarities between us are enough to fit in a book sized similar to the Advanced Oxford English Dictionary and i guess that is what has made us such good friends We live two minutes away from each other were back benchers throughout our school days and now study in colleges 4 hours apart ( the last point may seem out of place but considering the fact that we both are 48 hours from home it makes sense ) Non stop nonsense this guy can churn out at a moments notice Has the ability to rip anyone 's self respect to threads I have been on the receiving end more than once and I M known for my ability to dish it out Listing out memories and times we ve spent together will fill out like a 100 1024 character spaces so i shall refrain Anyway cheers to you dude Hope you do manage to set all your convoluted plans in motion and someday manage to get somewhere in life

For a while now I ve been relying on audio files for use as meditation timers These files essentially consist of a recorded bell in the beginning followed by a duration of silence and another bell at the end There are many of these available on the web and are not bad The problem is that you re limited to the duration of the files available i e if you want to meditate for 45 minutes then you need a 45-minute long audio file Mildly frustrated by this I spent some time this morning writing an on-line meditation timer Simply set the duration and click Start You should hear a bell when the timer begins and ends Here it is Online Meditation Timer Using Google App Engine and JQuery it took me about 45 minutes to build this That includes the time it took to prettify the site and type in this blog post Gotta love simple well-designed application frameworks JavaScript turns out to be a great language for toying with graphics and visualization This morning I spent a few hours learning about the Mandelbrot set and trying to code up a working implementation The link below is one of the fruits of my labor Mandelbrot Set GeneratorMathematically the Mandelbrot set is the set of points in the complex plane generated by iterating through the formula z = z ^2 + c For different initial values of c the iteration can either produce a bounded sequence or tend to infinity Plotting the graph is a matter of placing a black dot for the values that generate a bounded sequenc 
Look for Jeremy Dean 's rolling artwork Back to the Futurama in New York 's Central Park next weekend Pulled by two white horses it will be hard to miss this statement about corporate greed consumerism sustainability and human pride Look for more pictures on Flickr And at the blog Back to the Futurama If you are in the area check out the details Run Dates March 4th March 7th 2010 VIP Reception Thursday March 4th 9am-noon Location Pulse New York art fair Booth C4 Daily Thursday- Sunday 12-8pm Directions 330 West Street West Houston New York NY 10014 The buzz about Brooklyn-based Jeremy Dean 's art project Back to the Futurama has now gone viral with coverage in a wide range of online media As regular readers will recall Jeremy is converting a GMC Hummer H2 into a horse-drawn carriage to create a symbol of America 's perilously unsustainable lifestyle Jeremy has bet the farm on this project so to speak and exposure of the project will be vital to its chances of success A big boost came two weeks ago when influential car expert and automotive journalist John Voelcker wrote about Jeremy 's project under a headline that is itself an alliterative classic :\ Hummer-Hating Artist Hacks H2 Into Horse Cart Cites Hoover This article has already racked up 16 000 views and 285 diggs The story spread like exhaust fumes through the automotive blogosphere and there are now over 100 000 Google hits for Hummer Hating Artist Jeremy Dean The video that Jeremy made of the first cut into the Hummer has been viewed over 16 000 times on YouTube ( http // tr im / humvid ) and more in Vimeo ( http // vimeo com /8962281 ) Not to be outdone the equine community has picked up the story appearing here in nbsp Horse Journal Maybe some cart horse experts can help Jeremy match power source to completed carriage Of course this story was destined for mainstream press coverage from the start We now see the project making its way into the Huffington Post and it may be on Current TV soon ( it 's on their web site 's Upcoming section ) When us social media mavens talk about something going viral there really has to be a global element The story has to be covered far and wide Well here it is on a forum in Russia And getting from the East Coast to New Zealand probably counts The story was covered there in the equine press What is really interesting from an art perspective is the lack of coverage [s o far in the art press When assessing the work of Jeremy Dean the art world would be wise to take a tip from the film world Conventional wisdom said Jeremy could not as a first time film maker make a documentary about race not one that could be nominated for an NAACP Image Award Dare Not Walk Alone did not win that award but it did get a theatrical release positive reviews in national press a spot in Walmart 's catalog and on Tuesday night there was an Oscar-winning actor in the front row for the screening at the Skirball Community Center in L A Immediately after the screening the actor walked up to Jeremy shook his hand and said :\ Great Film Footnote Jeremy 's art has been mentioned on the influential art blog EAGEAGEAG but I confess it was me that did the mentioning (W ho am I to talk about art Well not that it really matters but I do have a minor in Fine Art from the University of Leeds I started a Master 's degree thesis on Hegel 's Aethestics at McMaster University and a doctoral thesis on William Blake 's Notes on Laocoön However don t take my word for any of this what is art 's tuff check out the New York gallery show in March and decide for yourself ) Jeremy Dean has started to blog his wild Back to the Futurama art project This should be fun Talk about life hacking and culture-hacking This one is a real mind bender A horse up front an audio-video-enabled riding experience in back BTW if you re a business that has the skills and equipment to convert a Hummer H2 or Cadillac Escalade into something like the model on the left and if you want a ton of free publicity let Jeremy know This thing is going to happen and the result will make the news There is a Contact link on Jeremy 's home page Update February 1 -- Slick 's Garage of Florida stepped up to the plate Thanks guys You Rock I loved my father dearly but there was one question guaranteed to get us arguing What is art One of the great blessings of my life is that my father and I arrived at an understanding on that question before he died not exactly an agreement but an understanding It went something like this Art is not art unless there is some skill involved For my father that definition excluded a lot of 'm odern art unless I could show him where the artist 's skill came into play Some 35 years have flown by since then but I think he would agree with me that the latest works by my friend and colleague Jeremy Dean qualify as art That 's because Jeremy is creating art that cannot be realized without skill as well as perception objects that have the power to make people ask questions and question assumptions even as they impress with their physical accomplishment I 'm talking about the Hummer-Escalade-Hoovercart the object at the heart of the Back to the Futurama project (T here are more pictures here ) I actually wrote a piece about this on my On the Road blog because it relates to cars and travel and life 's journey Starting next month Jeremy is going to take a GMC Hummer or Cadillac Escalade and turn it into a horse drawn vehicle ( the image above is just one of many models Jeremy has made to visualize the concept ) Making cars into carts is what people did back in The Great Depression and in the States they called them Hoovercarts as a play on Hoovercrats a term coined for supporters of Herbert Hoover the president who presided over the worst of the Depression In Canada they were called Bennett Buggies after the prime minister at the time They arose from a surplus of cars relative to a shortage of affordable fuel Folks fould that one horse or mule could pull a Model T Ford quite easily if you took out the engine And there was grass and hay to be had even when money for gasoline dried up This project is going to take a lot of energy and expertise Over the more than five years I have known him Jeremy has proved to be an endless source of energy ( the making and distributing of Dare Not Walk Alone being the most obvious proof ) But now he could use some help on the expertise side Not that Jeremy is a stranger to hands-on-artisan work I have seen numerous examples of his home remodelling and he is a skilled craftsman a practical maker of things built to last So if you know of someone who has the skills to chop a car hitch a horse or fit out the inside of a vehicle with kick-ass sounds and video systems why not use the Contact link on Jeremy 's home page and let him know You can also pledge your support of the project ( that page features a great video about the project as well as cool gifts you can get in return for your pledge ) When March rolls around Jeremy will ride this creation into a major art event in New York I 'm pretty sure the TV news cameras will be rolling when this happening happens How many people will get what this creation says about the world today cultural values lifestyle choices sustainability and human frailty I don t know But this engineered weirdness will get a lot of people thinking And that 's art Wow I did not realize it was THAT long since I had posted here I blame the day job which is often the evening job and weekend job as well Fortunately that job is going well and I am racking up kudos for my blog posts on marketing I am also getting quite adept at the social media thing ( Here 's a link to a personal post where I rounded up 19 things you should do if you want to promote your company band film book profile ) A lot of people are somewhat familiar with some of the social media basics but it is how you employ them all in concert that makes social networking work from Twitter to Facebook and LinkedIn to your blog your pics your videos your tr ims your stats and your Google Analytics ( which reminds me I need to a these last few to the list maybe Hey 19 Part 2 the Remix ) What has this got to do with art Everything There may be some artists who seek obscurity ( like the Bu hist monks in Shangri-La that were on PBS last night ) But most art is intended to be experienced And that seldom happens without a push from somewhere Consider Jeremy Dean the Brooklyn-based artist who created the indie doc Dare Not Walk Alone ( that I had the honor of producing ) He has been cooking up some cool conceptual art for several years now but it was connecting with a gallery that gave his private art a push in the public direction Jeremy will be showing at big art events in December and March and already has some cool art video online Speaking of that aspect of pushing art forward which is often referred to as publication and / or distribution we are seeing the and / or converge taking place right now in technology like Amazon 's Kindle You can now read Kindle books on your iPhone and PC as well as on the actual Kindle device Which brings me to the book I wanted to review here World War Z An Oral History of the Zombie War This is a novel by the first new author I have read entirely on the iPhone The book came out in print a few years ago and sold well It is currently around 300 on Amazon But the book is in several top 10 lists on Kindle which is how I came to see it while using Kindle on my iPhone I was intrigued enough by the reviews to download the free preview and on reading that I figured I would like the book so I paid for the full Kindle version There were three things that I enjoyed about World War Z First and foremost I admired the extent to which author Max Brooks had thought through all the implications of zombieism (sp ) Then he extrapolated a new reality from a defined set of data zombies eat flesh zombies can only be killed by destroying the brain zombies can survive under water zombieism spreads through biting and the dead re-animate after infection and so on The book explores the logical and logistical end game By doing so it reveals worrying weaknesses in current technology science cultures and religions ( Hint this is a global catastrophe of 2012 proportions ) Second the narrative structure created by the interview excerpt device was refreshing and very effective You learn very little about zombies or the war through direct description You get most of it by inference And you get a lot of rich characters too which keeps things fresh Brooks is skilfull at giving each a unique voice and strong presence using little more than their recorded words He also manages some great humor of the dark battlefield kind Third I found this to be a fascinating book to read against the backdrop of the global H1N1 Swine Flu pandemic Indeed I think that may be part of the reason for the book 's success the series of epidemics the world has been seeing coming from far distant places right into our everyday lives and forcing us to think hard about a lot of things we would rather keep to the back of our minds I am not a big fan of horror stories particularly ones that dabble in the supernatural The genius of World War Z is that Brooks makes fighting zombies seem very real and anything but a figment of the imagination Consider this In talking about the book over dinner one night I found myself saying If this zombie thing ever happened for real it would be really bad Talk about willing suspension of disbelief The common element in stuff I ve been reading and watching lately is this It could really bring you down We re talking about the suffering and death of millions of people here So you ve been warned On the other hand these are stimulating works they might make you think a lot and then you might have some new thoughts about how things could be made better Then you could act on those thoughts and the world would become a better place I guess we ll see First up is the movie Body of Lies Great photography and editing Great casting and acting And a gripping story without a cheesy ending To me this film was drenched in authenticity AFAIK what you see in this film is very close to how things really are in the field of espionage as in espionage in the field and the people who run it both locally and remotely As Far As I Know there is this huge gap between remote agent and central office--the controller cheering his kid 's suburban soccer game or taking his son to the bathroom while calling in the kill--which su enly collapses with a plane flight into the field Then it zooms back into the clinical and chilling detachment of eye-in-the-sky operational monitoring and direction ( with echoes of Patriot Games and The Bourne Supremacy but with great real world moral ambivalence ) We are left in no doubt that local assets people we turn when we pursue humint are considered expendable and there 's a school of thought that says this is the way it must be You rarely see that portrayed as bluntly as it is in Body of Lies Second up is the novel Timebomb which echoes that same theme of the expendable asset with deeper historical context as to how it arose The action here is in Europe from the UK to the eastern Soviet bloc but present day so we have disaffected Russians Jewish mobsters and Mi le Eastern terrorists Again the operational authenticity is there but layered into the basic spy v terrorist story you find the horrific story of a Polish death camp And this 's econd 's tory is not pasted on it is integral to the picture that Seymour paints of hate and fear breeding more of the same The author of this thick but very readable thriller is Gerald Seymour a former ITN television news reporter back when that title meant you got a lot of experience reporting in the field ( he covered the Munich Olympics massacre and the Great Train Robbery and spent time reporting from Vietnam and Northern Ireland ) Relatively unknown in the States judged by a dearth of Seymour titles on the shelves of two different Barnes amp Nobles I have visited in the last three months Seymour is a consistent best-seller in the UK and has penned a string of excellent novels For me his The Walking Dead A Thriller is the definitive novel about suicide bombing One of my guilty pleasures on a trip to the UK is stocking up Gerald Seymour novels ( not sure why I said guilty because 's tupid is more apt--I have to drag the things home on the plane and you can actually order online in the U S ) On a literary note these books rise above the thriller tag for me much like LeCarré 's work Seymour 's style is faster-paced but the depth is there His trademark technique is weaving multiple points-of-view There are no 'm ain characters but rather a half dozen or more people that we follow throughout the book The fun part is deciding who 's POV you re getting at the start of a new section A rare case of entertainment tastefully blended with substance The last review is 1491 and there 's an inverse relationship between the amount of truly fascinating content in this book and the brevity of its title ( Okay so the full title is 1491 New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus but what I 'm saying is this book is stuffed with good stuff ) This such a good book I am now reading it for the second time I don t read many books twice so this is quite the accolade ( others so honored in my post-college life include Gibson 's Neuromancer and Count Zero and Doctor Woore y 's Prescription for Enduring the Ending of the World the latter having more than enough ironic content to warrant the long title ) What I 'm doing with 1491 right now is dipping into several different sections at once It is a testament to author Charles C Mann s superb writing that one can do this I can flip from the amazing city of Cahokia on the Mississippi to the dozens of feuding Mayan city states I can read about the vast earthworks of the Beni and the sophisticated aquaculture of the Amazon then travel via Norte Chico a Peruvian civilization older than Egypt to the indigenous forest-scaping of the North Eastern U S And all the while I can follow the plot which is basically this America was a heavily populated and highly civilized land before contact with the Europeans That many millions of people died as a result of European arrival in the Americas either killed in conflict or killed as a consequence of contact is now clear This truth had been slowly emerging in scientific papers and publications for decades but Mann has pulled all of the data together and the effect is almost overwhelming I had long suspected that the sophistication and scale of indigenous culture and civilization was being ignored or suppressed With a minimum of moralizing and finger-pointing Mann documents the whole sorry story He leaves others to state the obvious conclusion Americans of European origin stole this land and we did our best to destroy the civilizations that once thrived here It took less than 500 years to erase tens of thousands of years of human history hundreds of languages scores of magnificent cities dozens of libraries and millions of people I believe that many of the consequences of this history have yet to be played out After all the consequences of ancient conquest in the Mi le East are still shaping events today and our post-imperial ahistorical ineptness in dealing with them is still causing problems some of which can be seen in a film like Body of Lies or a book like Timebomb Watch and read just try not to get too depressed about it ( Note In the interests of full disclosure all the above links are to Amazon through my Associates account That doesn t a anything to the price but it means that this blog gets a small kickback from Amazon when you buy from these links ) Since Roger Moore over at

It 's been a bit rough lately With the economy in the tank and people not wanting to spend any money I ve had great hope that some places were continuing to move forward with their urban rail plans But the opponents fight harder than ever because they see the threat or people don t plan things enough to go forward with any confidence Just today the list of articles that show how hard we have to keep working was a bit much for me to handle Houston - The Mayor questions whether there is money to pay for two lines of the new five line light rail expansion in the city Austin - The Mayor decides its not time to have a bond election to pay for a future urban rail line Scotland - The company building Edinburgh 's tram wants to delay 30 months after the rough ride they have already had Tampa - Ballot issue for rail dead for now due to lack of decision in how much of the funding would go to the rail project Bellevue The city council is a bunch of morons there and don t want to run the line through a dense employment center There is a ray of hope out there The Mayor of Los Angeles made me feel a bit better recently when he decided that he was going to ask to get things done faster Ask for a loan so you can save billions in construction costs and have something built for your money faster I would like to think that is how we work in the United States But sometimes reading all the news I do just gets so depressing At least someone has suggested a way forward Whether we follow it or not is up to us Wire Feed Every year I feel like I harp on this because I think that outside of these people with fancy gowns there are a lot of folks including press that could get there via the subway The first year I noticed this was the year that Al Gore won for An Inconvenient Truth It 's somewhat unfortunate that people aren t hopping on to make a statement They might even get to the show faster February 27 2007 -

A view of the windows in the room where Jose Roberto Arruda is being held in at the Federal Police compound in Brasilia Below a view of his bunk beds and office desk THE political crisis in Brasilia continues with the Federal District Governor Jose Roberto Arruda still being held at the headquarters of the Federal Police a month after he was accused of trying to obstruct an investigation into massive corruption in his administration The threat of federal intervention in the governing of the Federal District has eased for the time being with the federal Supreme Court loath to intervene in a district that was given political emancipation only in 1988 Last week the Federal District Assembly voted to begin impeachment proceedings against Arruda If he does not resign before the process is over which takes several months he could see his political rights suspended for up to eight years Last Saturday two district representatives tried to serve Arruda with the notice of the impeachment proceedings but he refused to receive it later saying in a handwritten letter to the Federal District Assembly that he wanted access to the full report on his impeachment before accepting the notification The representatives returned last Monday with two witnesses to corroborate that they had informed Arruda of the proceedings against him and served him with the notice Arruda 's lawyers have been trying to get him moved to house arrest something the Supreme Court justices have not been inclined to allow since this would facilitate his communication with supporters and thus possibly make it easier for him to interfere in the Federal Police 's ongoing investigation into corruption in his administration The governor is currently allowed visits only from his immediate family and his lawyers His wife Flavia brings him lunch everyday although she is not allowed to be alone with him in his room He is being held in a room of approximately 16 8 square meters in the Federal Police headquarters compound in Brasilia He had previously been held in a room of 40 square meters He has access to newspapers and magazines but is not allowed access to television or telephones His lawyers claimed that he was being held in a 'm asmorra or a subterranean jail which forced the Attorney General 's office to release pictures last week of his quarters which showed the room had clean white walls a bunk bed an office desk a small refrigerator a little sofa and a window Arruda 's lawyers have also been claiming that the governor is suffering from pains in one of his ankles which they claim is swollen and is linked to his diabetes Two visits to a private hospital this week found Arruda in good health taking away yet another reason his lawyers were trying to use to push for house arrest The three-time former governor of the Federal District Joaquim Roriz who is now 75 years old has been running political ads on television showing himself talking casually about the 's hame of corruption that is currently rocking Brasilia Roriz is expected to run in the October elections for governor again He has been embroiled in several corruption scandals in the past which make his criticisms of Arruda extra ironic Will voters here remember that when they go to the polls in October One can only hope so Jose Roberto Arruda left and Paulo Octavio in happier times THE capital of Brazil Brasilia remained in a deep political crisis this week with the Distrito Federal Governor Jose Roberto Arruda still being held by the federal police for obstruction of an investigation of massive corruption involving the governor and at least 11 district representatives Arrested on Feb 11 at the beginning of Carnival Arruda is being held at the headquarters of the Federal Police in Brasilia after he allegedly tried to bribe a local journalist to testify in his favor in the ongoing corruption investigation called Pandora 's Box The vice governor of the Federal District the enormously wealthy and successful real estate tycoon Paulo Octavio took over as acting governor when Arruda was arrested But he too has been linked to the corruption scheme and impeachment proceedings have been filed against him as well as Arruda by several district representatives Octavio found that he had little support in the DF legislature and after only 11 days in office decided to resign last week After a hurried meeting with Brazilian President Luis Inacio Lula da Silva last week he announced that he was holding off on resigning until this week claiming that President Lula had asked him to wait a few more days This was promptly denied by the presidential palace which did not want the public to think that the president was supporting a politician under suspicion of corruption Arruda was arrested upon request of the Attorney General Roberto Gurgel who has repeatedly warned that there could be federal intervention in the governance of the Federal District if the local government does not get its act together If the federal government stepped in they would need to appoint someone to manage the capital at least until October when national elections are scheduled to take place and a new slate of politicians can be voted into office The problem here is that the leading candidate expected to win the governor 's race is Joaquim Roriz a former three-time governor of the DF and federal senator who had to resign from the Senate in 2007 in a corruption scandal in order to not have his political rights suspended for several years if he had been found guilty The Pandora 's Box investigation by the federal police came to public knowledge last year when hours of secretly filmed videotape was released by the police showing Arruda and several district representatives in different instances accepting large cash bribes and stuffing the money into their socks underwear and handbags The police claim these were regular kickbacks made over several years by businesses that had been given lucrative contracts with the Federal District government These scenes caused a national outcry against such blatant greed and corruption when they were televised although Arruda still maintains the payoffs were to fund the electoral campaigns of the politicians Durval Barbosa a former official in the DF government who was involved in all of the payoffs secretly filmed them in a deal he made with the Federal Police to help them in their investigation In return he has been promised a reduced sentence The Supreme Federal Court was originally scheduled to rule today on a habeus corpus motion by Arruda 's lawyers but has postponed any decision until next week after Arruda 's lawyers asked for more time to study the original voting of the court which decided in favor of holding the governor According to today 's Correio Braziliense newspaper 13 of the 15 justices who heard the original petition to have Arruda arrested voted in favor of his arrest A district representative Wilson Lima is now the new acting governor of the Federal District He was described by Octavio in an interview with the Estado de Sao Paulo newspaper yesterday as a simple man What remains to be seen is if Lima can stave off a federal intervention until the elections in October and if Arruda Octavio and the 11 district representatives will be tried in court for corruption For too long disgraced politicians in Brazil have been able to cry on TV begging for forgiveness and then make a political comeback several years later as if nothing had happened One can only hope that the memory of voters in the Federal District is not so short that they re-elect politicians that have proven in the past how rotten they really are THE HASTILY announced new security measures implemented soon after the bungled Christmas Day attempt by Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab ( photo at right ) to bomb a Delta jetliner approaching Detroit of not being allowed on international flights to use the bathroom one hour before landing in the US or having a blanket on one 's lap were laughable despite the seriousness of the threat One does not deny that there are growing numbers of Muslims around the world who are being radicalized and pushed into hating and wanting to harm the United States and its citizens This is due to two reasons The rise of radical and ultra-conservative Islam fueled in large part by Saudi money and the US invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan It is amazing that so many Americans still insist in solely viewing American imperial adventures abroad as do-good missions swallowing hook line and sinker the lie that America just wants to improve things in the Mi le East How can so many intelligent Americans not realize that in invading other countries citizens of those countries just might harbor feelings of ill-will and resentment towards the invaders It seems to be a logical and very human reaction to such a situation Would Americans like it if Russia or China invaded the US to supposedly improve life for oppressed Americans I hardly think so The chorus of criticisms of the Obama administration 's reaction to the failed bombing were right in pointing out the stupidity of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano 's comment that the system had worked when passengers and flight attendants overpowered Abdulmutallab and in slamming President Obama 's seeming lack of concern when he initially sent out advisers deal with the aftermath before finally holding a press conference himself Napolitano had to quickly backtrack in the days following her inauspicious comment especially when it became known that Abdulmutallab 's own father had gone to the US Embassy in Lagos Nigeria months ago to warn them about the radicalization of his son An intelligence report was telegraphed back to Washington from the embassy and the Nigerian 's name was placed on a watch list of half a million people But he was not put on the much smaller no-fly list and worst of all his two-year US visa was not cancelled immediately as it should have been All passengers flying to the US have their names and passport details sent ahead when they check-in for their flights so that security checks can be made before someone believed to be a threat can even board a flight to the US If his visa had been cancelled and if the pre-flight verification system had worked then Abdulmutallab would have never been allowed to board that Delta flight It was the fast thinking action of a Dutch passenger which saved the day on that Delta flight when he leaped across rows of seats when he saw that Abdulmutallab was trying to set off a bomb and grabbed the explosive device out of his hands thereby saving the lives of nearly 300 people Alert passengers and flight attendants on flights to and in the US are indeed the last line of defense between a terrorist and their success or lack thereof in blowing up or crashing a plane The extra security measures announced this week for passengers flying to the US from 14 countries considered to harbor many potential terrorists with anti-US feelings including Saudi Arabia Nigeria Pakistan Algeria Iraq Afghanistan Somalia and Yemen seem unfair to me and are certainly not foolproof Al-Qaeda or any other group could get around these new restrictions by recruiting disaffected American French or British Muslims to carry out attacks on the US and Americans Or they could use Indonesians Indians Filipinos or Chinese to carry out attacks Americans and Europeans have to think strategically and cleverly in how to outfox the terrorists Installing those huge imaging full body scanners at all major European and US airports would be a good beginning They have hardly been used so far because of objections from privacy activists But in this age of underwear bombers these scanners have become more necessary than ever Who cares if security screeners can see the outline of your entire body Especially when the images are not stored and are deleted soon after being taken Objections that screening all passengers with these machines would take far too much time could be remedied by randomly screening a certain number of passengers from each flight no matter their nationality In a ition Western countries need to be adept at sorting through and actually analyzing intelligently the avalanche of data and information that they are buried under on a daily basis Firing a US intelligence analyst who spoke fluent Arabic just because he was gay has to stop too Apart from being homophobic and wrong firing someone just because they are gay is silly when there are so few Americans who actually speak and write Arabic fluently Western countries have to think outside the box and at the same time support progressive and moderate forces in Muslim countries so as not to alienate whole nations Pulling out of Afghanistan would be a good first step That war is unwinnable and it is a shame that hundreds of young Americans and Europeans have given their lives for a country that does not want their help and an Afghan government that is ri led with corruption And that too just so that Obama and UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown can save face and not be accused of abandoning the fight Afghanistan was never a good fight to begin with Bush got us involved in that Obama should now get us out THE Brazilian Defense Minister Nelson Jobim and the commanders of the three major branches of the military all signed a joint resignation letter a ressed to President Luis Inacio Lula da Silva last week over a proposed law that would have created a National Program of Human Rights and set up a truth commission that would have had the power to try military officials for human rights abuses committed during the military dictatorship from 1964 to 1985 A sweeping amnesty law passed by Congress in 1979 gave protection from prosecution for any crimes committed by members of both the military and left-wing guerrilla groups during the dictatorship This was the major condition that the military demanded in return for allowing the country to be returned to civilian rule According to the O Globo and O Estado de S ã o Paulo newspapers President Lula had an emergency meeting with Defense Minister Jobim on Dec 22 at the Brasilia Air Force Base where the minister handed in the collective resignation Lula rejected their resignations and promised to stop the proposed bill from being sent to Congress According to press reports the president claimed he was not aware of some of the provisions of the new bill The mentor and coordinator of the proposed National Human Rights Program is Lula 's own Minister of the Secretariat of Human Rights Paulo Vannuchi According to the Estado de S ã o Paulo paper the military was extremely alarmed that the proposed reappraisal of human rights abuses during the military dictatorship mentioned only state actors and did not include the various armed left-wing guerilla groups that kidnapped killed and robbed during that same period If they want to put a colonel or a general in the defendant 's seat then let 's also put Dilma and Franklin Martins there one active general told the newspaper He was referring to Lula 's chief of cabinet Dilma Rouseff who is his handpicked candidate for next year 's presidential elections and the head of government communications both of whom participated in armed struggle against the military dictatorship in the 1960s and 1970s It is obvious that Lula the first left-wing president that Brazil has had since João Goulart was overthrown in 1964 is pushing the envelope on abuses committed during the dictatorship He is testing the waters to see how the military will react Their reaction was quite strong causing Lula to backtrack and say that he and his Partido dos Trabalhadores will not support the passage of the new law in Congress But it is also a sad fact that the whole military dictatorship period of twenty years is hardly talked about in Brazilian schools or in public discourse I asked several Brazilian friends if this period was studied in detail in high schools and they told me no that it was just mentioned in general terms Brazil is still suffering the effects of those years of dictatorship Not talking about what happened during those dark years leaves questions unanswered and several generations of Brazilians without knowledge of crucial part of their history A National Truth Commission like the one set up in South Africa to deal with the aftermath of apartheid would do a world of good to the country Yes it would be traumatic in some cases and yes I think left-wing guerillas should be criticized as well but I also think that confronting the many demons from that era would be cathartic and healing for the whole Brazilian nation João Gabriel Vasconcellos left and Rafael Cardoso in a scene from Do Começo ao Fim I WATCHED Do Começo ao Fim a much-awaited Brazilian film with a gay theme on Friday night at Park Shopping and was a little disappointed with the script and some of the acting Directed and written by Aluisio Abranches From Beginning to End is the love story of two half-brothers Francisco and Thomás who grow up together in Rio with their mother Julieta ( Julia Lemmertz ) and become lovers The first half of the film shows the two when they are six and 11 years old each Played by Lucas Cotrin ( Francisco ) and Gabriel Kaufmann (T homás ) the young actors are much more convincing and natural as the young brothers than João Gabriel Vasconcellos ( who is a Ford model in real life ) as the grown-up Francisco and Rafael Cardoso as the grown-up Thomás who come across as being too self-conscious and thus irritatingly corny The veteran actress Lemmertz is excellent as the mother of the two boys She notices the intimacy that develops between the two half-brothers but does nothing to stop it Instead she has a heart-to-heart talk with Francisco and tells him if he ever wants to talk about his feelings for his brother that she will be there to listen to him and that he shouldn t be ashamed of his feelings The director Abranches had trouble getting financing for the film because of its controversial theme of gay and incestuous love Some producers offered support only if he made the two brothers heterosexual or if they became cousins in the script He refused and was still able to get enough backing to finish the film The director says he is not trying to raise any flags with the film but that he only wants to tell a love story without making any judgments on it Vasconcellos as the grown up Francisco kept laughing too much in his scenes which I found annoying and seemed to be a byproduct of his feeling nervous and the fact that he is a neophyte actor Lapses in the script also left me and other viewers wondering how the two brothers could live together as lovers and never seem to encounter any hostility from friends and relatives Nevertheless Do Começo ao Fim is a fine film that tackles a potentially controversial subject with dignity and compassion The film is being shown in Brasilia at Park Shopping and at the Academia de Tenis Mounted military police attack a lone protester on the ground in Brasilia on Wednesday THE embattled governor of the Federal District Jose Roberto Arruda announced his departure from the Democratas party yesterday at a press conference during which he read from a prepared statement He did not take any questions from the press Accused of running a vast bribery scheme by the Federal Police video surveillance tapes were broadcast on national television showing him and several other political allies accepting wads of cash from private companies that had been awarded lucrative contracts with the Federal District 's government Arruda 's move was a strategic one to preempt his former party from meeting today to vote to throw him out He had asked the Supreme Electoral Tribunal to stop the Democratas from holding that meeting but the court ruled yesterday morning that it could not stop what was essentially an internal party matter In his prepared statement the governor emphasized that he was withdrawing himself from the election next year but that he intended to stay on and finish the 2 000 projects that his government has ongoing in the Federal District home to Brazil 's capital of Brasilia Some observers have noted that Arruda will try to hang on for dear life but that the amount of corruption evidence against him is vast and that ultimately he will be forced to resign from the governorship Anti-corruption activists have been holding anti-Arruda protests in Brasilia everyday this week with the most violent one taking place on Wednesday when 600 anti-riot military police on horseback essentially attacked more than 1 500 peaceful demonstrators with their horses billy clubs tear gas and rubber bullets Horrifying pictures of policemen ganging up on lone demonstrators kneeling on the ground were printed in newspapers and shown on television Col Jos é Beliz á rio Silva Filho who was in charge of the battalion unleashed against the demonstrators hotly defended his men 's actions at a press conference on Thursday even after video footage showed him rolling on the ground as he tussled with a protestor Did I hurt him deliberately he asked defensively Our actions were perfect The head of the military police in the Federal District Col Luiz Henrique Fonseca admitted that the troops under Silva Filho 's command had committed excesses in trying to contain the protesters and has opened an investigation into the incident But he noted that initially he saw no reason to put Silva Filho on administrative leave The Public Ministry of the Federal District took a less sanguine view of the incident with Mauro Faria Lima a public prosecutor saying that it was opening its own investigation of the event by interviewing the injured protesters and the policemen involved Lima said the military police 's actions against the protesters were bestial A protester that had fallen down was surrounded by policemen mounted on horses The policemen threw their horses against the protester These were shocking scenes unworthy of a civilized country the prosecutor said according to O Globo newspaper We want Arruda to resign as governor now in December one student protester told Globo television last night in an interview We re not willing to wait until next year We are going to keep protesting every day until he leaves There are six impeachment requests currently being evaluated by the Legislative Council of the Federal District which has 24 elected representatives But analysts have noted that Arruda has enough allies on the council to have all impeachment requests turned down Warning Contains spoilers Spanish director Pedro Almodovar 's latest film Broken Embraces or Abra ç os Partidos as it is called in Brazil is not his best work I watched the film on Sunday in Brasilia after the film opened in Brazil on Friday Starring Penelope Cruz as Lena a young secretary at a large company who occasionally works as a high-class escort to make some extra money the film shows her father dying from cancer of the stomach that has metastasized Her boss at the company played creepily well by Jose Luis Gomez is in fact the rich industrialist Ernesto Martel who owns the whole company He 's a lecherous old man who jumps at the chance of helping Lena when she calls him up to ask for help in getting treatment for her ailing father Before we know it Lena is his lover living in luxury with him in his large mansion But of course ennui soon sets in and Lena goes looking for work as an actress She visits the office of movie director Mateo Blanco played by Lluis Homar and sparks fly Blanco hires her for one of his films and they fast become lovers But I 'm getting ahead of myself All that I have just described occurs in flashbacks At the beginning of the film Blanco is blind and has been reduced to writing film scripts He is taken care of by his agent Judit Garcia ( Blanca Portillo ) and her son Diego (T amar Novas ) A surprise visit by a certain Ray X ( Ruben Ochandiano ) who wants to produce a film with Blanco sets in motion the flashbacks that tell the twisted story of what really happened between the main characters Ray X is in fact the gay son of Ernesto Martel who wants revenge for what his father did to Blanco and Lena Blanco turns him away and during a ten-day period when he is left in the care of Diego tells the young man what happened so many years ago with him and Lena It turns out that Martel agreed to finance the film that Lena was starring in as a way to keep her under his control To find out if she is being faithful or not Martel sends his son out with a video camera to make a documentary of the making of the film The son trails Lena everywhere on set and off filming everything and handing in his daily shots to his father who watches them at night and employs a hilarious lip-reader ( Lola Due ñ as ) to help decipher what is being said since his son 's shots mysteriously have no sound The secret affair unmasked Lena decides to leave Martel but he pushes her down a long staircase and then drives her to a hospital for treatment She recovers but decides to run away with Blanco to Famagusta They stay there for a month but Martel manages to track them down and sends his son after them Tragically Lena is killed when a SUV smashes into the car she 's in with Blanco The director is blinded in the accident The problem with this film is that I could not manage to care about what was happening to the characters in the first hour of the film Cruz is amazingly flat in this film with a determined look on her face most of the time that just makes her look like a gold digger Homar walks around acting like an oversexed man going through a mid-life crisis while Portillo just seems to constantly frown throughout the movie The only character with some semblance of sweetness and naturalness is Tamar Novas as Diego The other problem is with the script that allows Judit Garcia to tearfully admit at the end of the film that she helped Martel track down the two lovers and even helped him re-edit Blanco 's movie so that it would be a critical flop Blanco hardly flinches at such revelations of betrayal which was not very believable All in all it is sort of a relief when Lena is killed off near the end of the film which does not say much about the quality of Cruz 's acting the direction she got from long-time friend Almodovar or the script that they worked with LAST Thursday December 3 I attended the annual Christmas bazaar of the American International Club of Brasilia at the Portuguese Embassy My mother has been a member of this club for many years so I decided to tag along this year since I had never been before The club was founded in 1971 when Brasilia was only 11 years old It 's original name was American Women 's Club of Brasilia but that was changed a few years ago to accommodate the husbands of diplomats who were posted to the Brazilian capital and wanted to be members of the group The bazaar was a slightly interesting mishmash of a bake sale cum jewelry and embroidery sale Tables were set up to display the goods of both club members and outside vendors I bought a beautiful arrangement of tropical flowers grown right here in the Distrito Federal in Brazlândia for only R 15 ( around 8 60 ) I also got a beautiful watercolor of a cashew tree for R 80 ( 46 ) painted by Therese von Behr a talented artist originally from Romania and who has been living in Brasilia for many years I also won a jar of Marmite from the UK in the raffle section Unfortunately although I do like the saltiness of the dark brown yeast spread I cannot eat it because it will inflame the gout I have in my left ankle What really caught my attention though was the Asian section of the bazaar that had steamed Chinese dumplings Indonesian dishes and a rice kabsa dish from Kuwait A Brazilian man came in bearing the Kuwaiti dish I looked in vain for a Kuwaiti woman accompanying him and later had to laugh and point out to my mom that a Brazilian maid in a well-pressed uniform was standing next to the Kuwaiti dish ready to serve anyone a plate of the good-looking dish for R 5 a pop How typical of Kuwaitis I told my mom chuckling They can t even be bothered to show up instead they send their dish with a maid With that we called it a day and left with our goodies to have lunch at the Gilberto Salamão shopping center in the Lago Sul

brief but with a fuller programme to come this Autumn New-ish Placebo drummer Steve Forrest nearly set himself up for a sit com moment thanks to a scant knowledge of late 90s British androgopop Yes he tells my paper from Sydney Australia where Placebo were touring recently he even thought lead androgynous singer Brian Molko 37 was a girl He recalls :\ My tour manager played a Placebo CD and I said This chick 's cool She has a really good voice It was only later when Forrest met Molko in person that he realised Molko is a guy and only then after two or three weeks when he realised he peed standing up It says here You d have to think that Molko would probably be flattered and delighted if someone thought he was an actual girl Providing it wasn t an ugly girl Well given that people are less keen on buying albums these days you do need to have a second string to your bow Will Oldham has just launched a limited-edition bottle stopper Each bottle stopper was individually hand carved by the artist Scott Millar so each one will be completely unique Anyone ordering the bottle stopper from the mart will be sent an email to download all the album tracks on the release date 29th March 2010 The idea is that if you don t want to finish a bottle of wine you can use this stopper to reseal it No apparently there are people who don t feel compelled to polish off a bottle once it 's been opened Here 's a funny thing - E y Grant has accused Gorillaz of ripping off one of his tunes Grant says Gorillaz copied his 1977 song Time Warp on their new single I am outraged that the Gorillaz have infringed the copyright of my song Time Warp claiming their song Stylo to be an original composition he said Breach of copyright eh Now there 's something the RIAA are always quick to have something to say about You only have to try and remember what a song sounds like and the BPI will hit you with a lawsuit for copying the music to your cerebal cortex without the correct licence Clearly Grant 's publisher EMI will be fuming over one of its artists having his copyright abused right [T hey said it was a private matter between E y Grant and Gorillaz Oh Um well what about Gorillaz 's publishers They surely won t sit back and be accused of stealing copyright - that 's like stealing hangbags remember [T hey said it was a private matter between E y Grant and Gorillaz Oh yes It turns out that at least the publishing arm of EMI aren t actually that upset at the thought of copyright being abused at all Indeed it 's nothing more than a private matter Perhaps they might like to have come to this conclusion before the BPI tried to write UK legislation in the Digital Economy Bill 
This blog has been closed for quite some time See http // martinaspeli net for more up to date content We ve had a lot of discussions recently about quality management of plone org / products - how do people who don t spend their days on plone-user and plone work out what products are worth betting on where they are going and whether they ll stay viable in the future A lot of really great ideas came out of the session we held at the Plone Conference We ve taken the ones that seemed most workable and turned them into a todo-list for the PloneSoftwareCenter To deliver these ideas we need volunteers - Archetypes programmers documentation writers product reviewers and project manager types If you want to help out please check out the OpenPlans collaboration site - a your name and thoughts to the wiki join the mailing list discuss commit code See http // www openplans org / projects / plone-products Since getting back into doing some Java / J2EE web development I 'm constantly struck by the sheer number of mega-frameworks that I feel I probably should know It 's overwhelming it gives me a nervous twitch like I could be investing lots of time in some framework that turns out to be inferior because I have no way of comprehending what else is out there How do Java web app developers ever get anything done Here 's a list of frameworks and APIs that I ve come across in my current project all of which could have some relevance to my project Java Servlet API JSP syntax JSTL JSF MyFaces / Tomahawk JSF components Oracle ADF JSF components Java Facelets Hibernate iBATIS EJB 2 EJB 3 JBoss SEAM Spring Struts WebWork SiteMesh Tapestry AppFuse Log4J JUnit JMock JDBC DBUnit Cactus Maven Cargo Ant Tomcat JBoss Eclipse MyEclipse Oh and I need to determine which ones of these can work together and which of my tools will tolerate which technologies Aaaaah To be clear my application is basically just forms that drive SQL queries I don t even care so much about security However a goal was to try and use best-practice patterns and technologies to ensure the application could scale up in the future Now I 'm pretty good developer I know Java ( the language ) well and I learn quickly But several of the pieces above would take me a week or more ( each ) to learn properly Obviously some are easier than others and many are directly competing But how do I know what to choose How do I know where to invest my time I looked for books but it seems that many of them are out of date by the time they hit the printers In the blogsphere there are people who seem to be able to pick and choose between all of these Power to them but there is not a great consensus on what is best this week If there is some canonical book that covers an end-to-end process with best practices - please I d like to know :) But I started thinking about how this works in the Plone community Im sure new users feel a bit overwhelemed and that we could do things to make it easier for them However based on own experiences from when I first played with Plone it wasn t nearly so bad Plone is there you can touch it and feel it and play with things to see how they break Python is terse and readable Although Java kicks our ass on API docs it 's easier to follow the actual code since the py files are all there and legible I learn best by example Like most people I started with a few copies of some page templates and later some Archetypes classes That meant I could get results very quickly Plone let me worry about my application and not think about security user management URL dispatch etc Of course I 'm comparing apples to oranges here Plone is a CMS and a platform for CMS-like systems J2EE is much wider in scope However my application is not so unique - I need forms page flow logic and database queries Maybe one day some CRUD logic and a few pages of text Obviously this is all in the terriotory of that infamous Better Web App video and the cliche exodus of Java coders to Ruby-on-Rails Fair enough but I d like to think that it 's not impossible to be productive and feel in control of a Java-based solution This is often a question of skills (p eople learn Java in school ) of prior investment (p eople have been trained in Java already ) of back-end systems ( that already run in Java ) and of trust ( for business-critical components that may feasibly need a web front-end ) I refuse to believe that just because Java is strongly typed and compiled this can t be done right So most likely I just haven t discovered that framework yet However there is another argument - Java is great for the mi le tier but less productive for the front end Perhaps we should put more time into finding a bearable way of defining service layers that would let you build your user management and GUI in Plone or Django or Rails and let actual business processes take place in Java beans or EJBs At least I think that separation would make a lot of decision makers more comfortable - Hibernate EJB Oracle ( or Postgres ) on the back-end sexy GUI app on the front end that is infinitely more dispsable and lower risk and is more likely to be what users want if it is written in a framework that encourages agile and rapid development It may even help to ensure that the mi le / back-end business objects are completely decoupled from the GUI and facilitate SOA Pipe dreams Anyone got a good Java book to recommend I 'm not quite sure why it 's called Java Server Faces - perhaps beacuse it makes my server a two-faced liar - but they re here Specifically we re using JSF with Tomcat and Apache MyFaces and whatever versions of the JSF API that Maven decided to pull down today ( I think we re on 1 1 ) Now I don t have the time to read a few books on the subject so I 'm feeling a bit ignorant and inadequate That feeling however is amplified many-fold by the fact that I am unable to step through most of the code that 's not behaving the way I expected Perhaps I could get there by downloading big tarballs and configuring source attachments in Eclipse but I worry this may be a big black hole and I 'm reluctant The balance of JAR files being managed in my IDE and deployed in various cases is already quite precarious so I don t want to upset it The second thing I miss desperately is pdb 's ( the python debugger ) interactive prompt Some things are definitely not working the way I expect I can get some way with the Eclipse debugger and watch expressions but it 's cumbersome and slow Thirdly my productivity is hampered by the constant re-compiles Every time I change something even a template I 'm recompiling and re-deploying to my local Tomcat instance It 's possible that I could find a way to edit templates in-place in the exploded war file in Tomcat or hot-replace them at least but the only way I knew to do that was with MyEclipse and it doesn t like my Java Facelets templates This is not made better by the fact that we have three dependent projects I have to a dance in Eclipse and Maven that involves 'm vn clean install on a dependent project cleaning code in Eclipse and then re-deploying the project I just lost nearly an hour pulling my hair out writing banal tests when it turned out that Tomcat wasn t executing the code that was being shown in my debugger Meanwhile this blog post has formed whilst I 'm waiting for things to re-compile Each time my distraction period grows a bit longer and my productivity dips a bit further Lastly ( for now ) there is way way too much magic going on with JSF components As far as I can tell every form button is actually managed by a generated snippet of inline JavaScript This ( or something else ) is managing some state that persists across Tomcat restarts which sometimes is persisting the component tree ( i e the tree of JSF components which is formed by XML tags in various nanespaces interleaved in non-obvious ways with the DOM of page itself ) Sometimes I get bizarre errors because some remnant of the page from half an hour ago is still being processed Sometimes not reliably reproduceable The only way I ve found to reliably test my code is to close down my browser completely and then re-open it after each re-compile / server re-start Joy Further sometimes the state appears to be saved but it 's not - when I click a certain button which has a client-side handler ( which is hooked up to a method on a bean by way of some magic expressions ) but which aims to stay at the current page after processing the UI shows form controls with values still entered but they are magically lost when I click another form button causing an empty form to be submitted Oh - and sometimes the first command link ( think an lt a gt tag except it 's actually handled with some inline JavaScript on an onclick event and bound into the JSF dispatch machinery ) that I click immediately after the application is started leads to a blank page being rendered (s omething about a phase of the component tree rendering not being ready I read somewhere ) and I have to re-load it to see anything I 'm sure I 'm just ignorant and that there are better ways of going about all of this but I ve spent as much time as I can afford with books and Google and now I just need to get some work done I 'm patching together working practices that feel inferior and clumsy but basically work Luckily this application is small so there 's not that much to do But it doesn t feel particularly elegant (/ me wants a view and a few adapters ) Please refrain from pointing and laughing but if you have some useful tips I 'm all ears I really should know better than to post this Really Please don t start a big flame war But I peer over the fence from time to time skim through some tutorials and demos on Ruby and Ruby-on-Rails in particular and one of the things that puts me off it ( aside from the sunk cost of my Python knowledge and the fact that my favourite open source CMS project uses Python ) is that it 's so ugly I have an in-built aversion to blocks that end with an end keyword Call it prejudice I once learnt Visual Basic Maybe that 's it but there are also lots of strange symbols flying about If someone has seen the beauty in Ruby please enlighten me I genuinely believe that code asthetics are important in motivating programmers ensuring consistency catching mistakes and ultimately producing better software Of course this is totally subjective But some good examplse of elegance and aesthetics would be nice One of the interesting fallouts from the recent discussions about Nuxeo moving CPS over to Java in the future is whether relying on tools like IDEs is legitimate and indeed whether this is just excuse-making for the deficiencies of a language I d argue that it doesn t matter Whether you call it a language or a tool is largely moot We don t edit Python in ed we use vim or Emacs or TextMate (s ensible people use the latter ) Some languages are complemented well by tools others have less need for them and some just don t have very good tools available The important metric is how efficient you are within your working environment taken as a whole to include your language your framework and your full toolchain Therefore the learning curve = the language + the tool If getting the tools set up is going to take you a long time you lose productivity Eclipse is fairly easy going Some of the plug-ins are a pain to get and install others are a breeze But move down one level and it can become a pain to manage builds with Maven ( which is very powerful but can also be very complex when you step outside the box a little ) or Ant ( which is not that complicated but requires a fair bit of manual work ) I know companies that invest two weeks of a team 's time just to get the build environment set up and configured right which surely is wrong And secondly - when the tool does the wrong thing you probably still need to understand what 's going on That complexity that the tool was hiding is rarely hi en completely forever because at some point your tool doesn t yet support the thing you need to do And in many cases the tool then expects to manage your source code in its own way and either stomps on your changes or breaks utterly Good tool design it seems is not much easier than good language design There are still some things I miss in my current very minimal Python set-up ( consisting of Python Terminal app TextMate Firefox FireBug ) such as code-completion and support for refactoring by finding and modifying code that needs changing because I renamed a function or moved it up or down the inheritance hierachy But in most cases Python is high-level enough that the tools I need are in the language itself saving me from having to learn a whole new tool And in the meantime I just love doing this cd Products mate CMFPlone CMFCore CMFDefault ATContentTypes This opens TextMate with all those directories in a project and I can grep ( Cmd + Shift + F ) edit read svn ( Ctrl + Shift + A ) a and remove files and do everything else I need The alternative is to start Eclipse find the right workspace and a the particular folder to a project ( or open an existing one ) Thanks but by the time Eclipse has loaded I 'm already onto my next task :) I 'm going to argue out of ignorance I am not nearly as close to the Nuxeo guys as I am to many other Zope people and I don t have very much direct experience with CPS at all However I want to speculate a bit about the recent announcement that Nuxeo 5 ( which is basically the evolution from CPS 4 ) will be 100 % J2EE in light of some realities that are abundantly clear at my existing employer CPS always felt a bit reclusive in the Zope world Florent Leonnart Jean-Marc and Tariq ( I probably spelled half of those wrong ) were visible in the Zope 2 CMF and Five spheres and I really like them and their work However CPS itself was ( is ) one of things that we often thought oh it 's really powerful and good but never really used Maybe it 's because I don t speak French Maybe it 's because I 'm a icted to the Plone community But CPS was ( is ) Nuxeo 's baby and business model Which is perfectly perfectly fine ( and it 's still fully open source as will Nuxeo 5 be ) Florent and Leonnart in particular contributed tons to CMF Five and other parts of the stack But it 's these contributions we ll miss (p resuming they stop which I hope they don t ) not the CPS-specific Zope technology that we never much re-used ( or got around to looking at perhaps ) I ve been doing some J2EE work lately There are things that are quite good about it and there are things that are not The Nuxeo 5 FAQ says that Java can be pleasurable with the right tool support Maybe but I can count on all my hands and toes the number of hours I ve lost to trying to get the build system to play ball configuring various tools and plug-ins and debugging strange errors in non-readable code I 'm sure it d be much better if I worked with Java day in day out got tons of training and had it all laid out for me by a standard build that some soul had spent months setting up and testing At my employer that ll never be the reality I have some particular beef with JSF ( Java Server Faces ) It may be the best Java 's got for web UI but it 's still painfully slow and often unpredictable ( I see some component tree state caches that don t invalidate properly for example ) It does not play well with JSP at all Java Facelets help and even have METAL-style macros but don t even think of showing a complex JSF-based UI to a web designer It 's hard to know where the line between HTML and JSF components go and JSF components still involve writing HTML to an output stream with Java code ( they say they re working on it ) I 'm sure I just don t understand it but I have seen supposedly cutting-edge JSF work ( in Alfresco ) and it 's still awkard (s ingle templates having a myriad of responsibilities ) The reason that I don t understand it because the stack is a mile high JSF builds on JSP builds on servlets builds on streams builds on EJBs are just scary Hibernate is quite good actually but I found it hard to debug I 'm quite quick at picking up new technologies but the amount of technologies I have to understand to be productive is so large I really wanted to use Spring but that was another book to read Again if I did it day in day out and could affort to take a month on a training course or two I d probably do fine but it 's not the reality Will Nuxeo 's programmers be happier with Java Perhaps so it may fit their brains well They may find that it pays back in terms of stability predictability and scalability ( I 'm somewhat sceptical of those arguments ) They will certainly find it easier to hire new talented developers But I can t help suspect that this has a lot to do with commercial realities Alfresco has created a lot of noise off a product that 's very very impressive on paper and reasonably impressive on screen It doesn t have anywhere near Plone 's customisation / application-building story for example But if you read the spec list it includes things like JSR170 and JSR168 Java standards (s upposedly ) for content storage and portlets respectively It talks to Lucene and Hibernate and MyFaces and MySQL it uses Spring These are things that are often singled out as best-of-breed open source components A digression the Open Source in Java Enterprise world is bit of a parallel universe to the one we know in Zope and Plone Different kinds of people hang out there Investment comes from heavy-weights and Sun specification working groups Apache / Jakarta are kings ( and they have a lot of very very impressive software ) end digession But Gartner goes out and says demand JSR170 to avoid lock-in The ZODB makes IT managers quiver ( call it an object store not a database Matt Hammilton says ) Butler says demand JSR168 to integrate your applications with your portal server IBM tell you maybe it ll even work We have viewlets and component architectures that make those things seem like last year 's fashion but that isn t what people buying IT look for And probably for good reason They shouldn t invest their money in unproven solutions hard-to-integrate platforms or dying products It 's often a lot of money on the table and being conservative is often a good thing ( whether they always get what the bought is another story ) So for Nuxeo I 'm sure that their clients will be very much more impressed if the 10 minute PowerPoint sales pitch includes a number of technologies they have heard about It makes a lot of sense especially since their stated target is the ECM sphere and I 'm guessing their customers have a lot of similar Java technologies already deployed And I am really glad that there will be a credible alternative to Alfresco in the Java-based ECM / DMS market As far as Plone is concerned I think our edge will always be in flexibility and agility I can do things with Plone much faster than I can with any other platform and I can develop cleaner better-tested components using Zope 3 technologies than any other platform I ve ever seen At the same time people like Enfold are doing incredible things with integration and Plone 3 0 should put us back on the innovation curve with exciting new tools and technologies Mostly I 'm not worried because the Plone community is so vibrant with so many cool people and such a lot of friendship In open source this is worth more than technology But at the same time I 'm very eager to find out what Nuxeo 's very talented developers will manage to come up with Hopefully I ll have a chance to sit down with them over a drink and get their experiences straight from the horse 's mouth Nuxeo com / org have a commercial story to tell I wish them the best of luck Sometimes doing debugging through-the-web is unavoidable Templates are a prime example - I just spent the better part of two hours trying to work out why my use of metal macro was not playing ball with a Five browser view ( hint understand what macro you re actually calling ) Sometimes I also simply don t know enoug about how something works to write a reliable and more easily debuggable test and some trial-and-error is needed A few things can make it more bearable though Customise default_error_message That is go to portal_skins / plone_templates in the ZMI and customise this template Remove the call to metal use-macro = here / main_template / macros / main Why Because rendering Plone 's full 404 template takes a few seconds on my machine For some reason this template has always been dog slow For debugging all you care about is the error message By not referencing main_template you get a plain-text error message which renders instantly While you re at it change lt translate = content = 's tructure err_value gt to gt translate = content = err_value gt removing the structure keyword This gives you a plain-text error message which will not hide thing slike in when the browser things its HTML A an external method with a pdb break point e g I have Extensions / debug py which contains only def debug (s elf ): import pdb pdb set_trace () Then either in the portal_skins / custom folder or just the root of the Plone site a an External Method in the ZMI with name debug-ex module debug method debug With this in place you can go to http // localhost 8080 / Plone / foo / debug-ex Make sure you run Zope in the foreground ( zopectl fg ) Your browser will hang but on the console that you launched Zope you will get a pdb session where self refers to the current context ( i e foo in the URL above ) Here you can do whatever you want such as inspect the object or mutate it Remember you can import other code call protected methods - do pretty much anything you can do on the interpreter shell Type pp to pretty-print a variable or an expression Type c and press Enter to get your browser back If you re using a Five browser view with a template ( either via the template argument to the ZCML directive or via an explicitly invoked ViewPageTemplateFile / ZopeTwoPageTemplateFile remember that this does not have security assertions the way pt files in portal_skins does That is you can do things like tal content = python foo _secretVariable __of__ ( context ) aq_chain So long as you re in debug mode the you can reload the page and see the output of that statement This is quite useful for trying things out and quick-inspecting variables Be ruthless with pdb Sometimes you are wondering how something works deep inside Zope So long as you revert your changes afterwards you can put a pdb statement almost anywhere For example whilst debugging a security problem enable verbose-security in zope conf and try to put a pdb statement in AccessControl ImplPython validate () You ll have to restart Zope obviously for this to take effect Interleave your work Sometimes you need to restart Zope This is slow :) Learn to do two things at once e g work on improving tests for other parts of the code writing new interfaces or updating documentation while Zope is restarting or go help someone with their problems on plone on IRC :)

Wow it 's been awhile since I ve blogged I had previously posted a couple of messages on here about some of the personal upheaval that 's kept me away from the puppetry intrawebs for so long I 'm somewhat reluctant to discuss my personal life and circumstances in a public forum like this - if anything recent events have taught me to never ever do that again - but suffice to say I had a number of deaths and serious illnesses among my family and friends including the passing of my father and the combination of natural grief and dealing with all the mundane things you have to deal with when people die or are ill kept me away and distracted I owe an especially big apology to everyone who enrolled in the Puppet Building 101 course (s ee previous post ) I was running at the beginning of the summer Circumstances forced me to postpone the course after it started by a few weeks then until the Fall and finally to cancel it outright because changes in my personal and professional responsibilities just don t allow me the time to do it Refunds to everyone who enrolled were held up because of some PayPal-related snafus but I 'm relieved to say that the last of them were issued this week Now it 's come to my attention recently that there was some particularly nasty chat about this on at least one other puppetry website I haven t really been online much for several months and the relevant threads seem to have now been deleted by moderators but this flame war seemed to escalate last week to the point where certain individuals ( well ok mainly one individual ) who had been enrolled in the course wase harassing and beginning to cyberstalk other members of the online puppetry community I certainly can understand people being upset and frustrated about Puppet Building 101 but I 'm baffled as to why someone seems to be taking that out on folks who have nothing to do with the situation I am not going to name names but this person knows who they are and would like to appeal to them to come to their senses and stop this You are only going to end up hurting yourself and not the person you re mad at ( me ) I do want to take this opportunity to publicly and sincerely apologise to anyone who was enrolled for the cancellation as well as any inconvenience and frustration the long drawn-out situation caused Although the circumstances were largely out of my control I wish I had been able to deal with the situation in a more prompt manner I ve spent a long time building up a lot of goodwill with this little ol blog here and it 's unfortunate that it has become tainted by the fallout from my Summer from Hell So to the two dozen or so people who were affected please accept my unconditional apology I hope I can find a way to make it up to you in the future Sorry for the lack of recent updates I ve recently been occupied by a family emergency and updates may be few and far between over the summer as a result If you re enrolled in the Puppet Building 101 course it 's been placed on hold until July 13th at which point it will resume I have no definite future plans right now but things will probably return to normal sometime around late August or early September Thanks for your understanding Kathy Danley made a short video featuring an adorable Sock Zombie Remember Erin Glaser 's Sock Zombies Well Kathy Danley went and made a short film with one of them You can watch Sock Zombie doing the dating thing on YouTube Jay ThePal ( and Kay ThePal ) seem to be popping up all over social media lately It took me a little while to figure out what was up with Jay ThePal a puppet character that seemed to start popping up all over every social media website that you can think of lately I think I first saw him ( along with Kay ThePal ) when they gave me a shout-out on 12seconds tv which is sort of Twitter for video Jay ThePal is one of those FAO Schwartz Whatnot Muppet puppets and seems to be a sort of puppetry experiment that 's happening all over the web ( Twitter YouTube 12seconds etc ) It 's a little difficult to get a handle on the whole project or where it 's going but it 's very interesting to watch how people are using puppetry to explore social media Definitely something to keep an eye on Puppetry students at the University of Hawaii re-create The Evolution of Dance with a puppet I love Bunraku-style puppetry so I really enjoyed seeing A Study of Movement (T he Evolution of Dance ) a final project for a puppetry class at the University of Hawaii inspired by the famous YouTube viral video Paul recently did a great post on his blog about Jim Henson 's early commercial spots and how that could be a successful advertising model today I think he 's absolutely right his post reminds me of one I wrote a couple years ago called Using Puppets To Pay The Bills The 30 second pre-roll ad is almost universally hated The web is a new medium that we re still in early stages of exploring The people who really break through and define it will be the ones who figure out new ways of telling stories and develop new ( old ) ways of thinking about advertising and sponsorship Dan Stevers creates Christian-themed motion graphics Over the past month or I ve been watching and enjoying Dan Stevers Christian-themed motion graphics videos on Vimeo Two of my favourites are The Light of the World and Life With God Some of Dan 's videos are artistic interpretations of Christian scripture while others simply illustrate basic Christian principles You can see all of Dan 's videos on Vimeo His work is available to purchase from Worship House Media OK nicely combines puppetry and pop-up books I know at least a couple puppeteers who love to make pop-up books This music video from an unfortunately named band seems to combine those two interests very nicely Via Mary Robinette Kowal 
Thomas Ford packed over 70 music lovers into our meeting room last Friday night as the four-piece band Trillium performed for our Friday at the Ford concert series As usual the concert was presented by the Western Springs Library Friends who also provided refreshments It got a little warm in the room but it was a happy warm with many tapping feet Because it was almost St Patrick 's Day the band featured a number of tunes of Irish origin but they also played bluegrass American folk and jazz Every piece sent us in an enjoyable new direction The audience seemed to appreciate the virtuosity The band seemed to really like the attentive audience The applause was hearty and there was a fairly brisk sale of CDs after the concert Mim Eichmann ( hammered dulcimer and vocals ) said that the band enjoys playing at libraries and would like to get more jobs in the Chicago area Biographies sample music and contact info can be found at their website Throughout my career as a librarian one activity that I have enjoyed is looking at picture in the mi le of biographies and memoirs They evoke in me a feeling similar to finding old pictures in a drawer in my mother 's house I can become transfixed This can easily happen at the library when I find new books sitting on a cart right out of technical processing when I am working on reference questions or when I am weeding collections I find myself gazing at the photos of the subjects in their youth then doing whatever made them famous and finally in old age There is often more to see than just famous people - there are old clothes old cars and interesting locations I am hooked by these glossy pages At a recent book discussion one of the club members said that her favorite thing about biographies were the pictures in the mi le I understood but I was su enly conscious of all the biographies that I have examined in the past three years that did not have picture-in-the-mi le sections I wondered why I had not thought about the change - if there really has been a change So I decided to do a little investigating I have been looking at many biographies published in 2009 anyway so I created a spreadsheet to keep track of how these books deal with pictures I used only third person biographies for the study no memoirs I discovered two common ways to use pictures in biographies 1 ) group pictures into inserted sections often on glossy paper or 2 ) distribute the pictures throughout the text with no glossy paper There are two other less common ways to use pictures 3 ) insert a single picture on glossy paper with a blank back in a few strategic spots in a book ( common a hundred years ago ) or 4 ) fill the books with photos and minimal text The fourth method really makes a different type of book a photobiography Looking at 66 biographies from 2009 I found 40 books (61 %) with inserted picture sections 20 books (30 %) with pictures spread throughout the text 2 books (3 %) with single inserted pages 2 books were photobiographies (3 %) 4 books had no illustrations (6 %) This a 's to more than 100 % because Tom and Jack The Intertwined Lives of Thomas Hart Benton and Jackson Pollock by Henry Adams had both a color insert section and black-and-white photos distributed through the text while Rehnquist by Herman J Obermayer had both distributed photos as well a few single page / single photo inserts on glossy paper Seeing that more than half of the biographies still had picture sections in the mi le I wondered if I had really been right in thinking there were more in the past I decided to go back twenty years and look at biographies from 1989 At the Downers Grove Public Library in Illinois I was able to find 46 biographies published in 1989 36 book (79 %) had picture sections 6 books (13 %) had pictures spread through the text 1 book (2 %) had no photos 4 books were photobiographies (8 %) Again the total is greater than 100 % because Mozart The Golden Years by H C Robbins Landon had both color illustrations in an inserted section as well as black and white illustrations throughout the text My sample size may not be large enough to be definitive but it appears to me that there has been a shift in the way biographies include photos The method that has gained popularity is incorporating pictures into the text but separate picture sections are still found in more than half of today 's biographies It will be interesting to see if the trend continues with more emphasis on reducing printing costs Glossy sections must cost more and digital publishing makes it easier to insert photos into the text For now we should enjoy looking at six to twelve glossy photo-rich pages in the mi le of the book while we can For those wanting to check my math here are the books 2009 Biographies With

made them many by rereading them Abelard to Heloise In medieval Paris for about two years around 1115 to 1116 the philosopher Peter Abelard and his student Heloise became impassioned lovers Abelard even sweet-talked his way into residency in Heloise 's uncle 's compound to more easily continue the secret affair (U ncle Fulbert was her guardian ) Even in such close proximity the couple wrote each other daily letters ( in Latin which the letter carrier could not read ) praising their love Amazingly some of these letters which were lost for nearly 900 years were identified in the 1990s Using these and the better known letters the couple wrote long after their affair James Burge has written Heloise amp Abelard A New Biography Readers get a sense of both these remarkable people in this intimate dual biography Abelard was a brilliant academic who believed fervently in logic He was able to win almost any debate What he lacked was any tact and an ability to curb his own arrogance He needlessly made many jealous enemies lost many teaching positions and was often charged as a hertic When Heloise 's uncle discovered the betrayal of his hospitality and that Heloise was pregnant the old man was livid Abelard married Heloise took her to Brittany out of the uncle 's reach and returned to teach in Paris When his guard was down Abelard was attacked in his bed and castrated by the uncle 's men Heloise was one of Abelard 's best student grasping complex philosophical ideas and a master of languages Her origins are not certain She may have been the illegitimate daughter of a nun After Abelard 's castratation and his becoming a monk she became a nun eventually becoming the much honored abbess of an order In this book I think Heloise outshines Abelard He was really too devoted to himself and always needed someone to defend him She fended for herself quite well I most like that she refused to ever bow to Abelard 's request that she feel remorseful for their joint 's in She enjoyed the 's in and would always love Abelard Readers of Heloise amp Abelard A New Biography also learn quite a bit about twelfth century church controversies and French history Eleanore of Aquitaine even show up at the end of the story I recommend the book to history and biography readers Burge James Heloise amp Abelard A New Biography HarperSanFrancisco 2003 ISBN 0060736631 We are breaking with our past at Thomas Ford One thing that you could always count on was that the reference books were here on the shelves As good as that was in the past the problem now is that the reference books are here on the shelves but no one is here using them They are just sitting So we are liberating them We re going to let them out to anyone with a card just like other books magazines CDs and DVDs The one precedent here is the liberating of the magazines a couple of decades ago We used to keep the magazines close for all the students doing reports and term papers We now have online databases with full texts and those days are long gone Finally it is time to free the reference books as well Our Adult Services librarians have spent several weeks preparing to let reference books circulate With Sandy Frank 's assistance (s he 's the head of the circulation department ) we have inventoried the collection weeded out-of-date and worn-out materials and changed the circulation system status for each record The work is done and we are starting a quiet launch while we prepare marketing Here are reasons for this new service Use of reference books in the library has fallen off significantly in the past several years Librarians with access to online resources are using the print reference items less frequently Fewer clients are spotted using reference books We reshelve reference books less often The reference shelves rarely need straightening Clients occasionally ask to borrow the reference books so they can use them at home or work Much of the information in the reference books is available to us though our databases Reference librarians will still have resources to answer questions With less money to buy nonfiction books this year it provides more items to loan students and other clients interested in nonfiction topics Other libraries have begun to loan their reference books Meetings at the 2009 ALA Conference in Chicago and posts on the Booklist blog Points of Referenc e have discussed the new trend The primary objection I have heard is What if a book from a set doesn t return isn t the set ruined This is a possibility maybe even a probability in time Still having books sit idle seems a greater sorrow in a public library focused on current utility and not archival conservation I think the greater good will be served by this service I look froward to seeing some smiles when I let someone take a volume of Contemporary Literary Criticism or The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians We do not expect a rush of people coming for the reference books right away but we hope for steady use Maybe this liberation will even revive the section and make reference books worth buying again Ann Nixon Cooper died at age 107 in Atlanta in December 2009 just before her book A Century and Some Change My Life Before the President Called My Name was published The positive view of her death is that she finished the book in time before she departed and that she had had enough of the fame that being mentioned for voting for presidential candidate Barack Obama had brought her She had already lived a full life She did not die too soon Hers was a life to celebrate for its goodness In some ways Cooper 's life was fairly ordinary and not really bookworthy unless we are all bookworthy as representatives of our time What singled her out was vitality at an advanced age and living an affluent life ( though never conspicuous ) in the black community of Atlanta through the days of Jim Crow and the Civil Rights Movement She served as a witness to the great talents and work ethic of blacks when white culture was denying that blacks were equal Filled with photos as well as Cooper 's memories contemporary readers see and hear in A Century and Some Change how the families of black professionals could have nice houses send their children to good schools know powerful people and yet still be expected to step to the side of a sidewalk to let whites pass or sit in the back of the bus A Century and Some Change celebrates the good more than regrets the bad It is a thoughtful book that may be quickly read I recommend it for older readers wanting to remember the past and younger readers needing to know about segregation and forgiveness Cooper Ann Nixon A Century and Some Change My Life Before the President Called My Name Atria Books 2010 ISBN 9781439158876 Agatha Christie 's daughter Rosland Hicks gave Greenway her mother 's Devon country home to Great Britain 's National Trust in 2000 Within a few quick years the grounds and gardens with their beautiful views of the River Dart were open to the public and in 2009 after a few longer years of restoration and decorating with original furniture the house itself was opened for Christie fans to see According to author Hilary Macaskill in her book Agatha Christie at Home Greenway is now a prime stop in the increasingly popular tour of Agatha Christie sites in England In her new book Macaskill takes readers on a broader tour to places Christie lived including London seaports and villages across England telling a little bit about the mystery writer 's life and pointing out locations used in Christie 's popular stories An attractive mixture of archived and current photographs supplements the brief text Some show Christie picnicking repainting a mantelpiece and entertaining guests in her various homes Others show lush landscapes and well-tended gardens Readers see throughout that Christie liked good comfortable accommodations beyond the means of people without bestselling book income without ever being ostentatious Overall Agatha Christie at Home is a light treatment of the writer 's life not enough to satisfy a student needing in-depth information but enough to persuade fans to a locations to their English travel plans With Christie 's books continuing to be read and new productions appearing on public television it should interest readers in many libraries Macaskill Hilary Agatha Christie at Home Frances Lincoln Limited 2009 ISBN 9780711230293 After watching a film members of our film discussion group at my library usually first say what they like about a movie whether that be the acting music or cinematography We then move on to issues that the film develops After seeing For My Father an Israeli / German film about a reluctant suicide bomber however we needed a period to just try to figure out what we just saw Many of us had questions Why was Tarek on this suicide mission when he seemed to disapprove of the idea What hold did the terrorists have over his family Why did the fix-it man give him a new electrical switch if he suspected Tarek 's mission How did Tarek get into Tel Aviv so easily if their was such a high security alert What attraction was there between Tarek and the shopkeeper Keren Why didn t the vest with the explosives seem bulkier under Tarek 's jacket Why did none of Keren 's friends show up for the party on the beach If there was such a high security alert were there no police on the beach The discussion did eventually turn to issues We were generally sympathetic to the plight of both Israeli and Palestinian common people caught in the mi le of senseless violence We thought that was the general intent of For My Father However I wonder whether having an atypical bomber was as enlightening as having a typical bomber who believed in his / her cause would have been Then we might really have had something to discuss Instead the director took a rather Hollywood approach - lots of good guys and bad guys insert a romance between two attractive young people and create a deadline for the action For My Father was nominated for seven awards from the Israeli Academy but it did not win any of them It also won several film festival awards With the hype I expected more For My Father RB Media 2009 ISBN 9781440784316 As hard as it may now seem to imagine the modern state of Liberia was considered a great African success story as late as the 1970s Anyone who looked closely enough at that time would have seen the great inequities and built up anger among the poor but most of the world never looked past the facade of the wealthy upper class At the top of the social structure were descendants of free blacks from America who moved to the western coast of Africa in the nineteenth century Helene Cooper 's family belonged to that class She tells about her family and the revolution that changed their lives in her memoir The House at Sugar Beach In Search of a Lost African Childhood Fascinated by the details I listened to Cooper read her own book To my surprise her younger years seemed very American as she and her classmates lived in suburbs filled with new ranch and split-level houses Many had video recorders with which to watch American television programs sent to them by relatives in the United States They even ate American snack foods Somewhat to Cooper 's dismay her family bought an isolated mansion on a beach far from all her friends Every child got her own bedroom but there were no friends to visit them ( Here 's where the story strays from those of American children ) So her family adopted a poor girl to be Helene 's similar-age sister It was a very upper class Liberian thing to do The girl was named Eunice and she became a member of the family - except she did not get to go on vacations to Spain or attend the best school with Helene Cooper 's privileged life ended when Samuel Kanyon Doe led a bloody coup killing President Tolbert Rebel soldiers spread across the country killing raping and stealing ( I 'm not going to spoil the plot but Cooper has a very dramatic story to insert right here ) After a nail-biting month she and her family ( without Eunice ) escaped to America starting Cooper 's long-distance-but-never-out-of-mind relationship to her self-destructing country She eventually graduated from college and became a foreign correspondent for the Wall Street Journal The story of Liberia is very sad and can be very disturbing reading Cooper does not avoid telling about despicable acts but she also does not dwell on them While telling some of the country 's history she is mostly interested in the fate of individuals Readers will notice that Cooper has a slow political awakening but she never really breaks with the class of her birth Her unstated feelings are probably still conflicted aware that her ancestors exploited the poorer classes but she is still unforgiving toward the violent unruly people who tore her country apart The House at Sugar Beach is good reading Cooper Helene The House at Sugar Beach In Search of a Lost African Childhood Recorded Books 2008 ISBN 9781436164412 
Subtitle Small Worlds and the Groundbreaking Science of Networks I am fascinated by networks Certainly the social networking websites currently available are revealing in a less abstract manner how far our connections are really spread The most rewarding aspect of joining these sites was the initial 30 minutes after having signed-up when you were quickly reconnected with ex-colleagues and long-forgotten high school acquaintances From there it is mostly downhill and I am still amazed by those who find so many non-commercial ways to occupy their time posting tweeting and chatting away I spend little time on these sites and am becoming more and more skeptical that they will be able to retain their entertainment value ( and massive subscriber growth ) before being besieged by individuals and companies trying to push their products and services on you A recent interview from a Pepsi marketing manager I unfortunately saw on CNN should give a clear indication of what is to come Pepsi 's desire to have a conversation with its customers does not bode well to those who find a large aspect of Facebook 's appeal to be the limited advertisements pasted on its pages However I do confess to having a soft spot for LinkedIn It has focused on the business community from day and is now evolving into a profitable company with a clear business model By being a site catering to business users it is somehow more justified to find ways to drive revenue - a luxury not necessarily granted to Facebook LinkedIn is so great because it allows the users to really see the reach of their networks By using the people 's earch function on the site I discover to have contacts in Madagascar Saudi Arabia and Suriname and all of them are only one contact removed from me - meaning that they are connected to someone in my own 170-person network 20 years ago these same networks existed but it was just much harder to visibly construct them The premise of Nexus is that there is scientific evidence demonstrating how the network that links the six billion of us is not completely random in nature but actually has a certain structural configuration The author then demonstrates how such network structures are not just relevant for human acquaintanceship Buchanan introduces the argument by referring to a fascinating experiment conducted by the psychologist Stanley Milgram in the 1960s I was familiar with Milgram for the famous test that bears his name yet was unaware he was also credited what came to be know the 's ix-degrees of separation In the Six-Degrees test Milgram mailed at random letters to people living in Omaha Nebraska and asked them to forward the letter to a stockbroker friend of his in Boston He provided no a ress for the stockbroker but instead asked them to send it to someone who they believed to be 's ocially closer to him than they were Most of the letters made it to his friend as each subsequent recipient forwarded the letter to the next person applying the same request The most surprising aspect was that it did not take hundreds of mailings but six It was then the work of two other academics Watts and Strogatz who when further studying Milgram 's test found these six-degree connections to be neither orderly nor random but somewhere in between These patterns took on an even greater significance when they started examining other types of networks such as electric power grids human brain cells or the world wide web only to discover clear similarities in all of them Before returning to the book let 's look at an example given by one of my professors Dr Karen Stephenson during my graduate studies that should help in understanding how these networks are patterned Think of the organization you work in Most likely it has some type of hierarchical structure of management Yet by looking at this pyramid does it really show how the organization is networked together It is true that the person at the top holds a lot of decision making power but it is certainly bound to be the case that individuals scattered throughout the ranks wield a disproportional amount of network power These linchpins are the types of people you go to for questions information or advice and most certainly others turn to them as well If every person in the organization drew lines to each person they contacted throughout the day for a question or advice and then all of these drawing were compiled together you would see a web-like structure emerge In this web certain people would be crucial hubs as they would appear as being connected to a lot of other people as well Interestingly enough it is probably the people towards the top of the pyramid who have the fewest connections to others in the organization This type of network formation exists in all the communities we interact with on a daily basis Yet how is it that we are connected in such a short number of steps to people on the other side of the globe if we interact only with our local communities It is by people acting as bridges to other groups far beyond the ones we are involved with at a local level The exchange student you still keep in touch a couple times a year via email serves as a bridge to her entire network of friends and family back home Lose connection with her and this whole world ( even if you are in no way actively apart of it ) disappears As stated earlier this network layout applies to other areas of science as well One of the more vivid examples is the development of the world wide web Internet pages are being developed randomly and frequently However if you look at the links between all of the billions of web pages you find once again Internet pages acting as hubs and a certain order to the random development What it also means based on the study that examined the network of the web is that even as another billion webpages are a ed the number of clicks required to navigate will not change by more than one or two clicks These 's mall world networks thus make information electricity or gossip travel much faster than a world without them When I was home in Seattle a few months ago I took a trip to my favorite book store The Elliott Bay Book Company in Pioneer Square - the city 's most historic neighborhood Unfortunately it was most likely my last visit at its current location The bookstore is preparing to move to another part of the city Considering the fate of many independent bookstores this outcome is far terrible And reflecting on it objectively I should actually be happy For those of you unfamiliar with Seattle Pioneer Square captures perhaps the last glimpse into the origins of our modern city While I have a hard time believing the commercial- residential buildings constructed in the last decade that include a Quizno 's Subs and tanning salon on the ground floor will withstand the tests of time from an architectural standpoint Pioneer Square with its brownstone edifices offered something different This difference also included the aroma of stale beer and urine on the vast majority of its sidewalks Yes Pioneer Square is truly dying and with the loss of Elliot Bay it 's destined to become an urban carcass of its former self Notwithstanding the verbal assault by numerous panhandlers and con artists I thoroughly enjoyed the trips into Pioneer Square to visit the bookstore There is a certain sense of loss Yet as I already said the move will actually benefit me because Elliot Bay will now be located in an area I actually do frequent for its nightlife It was exactly for this reason that Elliot Bay was forced to move locations after a very difficult last 12 months in terms of sales An independent bookstore relies on foot traffic especially in the evening And you can trust me that those going out in Pioneer Square after dark were not the same market segment likely to pop into the reading room to hear an author present her latest work I respect Elliot Bay 's store as well as its business model and wish it the best of success We should all be cheering it on as the outcome post-move will tell us a lot about what businesses will work and which will fail in the future One mantra of business strategy is based around the belief that a company must either focus on being a cost leader or a high value-a specialist Finding yourself in the mi le is a recipe for disaster due to the competition you will face from both sides Elliot Bay Bookstore does not discount its books In the days of Amazon I know it is a hard concept to grasp that a bookstore may actually sell its goods at the list price found in small print on the back of the cover But it is the case They do this because they clearly recognize that a war based on price cannot be won against the likes of online retailers or massive chain stores What they do offer is exceptional staff who know what they are talking about My favorite thing to do there ( and what can also be done in an excellent music or wine shop ) is to go in with a set amount you want to spend say 100 and let them recommend different books for you based on your interest It is a great way to get guidance in new directions you may have not normally ventured and it is not something Amazon can offer you - even though they try However as this move is eluding to the specialization they are offering may still not be enough It is my belief that our ever enduring quest for low prices is devastating large aspects of value and we are not fully aware of it This value is what lies between a normal versus a basement bottom price Before parting on too extreme of a tangent I will just say that the subject of pricing will be further a ressed in an upcoming post And how is this connected to The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo I was in Madrid last July It was a balmy afternoon and we had made an appointment to meet a friend who was getting off work for her lunch hour She arrived toting the huge hardback copy of this book She was in full a iction mode and was unwilling to part with it even on her lunch break During my discussion with a salesperson at Elliot Bay a few months back I noticed my basket of books becoming disproportionately overrepresented with non-fiction and I therefore asked him for a good piece of 2009 fiction He pointed me towards this book and thinking back on my friend in Madrid I grabbed it without hesitating It is certainly an engrossing story which combines mystery sex violence and Sweden I consumed it in a couple of days much in the same way I would plow through a good TV series if I had the whole thing on DVD It is entertainment above all else Subtitle Thoughts on Humans and Other Animals I have confessed in other postings that my background in philosophy is far from profound However it is a subject ( in a very broad definition ) that is calling out to me with greater regularity I have read few of the great works and each attempt to do so thus far has been a struggle On the other hand I am always in search of modern day thinkers from whatever academic discipline who are writing about society in a more robust and shall we say philosophical context It is very difficult to do so without tying in the arguments of some of history 's great minds and therefore provides me a way to slowly develop a better understanding of some of their principle theses Wrapped in the discussion of modern society makes it a much less abrupt approach One of my favorite current writers is Nassim Taleb renown author of Fooled By Randomness and later The Black Swan In an interview I saw of him he recommended two modern scholars - Karen Armstrong and John Gray - for their intellectual excellence in their respective fields Gray is the former professor of European Thought at the London School of Economics and author of several books He has written on globalization religion and philosophy As is often the case shorty after being introduced to him and his works I came across several articles reviewing a recently published book of his Straw Dogs was published in 2002 It is a collection of musings stitched together by Gray 's underlying belief that humans in their rather modern distortion of humanist thought have essentially created a new faith but fails to recognize it as such This form of humanity grounded in its roots of Christianity is based on progress and mankind 's ability through such progress to create a better world Gray argues that to believe in progress is to believe that by using the new powers given to us by growing scientific knowledge humans can free themselves from the limits that frame the lives of other animals T his humanistic vision of progress outside of science is a myth fabricated only recently in Western society It was not long ago when humans thought of themselves as equal to other animals In many cultures they were even worshiped by humans Gray recognizes that humans are a highly developed and incredibly destructive species Since our arrival in the New World 12 000 years ago approximately 70 % of the world 's species have been eliminated which is quickly approaching the same number caused by whatever event most likely a meteor wiped out the dinosaurs 65 million years ago At the same time our destructive species is raging on in fierce debate about how - through science - we can save the earth from the overheating caused by greenhouse gases Perhaps it is Earth 's means of ri ing itself us Ironic to me is how many of the central responses to climate change revolve around the use of elaborately developed technological tools to save us from such overheating Humans have never been farther removed from nature as they are now It is through the abandonment of certain forms of technology that we will make the easiest and fastest gains in this battle Changing the way we eat based on a diet of local vegetables and occasional meat consumption and distancing ourselves from the meat industry would make enormous gains Walking or bicycling as opposed to the frequent use of the automobile is a very simple concept that proves incredibly difficult to grasp In a later chapter Gray reminds us that the average American puts in 1600 hours in the car to get 7500 miles less than five miles per hour Not much more than what someone would walk in the same time It is obvious the automobile represents more to us than a form of transportation Straw Dogs is not a book on environmentalism however the example demonstrates a certain fallacy in human thought based on scientific progress Many other such anecdotes make up the remainder of the book though I found they begin to stray more and more from his central thesis along the way Nonetheless they are fascinating and provocative It is a book that does not need to be read from start to end but can be dipped into at will as well Either way it will get you thinking After three rather arduous non-fiction reads I was more than eager for a quick injection of crime mystery one of my favorite fictional genres Hammett most famous for The Maltese Falcon is certainly one of the most well-regarded American mystery writers And it was a late night viewing of The Maltese Falcon with its solid performance from Bogart and a quirky and devilish Peter Lorre as Joel Cairo that prompted me to dive further into the works of Hammett It is clear that Hammett knows what he is writing about after having been a private investigator for many years His writing style is tight direct with no superfluous words In both The Maltese Falcon and The Dain Curse the stories move at a breakneck speed To be honest some time the speed and number of characters in the latter was too much for me I often had to flip back a few chapters to remind myself who was who and what had they done The book does not disappointment but it did not leave me floored either What crime / mystery writers do you like Subtitle Investment Strategies for the Age of Global Economic Change As 2009 comes to a close and we prepare for the unknowns of 2010 it seems a just time to quickly summarize the current status of our global economy There is a global shift taking place from the traditional power centers - the U S and to a lesser degree Western Europe - towards heavily populated emerging players This shift which would have taken place even without the near collapse of our financial system is now intertwined with the decisions made to stave off disaster over the last year The United States acted as the motor for growth and consumption over the last fifty years The American consumer has driven this consumption especially over the last twenty years through debt We are all aware this can no longer occur and a shift towards savings and debt repayment means consumption will have to come from elsewhere This U S led consumption has made an enormous impact on other countries as well By importing more goods than it exported the U S generated a large current account deficit resulting in the sending of vast sums of US dollars to the exporting countries Oil producing nations have likewise accumulated hundreds of billions of dollars due to the exporting of oil to the U S and other rich world countries Amassed with US dollars these countries through vehicles such as sovereign wealth fund are seeking a home for their liquid dollar assets - from homes on the French Riviera to large stakes in Morgan Stanley As exporting nations have been producing goods for the U S at low cost they have put ever more demand on natural resources ( commodities ) They have begun to see an upward pressure on wages as their local economies grow Both of these factors demand for commodities and increasing wages will fuel inflation A on top of this the government spending in the rich world in the forms of various stimulus plans and inflationary concerns abound even though we are currently in a quasi-deflationary period Basic demographics are also changing with Europe 's population getting older the US being in between and countries such as Brazil possessing a rather young population Governments will have to respond accordingly as they struggle to provide the services these population segments require Demands for certain goods and services will become more relevant based on these shifts The above encapsulation of global economics is the context within which El-Erian the world 's largest bond investor and former directer of Harvard 's Endowment fund frames this concise and relevant text The majority of the book is spent setting the stage for what is to come and what has developed over the last few eventful years He then attempts to outline measures that can be taken to benefit from these shifts taking place How as investors can we accumulate the wealth needed to support a prosperous future And equally as important how can we counter balance our portfolios to prevent massive loss through huge downswings in markets or erosion of certain asset classes due to inflationary effects I am no longer in possession of the book so I can only recall what stayed with me since I read it over one month ago This will have certainly been meshed together with my own beliefs Perhaps this is a more useful exercise Some points for investing in the future 1 Develop a view of the global economy and dedicate a certain percentage of assets to the shifts you believe likely to occur If inflation is a concern due to rising wages in Southeast Asia commodities real estate or inflation protected securities will be safer bets than cash or certain types of equities 2 Watch out for home bias Investors have the tendency to buy stocks from their home country especially in the U S but also in other countries as well Active Swedish investors place 48 % of their invested money in Swedish stocks even though Sweden makes up 1 % of the global economy (T haler amp Sunstein 2008 ) Investing in what you know makes sense up to a certain degree but does not warrant such a disproportional approach This is equally true in the States where a robust and transparent equity market warrants a large percentage of investment focus but not the absurdly high percentages most Americans have in their home market 3 Emerging Market Government Bonds can essentially be grouped with more traditional bond types as their government balance sheets are in healthier shape than many more traditional markets e g Greece and Ireland To claim The Prize to be a book on the history of oil already by such definition limits the impact this commodity has had on the development of society over the last 150 years What it really is is an analysis of global economic and military history over this time period framed within the context of oil The book begins by concentrating on the historic period before World War I when Winston Churchill as civilian head of the Royal Navy began to see the importance of replacing the coal fired fleets of the British navy with those using oil in order to gain in speed and agility Yergin chooses this as his starting point even though he then moves back 60 years to the true founding because this was an important turning point in how oil was used It was at this time when oil became a disruptive technology as it moved from an energy source mainly used for providing light to one that would become the standard form of fuel for all transportation After this introduction The Prize returns to its chronological unfolding using as the starting point a key series of scientific discoveries regarding oil 's potential uses and then later to the first wave of major U S discoveries Though oil 's history can be dated back long before this the foundation of oil as an industry and major fuel source has an American heritage In 1859 the Drake Well in central Pennsylvania was hit thus sparking the first wave of oil mania This mania brought all types of people from expert scientists and geologists to green thumb enthusiasts with nothing to lose The creation of boom towns in desolate parts of the U S became common These towns would quickly be erected often to satisfy the needs of the fortune seekers ( booze and prostitution ) Means for distributing the oil would be hastily devised with a very short term approach to get the black liquid to far off markets Once the source showed signs of reduced volumes or a bigger source was discovered elsewhere the towns would quickly find their streets and brothels empty The comparisons between the boom towns and the massive cookie cutter neighborhoods erected in the last five years in the States during our latest housing boom are strikingly similar The next part of the book explores how the fragmented industry from finding the oil to distributing it paved the way for on opportunity of massive levels of consolidation and vertical integration It was seized and later exploited mainly by one man - John Rockefeller of Standard Oil Rockefeller bought other oil companies both large and small keeping the efficient ones and merely closing down the others to limit any potential threat of competition Standard Oil was the first true monopoly in the U S controlling 90 % of the oil derivative kerosene Its dominance led way to growing discontent of the American public who lacked alternatives to Standard Oil products and became more aware of the incredible fortune being amassed by Rockefeller as a result In 1911 the Supreme Court ruled that Standard Oil be split into 32 different regional companies who would then compete with each other for customers and markets World War I was a very labor intensive struggle fought and won in the trenches with limited reliance on machinery World War II as painted by Yergin was a war in which oil played a decisive role in the outcome Both Japan and Germany lacked domestic sources of oil and were therefore dependent on other countries namely Romania and Indonesia to provide the oil needed to power their ships planes and tanks The lack of this crucial resource and the failure in certain cases to effectively distribute it to the divisions in need led to losses at key junctures in World War II events An interesting example is how German troops led by the brilliant Rommel were unable to seize control North Africa to the extent desired because at key battles they were without fuel needed to power their panzer tanks The U S and Russia were instead at a particular advantage because they could rely on domestic fuel sources An agreement between the U S and the U K also meant Britain whose North Sea source would not be found until decades later was also able to receive its needed share of American oil However having access domestically is only one part needed for success How you manage your operations is another Yergin 's description of a floating fuel station comprised of numerous ships and tankers that were able to provide fuel to other ship fleets in the South Pacific was fascinating Though the author dedicated several chapters explaining why Japan and Germany were greatly hindered by their lack of oil I found the book thin on other examples of Allied success The post-World War II era led to the rise of what Yergin defines as the the Hydrocarbon man i e the individual consumer who developed an ever growing thirst for oil It also was the period of the oil producing dominance of the Mi le East region The book is probably at its strongest here It brilliantly explains how the major oil companies established themselves with marketing (d ownstream ) channels in the consuming countries and favorable partnerships with Mi le Eastern countries By providing technical expertise in this region they were given a disproportionately large share of the revenue generated from each new barrel Later Yergin clearly explains how OPEC was born and the economic significance it played in the market - essentially by controlling two levers - setting supply levels as well as prices per barrel The 800-page book is referred to as the Bible of oil history The magnitude of this industry in terms of global scale and historical importance over the last 150 years means that in order to effectively write one all-encompassing volume a certain high level approach and style is necessary Yergin succeeds in incorporating the macro level history and economic connections oil has played over this time period However by taking such an approach it is inevitable that some other aspects regarding such an important subject will be less adequately a ressed I respect the focus Yergin took in writing the book and his unrelenting ability not to defer from it However there were two main faults I found in doing so The impression he gave when discussing the hydrocarbon man and his insatiable thirst for oil was that the oil companies were passively responding to the demand for their product that was being begged for by consumers However it was never discussed how this demand was stimulated to such excessive levels What was lacking in the text was an adequate explanation as to why consumption levels grew at such astounding rates over these years What were the relationships like between the auto manufactures and the oil companies Certainly these industries were strongly connected to the centers of power in Washington D C yet was never mentioned Hydrocarbon man became dependent on the automobile due to lack of alternatives The classic example of the removal of all tram lines in Los Angeles certainly encouraged such behavior yet it nor any other relevant example was even eluded to And why were such large vehicles in such demand Yergin refers to the adaption of the first fuel economy standards in 1975 of 27 5 mile per gallon within 10 years as revolutionary step which led to a drastic reduction in oil consumption Though the book was published in 1990 a few years prior to the SUV boom it is hard for his praise of such regulation not to ring hollow considering the impressive gas mileage of the Ford Expeditions and other light trucks exempt from these standards Such SUVs went on to make up 50 % of all vehicle sales in the U S The automakers gained on the higher profit margins of these vehicles as well as special deprecation status they were granted for business purposes Oil companies also make more money the more often consumers need to fill up their cars Such a thrust by automakers towards these types of vehicles certainly pushed hydrocarbon man 's demand for oil These type of factors were absent in his book The focus of The Prize as a work of economic history also meant that the small time victims of such a massive industry were ignored As someone who is far from an expert on the industry I am still aware of tragic stories such as the one of Ken Saro - Wiwa 's who fought against Shell and the Nigerian government because of the environmental damage the oil drilling was causing in the Niger delta A reference at least collectively to the victims of the oil industry as well as the environmental impact it has made was something due in the book yet was nowhere to be found Regardless The Prize is required reading for those on all sides of the debate as it provides the foundation to what has become the lubricant of our daily lives Ah France This novel with such French attitude scoffs at the wealthy for their shallowness as well as their unmerited sense of cultural superiority over the social classes below them Barbery does this by focusing her story around two central characters the door-woman of an elegant resident building in central Paris and the twelve year old daughter of one of the families living in the building Both of these characters are made to be the most culturally and intellectually astute individuals in the novel much more so than the barbarians that grace the floors of the building It would be easy to dismiss the stereotypes portrayed of French society as cliche however they are made so apparent throughout the novel that their blatancy somehow makes them comical Instead the subtler aspects of the book touch on more philosophical arguments regarding such subjects as art beauty the purpose of life and human existence - shall we say the pain et beurre of French intellectual thought The story is simple and for this reason pleasurable The door-woman Ms Michel lives what at first glance appears to be a monotonous life ignored by the inhabitants of the building However she finds comfort in this solitude and actually makes all efforts possible to draw as little attention to herself as possible To do so she must hide all her intellectual pursuits as not to raise any questions in the eyes of the pseudo-intellects around her However they are probably too stupid to pick up on them anyway When Ms Michel is not reading Russian literature she is hammering away at the shallow and miserable lives of the rich around her There is a certain sense of irony here since the pursuits such as shopping shampooing hair multiple times and wearing make- up are looked down upon by her that is until she catches the eye of a new resident to the building - Mr Oke a retired Japanese Mr Oke being someone truly steeped in culture and intellectual capacity is quickly able to see how the door-woman is not a typical type He then begins inviting her to various activities much as Richard Gere did to Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman The response of Ms Michel is not much different in that those superficial activities of the wealthy become appealing as soon as someone comes along who is interested in her When compared to modern American novels this book is more layered in that it offers a straightforward story of its characters but also dives deeper into more philosophical discussions There are a lot of cultural references as well What I see as being the major difference when compared to modern American novels is how Barberry writes to a more educated cultured audience than most writers do in the States As this book was the bestselling one in France over the last couple of years we can assume therefore that it was read by people of all socioeconomic backgrounds Heaven help us if it had only remained in the upper echelons of French society The subtitle is 'm aking art and commerce thrive in the hybrid economy I do not want to start off this post by saying something cliche like any working in ecommerce new media or Internet services should read this book though the temptation is there Instead I will say that in my own line of work this book has already given me a new way to approach 
apologies for the long absence i think that i just needed to fall off the planet after all the mayhem and recuperate for the gruelling last four years so as you guys are all probably aware i have been trying my hand at things other than shooting so have been doing a few commercials giving speeches been doing a lot of stuff with my dogs have been busy in the office with a few projects and it has been amazing been staying away from the shooting range although i have to admit that i do feel a twinge of desire to go and shoot everytime i walk past the range but i am going to make sure that i am completely rested and relaxed both physically and mentally before i decide to venture down that road it has been a long and ardous last couple of months and i am happy to have some normalcy returning to my life my phone no longer ringing off the hook and things are great i hosted my coaches to india for the first time and have been busy taking them around so we made the trip to agra and jaipur and it was great actually hanging out with them and not talking that much shooting so guys fret not will keep all informed regularly at least everytime i have news and that may not be as often as you guys like :) but hey i am just a simple guy living in a mundane existence 
Last Monday I attended Womadelaide a world music festival that was run over 4 days On stage here was Xavier Ru suported by two South African musicians in a lively performance in which he plays guitar digeridoo and an assortment of percussion instruments The last few weeks has been extra busy for Adelaidians as we have had plenty of special activities to attend in a ition to Womadelaide was the Fringe Writers Week the Festival of Arts and the Clipsal 500 - and all of them had record numbers of people attending Now today I can catch my breath and start blogging again because it is all over Part of the old Henley jetty forms the centre piece of the Artist Bar constructed for the Adelaide Festival Underneath the jetty is the bar where you might rub shoulders with a star or two it was reported last week that Tom Jones was seen here The ABC Wednesday meme was initiated by Denise Nesbitt To find out more about ABC Wednesdays and see other participants contributions click here A bit of nostalgia in the park As part of the 2010 Adelaide Festival the Rotunda in Elder Park has been transformed to display Super 8 home movies edited by Richard Raber and Naomi Bishop from hundreds of hours of film donated by South Australians My post last Tuesday was about Amococo a luminarium in Adelaide for the Fringe On Thursday I experienced it for myself - truly amazing and so relaxing Some people just walked around experiencing all the amazing colour blends others sat and c 
A story today from the nation 's capital that reinforces our latest lawsuit the city of Ottawa is using federal stimulus cash ( and avoiding any environmental assessment ) to run a highway through several endangered species habitat It 's one example of many municipalities seeking to benefit from the federal spending spree There have been several ridiculous justifications given for reckless stimulus spending One such argument is that environmental assessments on these infrastructure projects is too costly but of the 24 billion in spending only 1 % of that would be necessary to ensure environmental assessments are completed that reduce the toll on the surrounding land water and species When we drop billions of dollars into the ever-growing deficit budget one would hope it 's being done with vision values and care unfortunately the relative temporary suffering created by this economic downturn could wreak long-term damages to our life-sustaining systems for generations to come Ecojustice and the Canadian Cancer Society are taking action against a disturbing federal government trend that is seeing fewer and fewer dangerous chemicals making it onto the list of regulated contaminants Here 's some history on toxics in Canada There are thousands of potentially harmful substances used domestically and abroad that make their way into our food products water and air causing cancers birth defects and a host of diseases The government shortlisted about 4000 chemicals that will potentially harm human health or the environment and prioritized 200 of these into 12 batches - we re currently assessing Batch 6 If found to be toxic a chemical placed on the Toxic Substances List is strictly regulated and managed under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act CEPA The disconcerting trend we re seeing is one where less and less chemicals being assessed are making their way on to the Toxic Substances List with just one of the 14 to make the list in Batch 6 Industry and government do not appear willing to produce the much-needed missing information on how these chemicals may enter the environment and worse still they are using this lack of data as a lack of proof to justify keeping potentially toxic chemicals off of the Toxic Substances List That 's why we re sounding the alarm bells at Health Canada and Environment Canada on toxic chemicals and the precautionary principle Precautionary means that instead of using the current gaps in knowledge to justify keeping chemicals off the federal list this principle places the burden of proof on industry to show how these chemicals will not harm human or environmental health Ecojustice helped establish the precautionary principle in Canada at the Supreme Court back in 2001 and we re working to ensure that this responsible approach comes through in the way Canada protects its citizens from dangerous chemicals CEPA clearly outlines how the precautionary principle should guide government 's thinking and our challenge to Environment and Health Canada is to focus on this principle in their decisions that have vast implications for our health and our future Sometimes all it takes is some information and outrage to make meaningful change in our community It 's happening near Sudbury Ontario where Simon Lake Community Stewardship is taking up the cause of sewage dumping in their community - moved to action as a result of our latest water quality report Flushing Out the Truth Sewage Dumping in Ontario Their letter-writing campaign targets Ontario Minister of Environment John Gerretsen with the message that dumping untreated and under-treated sewage into our watersheds is not acceptable These disgusting yet all-too-common events have become standard practice in municipalities as noted in our report In both 2006 and 2007 raw or undertreated sewage was dumped more than 1 000 times by Ontario municipalities The quantities are staggering with billions of litres escaping full treatment each year We pride ourselves on our report-writing rigour and when they inform and inspire communities to stand up for their rights we are doubly pleased If you re in the Sudbury area support their campaign with a letter of your own For those outside of Sudbury see our report to find out how your community is doing when it comes to responsible sewage treatment and let us know your thoughts When it comes to endangered species we re looking for ways to avoid the litigation as law enforcement model we ve had to take to get action for the most vulnerable organisms and ecosystems in Canada One big step forward would be better provincial laws for endangered species and in British Columbia there is hope that may just happen The feds already have a law the Species at Risk Act though we ve consistently needed to take them to court to implement each incremental step the Act requires to protect species and their habitat And federal law does not apply automatically on provincial land except to aquatic species and migratory birds but most land in Canada is provincial only a minority of species are aquatic or migratory birds Meanwhile most provinces have yet to introduce legal protections for species and the habitat they depend on - greatly reducing our chances of ensuring that these species survive let alone recover That might be changing in British Columbia where we re seeing talk that may lead to a meaningful species at risk law Thanks in part to a multi-year effort by Ecojustice and our coalition partners highlighting the need for such a law the BC government announced plans in its August Throne speech to create a Species-at-Risk Task Force The team will be tasked with developing a new vision for endangered species protection in collaboration with the people of BC and Ecojustice will be watching closely to see that this initiative delivers a much-needed endangered species law as of now the task force is yet to be created BC is Canada 's richest province biologically but already at least 43 % of BC 's +3800 species are at risk of disappearing With a successful task force and a new provincial law we can end the current death watch of endangered species in BC and provide a model for the rest of Canada This morning at 9 45 a m we received word that we won our Supreme Court case concerning the Red Chris mine We ve been waiting for this ruling since we presented our case last October and it 's a monumental victory for us for the environment and for public participation that will benefit Canadians for years to come The Court ruled that the Canadian government violated the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act when it split the project into artificially small parts to avoid a comprehensive assessment and public consultation Despite the significant environmental risks posed by this mine the Department of Fisheries and Oceans and Natural Resources Canada limited their assessment to a fraction of the mine proposal removing the actual mine from its environmental review and rubber-stamping a provincial assessment The Court has ruled that in the future the public must now be consulted about major industrial projects such as large metal mines and tar sands developments The Supreme Court has given Canadians back their voice and with it their ability to influence major industrial development across the country said Ecojustice lawyer Lara Tessaro who represented MiningWatch Canada on the case This landmark decision confirms that the government can no longer shirk the environmental protection duties that Parliament has assigned to it The proposed Red Chris mine is located near the Sacred Headwaters the birthplace of Northern BC 's three greatest salmon rivers the Stikine Nass and the Skeena Called the Serengeti of the North for its rich biodiversity the area 's wildlife and waterways are severely threatened by the project Most shocking of all the mine seeks to wipe out pristine Black Lake by converting it into a tailings impoundment area a dumpsite for toxic mine waste And while the ruling did not stop the Red Chris mine from going forward contrary to some industry reports this does not mean that the mine has been approved Ecojustice and Mining watch will continue to follow the project throughout the future federal permitting process and will oppose any permits that threaten our lakes and rivers or that risk the health of the Sacred Headwaters area In the meantime we have successfully secured stronger environmental accountability for future projects throughout the country We ll continue to fight the Canadian government policy of turning lakes into tailings dumps in BC and across the country Thanks to this win our efforts will be even more successful in the future The Globe and Mail recently wrote that it may only be a matter of time before the battle over global warming moves into a courtroom In fact Ecojustice has already taken it there and we re now waiting to hear if our case Canada 's first global warming lawsuit will be heard by the Supreme Court of Canada Our landmark legal challenge argues that the Harper government is breaking Canadian law by failing to comply with the Kyoto Protocol Implementation Act ( KPIA ) Despite being passed in 2007 the government has ignored the Act and failed to enact the legally binding climate change regulations it calls for Meanwhile the Conservative 's plan to a ress climate change doesn t come close to reaching the greenhouse gas targets that we have committed to achieving Given Harper 's repeated reference to our climate change obligations as unrealistic and unachievable it 's not surprising that we have weak reduction targets and industry-friendly standards in the place of leadership action or regulation The Harper government 's lack of regard for this law combined with reports of their obstructionist tactics at last month 's Copenhagen talks leaves Canada wide open to harsh criticism from governments groups and citizens taking action on the climate crisis we will see what our top court has to say about this disregard in the coming months We ll keep the climate cases solutions and results coming in the new year - looks like we have our work cut out for us We were in court yesterday taking a hard look at Ontario 's approaches to land use planning and sustainable development - particularly decision-making at the Ontario Municipal Board ( OMB ) The case involves a proposed golf course and condo development slated for the highly-sensitive Oak Ridges Moraine The 120-acre development has already been rejected by the local municipality but that matter is being challenged by the developers at the OMB At risk is the integrity of the Oak Ridges Moraine itself and good environmental decision-making in general We are there with our client Earthroots to ensure that challenges such as this one are heard by both the OMB and the Environmental Review Tribunal ( ERT ) convening a hearing panel together as a joint board Green-leaning Ontarians have witnessed the developer-friendly atmosphere created by the OMB in the past and have seen some very questionable decisions where efforts to promote local and environmental values have been lost Environmental decision-making expertise in this province is found at the ERT and in matters where planning and environment meet a consolidated OMB / ERT hearing can better assess land use disputes with a greater eye towards sustainable development There 's a public interest in joining together land use and environmental protection decisions avoiding multiple hearings on a single project and integrating the land use issues with the ecosystem and drinking water source concerns posed by this proposed new development A decision on whether or not this challenge will go forward at the OMB alone or a as consolidated OMB / ERT hearing should be made in the next several weeks we ll keep you updated as the results come in As Canadian kids of the Christmas persuasion impatiently eye the boxes beneath the tree it 's good to know that our hard work on product safety will translate into better protection for them from toxic chemicals in their toys and our homes Coming on the heels of the proposed ban for the toxic substance DecaBDE in electronics we helped achieve earlier this year in Canada the US EPA announced last week that several American companies are following in our footsteps by phasing out the manufacturing of this prevalent but highly toxic fire retardant DecaBDE is used in everything from video game consoles and TVs to drapes and furniture It accumulates in breast milk fish and birds to cause liver thyroid and developmental problems in humans and wildlife The voluntary decision by these companies is to be applauded and we are glad to see that Ecojustice 's senior scientist Dr Elaine MacDonald was out in front on this issue Given this announcement by the chemical companies that make DecaBDE Ecojustice will ask Canada to broaden its proposed ban on DecaBDE from electronics to a total ban on all uses DecaBDE We re also pushing hard to keep the lead-ri en kids toys off the Canadian market by making science- and legally-based submissions supporting a strong and effective Bill C-6 the Canada Consumer Product Safety Act It 's encouraging to see Canada leading a forward-thinking and precautionary approach towards environmental and human health As the feds implement their deca ban in electronics and the House considers C6 's product monitoring and enforcement changes we ll continue to hold our leaders accountable on behalf of the public Look forward to hearing more about our toxics research and legal actions in the new year Have a happy and healthy holiday 
If you re familiar with my last AER9 you ll recall that the project was completed in only 4 days I recently had a chance to take another whack at it with a much more lenient deadline and I 'm very very happy with the results The basic steps at the beginning were the same as my last build Make a blueprint transcribe it to wood and start cutting gluing and clamping I did discover a random and somewhat neat trick for scribing the lines on this though By printing to vellum on an injket printer I was able to directly transfer the pattern of the print from the paper to the wood Using laquer thinner brushed over the ink I burnished the paper against the MDF and the lines transferred perfectly Made transcribing my blueprints MUCH easier The main difference between this build and my last is the materials used Outside of the stock base barrel grip and MF cell all other parts were made from sintra styrene or aluminum These materials can take detail much better than MDF which afforded me a lot of control in making the shape more accurate I also decided to use LEDs for a glowing barrel effect This was a preliminary test-fire to see how the idea would work In the end I used the lens out of a laser pointer behind the center hole in the barrel to focus the light and make it brighter in that spot After the barrel and stock were shaped to the correct dimensions I started a ing details in sintra amp styrene The rounded edges on the back and front parts were made by gluing the sintra into a box and rounding the edges on my table router Another huge difference in this build was my new lathe The AER9 has a TON of little rounded bits all over it These were cut out of MDF or sintra The microfusion cell is 4 pieces of MDF glued together and shaped on the lathe as well This rear knob is also lathed MDF The tube which sits on top of the barrel is an ABS rod This was a lot easier to shape than the 5 /16 's teel tube I used on the last build Here 's most of the parts going on for a test fit The grip is an MDF block with sintra strips shaped over it To keep a uniform shape I heat-formed one sheet over the entire grip then cut it into strips on my bandsaw The rear of the barrel is a sintra box with styrene accents The curved part behind the MF cell was sculpted out of apoxie sculpt and sanded to shape Various other smaller bits were shaped out of sintra / styrene before going to primer Below is the trigger amp trigger arm MF cell area barrel cell eject lever and other bits I also scribed the panel lines on the parts with a lino block carving tool I had left over from my art school days Another test assembly after all the parts had been primed I had some really tight tolerances when putting it together as the layers of paint actually made it quite hard to get the front and rear casings over the barrel Yay precision To power the LEDs I used 2 AA batteries housed in an in-line battery holder The knob on the back of the gun unscrews to reveal the battery door to replace the cells I was very very happy with how this turned out The LEDs are switched on and off by a hi en pushbutton switch on the bottom of the rifle barrel The last lathed part was the bottom support bar This was carved from a pine dowel and cored out to receive a hollow aluminum bar Styrene accents finished it off I also found some knurled nuts to use for the two circular parts on the support bar and JB welded them in place On to paint The basecoat silver was done with Krylon chrome paint After this I dusted the surface with a darker silver by holding the can about 2 feet away from the part and spraying lightly over the entire surface This gave the paint a stippled texture like cast aluminum would have ( this is shown a little better on the front barrel casing in the shot below with the barrel painted green ) Color was done with Testors spray paint for the barrel ( which is annoyingly thin and loves to run ) and Testors brush paint for the silver on the MF cell and upper pipe After this each individual part got a coat of clear to protect the finish I know I 'm going to get a ton of decal questions so I hope this answers them preemptively It seems like custom decals are the bane of every replica maker and it took me a bit to figure out the best way to do it as well As with my Portal Gun the AER9 got water-slide decals on the MF cell for the warning messages arrows and stripe These were designed in Adobe Photoshop and printed onto water-slide decal paper on a laserjet printer The barrel decals were done differently The barrel was scanned on a computer scanner to pick up the color amp texture of the paint Then I designed the side decals in Illustrator taking them into Photoshop to layer them over the green background and weather them a bit before printing These were output on adhesive-backed vinyl using a plotter then applied to the gun There is a slight seam line around the sides of these but its only evident under close inspection Here 's the gun all assembled and shiny brand-new So pretty so clean So needs a few coats of grime This was the first pass Another new tool I had for this build was an airbrush I d never used one before so this was as much a practice run as it was a weathering effort It took some getting used to but I was very satisfied with the results NOTE If you don t seal inkjet decals before acrylic paint weathering they will run amp bleed This is why I clearcoated the gun before this process I also made a display board for the gun to sit on in maple This was stained satin black Here 's the final shots of the gun after all the weathering was completed and given another coat of clear to protect the finish I am very glad I got to revisit this piece but I don t think I ll be making another one 2 was plenty for me and its time to try another project with my newfound techniques and materials These pics and more build images are all available on my flickr page in much higher resolutions Thanks for reading New year new projects new deadlines And if I 'm honest some old deadlines from last year too Here 's a few of the projects that I ve got on various burners that will be featured in the coming months AER9 Laser Rifle ( Fallout 3 ) Thats right I 'm doing this again The last one was a very rushed build and I would have loved to have more time to get the details to my liking On this project I can I learned a lot from the first AER9 and all of that trial-by-fire will be applied to this project Things are moving fast so I may have a finished product very soon Among the improvements are a moving trigger screenprinted labels and an illuminated barrel Force-a-Nature ( Team Fortress 2 ) This project is also moving quickly though I wish I d taken more pictures of the process The proportions of this gun are ridiculous - the barrels hold a 4 gauge round and are only 7 25 long This will be a heavy and robust piece when completed I have a neat collaboration going on with a fellow who is maching some aluminum parts for it too can t wait to show those off Chell 's Heelsprings ( Portal ) These poor things have been sitting in 90 % limbo for a while now awaiting a few minor bits to make them perfect We have a Portal photoshoot coming up in the near future so hopefully they will be back on the table soon Link 's Hylian Shield ( Zelda Twilight Princess ) My first shield was also my first real prop When I first took a crack at this the entire shape was eyeballed and I didn t know my materials very well On top of that I didn t take any progress photos This shield will rectify a lot of the issues of the old one mostly the major inaccuracies and cumbersome weight of my first project All this and more in 2010 Thanks for reading We did it After two months of back-and-forth with the PR reps at the Georgia Aquarium we were allowed to bring Big Da y in for a photoshoot This was a colossal effort and just like the original display of the piece several hands went into making it happen Much thanks to my friend Kim and Jay for getting up at 5am to come with us and be our handlers to the Georgia Aquarium staff for this amazing opportunity and to Matt

these pictures were taken in the Ocean Voyager and Tropical Diver 's ections of the Georgia Aquarium They do offer private photoshoots for individuals and businesses and they take place before business hours so you can have a crowd-free session Our photoshoot took place between 8 and 10am so we didn t disturb the normal flow of customer traffic If you want to contact the Georgia Aquarium about doing a private photoshoot of your own check out this form There were divers cleaning the insides of the tanks when we first arrived and as we began our shoot some of them started to crowd around and look at what was taking place Definitely an o experience when you re the one being looked at from the inside of the fish tank Its easy to see the biggest change in the suit LEDs I a ed light diffusion panels to the dome of the Big Da y for this shoot and I 'm very glad I did I also a ed foam pa ing around the shoulders hips and knees in order to fill out the suit a bit more and prevent that stick-like effect that showed up in some of the photography from DragonCon As with before I owe all the sewing credit to my fiancée Emily She 's also the creepy-as-hell Little Sister in

WOW I have been getting a TON of requests / inquiries about the Daft Punk helmet Most of these emails have very similar questions so I figured I d make a quick Q amp A post that I can reference which will hopefully answer everyone at once If you don t want to read all the copy below I don t blame you I do tend to ramble Summary Currently I cannot recreate these with a zero margin of error I have gone through several casts in order to get one with a perfect finish to send along to my client I do not believe in selling my work to someone unless it is flawless and as of now there are still issues with this process Due to this I cannot take any orders for replicas of finished helmets Q Is the helmet for sale A No this helmet was built for a client of mine and was constructed specifically for him Unless he wants to sell it ( not likely ) it is not available for purchase Q Will you make me a helmet / are there other replicas you re willing to sell A There are 2 parts to this answer Firstly I am currently booked until April and cannot take any commissions in May or June due to my we ing and honeymoon Any work I do is purely first-come first-served and I am not taking commission reservations at this time When I open up again to take reservations for 2010 I will post on here Projects will very likely fill up quickly so look out for updates in December / January Secondly there are not currently any copies available for sale and I cannot definitively say there ever will be At this time there are still issues with chroming the plastic helmets Also I don t have a continued source for visor vacuum-forming I do not own my own vac-forming machine and BlindSquirrel did the first run as a favor to me He has plenty of his own work to see to and I do not want to impose on him to continue these for me The short answer is this I am only making 2 finished helmets One for me and one for my client That is all there will be until April If someone is interested in another one be sure to check back on my blog in December / January for when I will be taking reservations again Q Will you make / Have you made Thomas helmet A I have not but plans are in the works This build will start in mid 2010 Again like above please note that the initial helmet will be made for my client ONLY Any other requests will follow my standard commission queue Q How much will a finished helmet cost with the LED effects A During the course of this project it has become remarkably apparent to me as to why the real helmets fetch a 64 000 price This stuff is intricate finicky and expensive I do not disclose client final pricing on projects but I can say that certain things carried a hefty price tag Custom PCBs for the lighting run about 250 / helmet the LEDs themselves cost 150 / helmet and the electrical components ( Arduino board transistors resistors plugs wires etc etc etc ) totaled over 300 That alone is 700 and thats just materials cost for blinking lights I hope that gives some idea of the scope of the rest of the project Q Can I buy a raw cast from the mold to make a helmet on my own A EDIT I AM TAKING A BREAK FROM OFFERING RESIN HELMETS The mold has started to show some wear after making 25 copies and I also need time to finish other projects Resin copies are now on hold indefinitely Q Can I have your schematics / plans / illustrations / research notes A On some scale yes My schematics are included in my client 's budget this is the case with all of my builds Their payments cover the time in research and drawing of these plans If you like I can provide you with hi-res eps pdf or ai files to help you in your build for a small fee Keep in mind that typically these blueprints are the result of several hours of research and planning then even more time drawing I hope that answers some of the questions I ve been getting about the helmet and I truly am appreciative of all the attention its been getting If I had the ability to make one for every person who has asked I would However I am only one guy working in his spare time at home I can t possibly take orders for dozens of replicas and I 'm just plain uneasy about booking out time way too far in advance To everyone who has asked me about these replicas Thank You for your interest and your support of my work Again I really wish I could help out all the people who have sent me inquiries but one guy can only do so much Finally because I hate posts without pictures here 's a few images to tide everyone over until I can send out some finished shots of the helmet in all its blinking glory And one teaser video I ll explain all of these in the next entry of the Daft Punk helmet saga Part 3 Electronics EDIT For information regarding replicas of this prop please see THIS POST In the last post I had about this build I ended with the finished master ready for molding Silicone silicone silicone Layered in stages with registration keys and marks for the mother mold The mother mold was made with Plasti-paste In retrospect this makes for a very heavy mold that gives you some sore shoulders after slushcasting and fiberglass may have been a better idea At least its sturdy The detail captured in the silicone was perfect Some resin pulls I started off with smoothcast 320 but it proved difficult to make a nice thin pull After switching to smoothcast 300 things got a bit more to my liking Couldn t help walking around in one I trimmed out a casting of the visor to make the vacuum-former mold for the visors This was mounted to a flat board so PETG plastic could be pulled over it Ear areas were trimmed out for the LEDs and black plate that sits in the cones The trimmed and sanded helmets were given a coat of primer and wet sanded to take out any minor imperfections in the resin surface I need to take a minute aside here to go on a personal rant and I apologize in advance for that because the last thing I want my blog to become is my own personal soapbox This project is a large and complex one and due to that there were certain things I had to farm out to other vendors and craftsmen Specifically the chrome gold plating of the resin and the vacuum-forming of the visors I don t possess the tooling to do either of these so I had to look elsewhere Metalizing Initially I had planned on going to M amp M Metalizing for my gold chrome work Over the phone estimates placed the process at 125 per helmet I agreed and sent two of the ones you see above ( wetsanded and prepped ) for finishing The day after sending the package and an email confirming they were en route with tracking number I received a phonecall from M amp M The price had risen to 175 per helmet without much in the way of explanation I was in a bind an under a deadline and I agreed The day the package was arrived I got another call saying that gold plating carried an a itional 25 surcharge per part This increased my original price of 250 for 2 helmets to now 400 plus return shipping Angry I requested they be shipped to another company for plating M amp M then charged me ( COD with no invoice ) 100 for 2-day return shipping Next-day air had cost me 46 less than a week before This is the condition the helmets arrived in at the other shop You can see the damage to certain areas noted by the arrows ( larger version here ) The helmets were not packaged in the box merely thrown on top of the wrapping I had sent previously ( they had been sent out by me wrapped very carefully in foam and bubble wrap to prevent the above from happening ) A itionally the helmets themselves were greasy with fingerprints and other oils which would have caused major imperfections in the finish I offer this story as an caution and hopefully warnings like this will come infrequently to anyone who reads these posts of mine looking for similar processes As someone who relies very heavily on reputation in order to have a continued supply of business I don t see how anyone can operate in this manner My contact there was generally abrasive on the phone and obviously cared very little for my continued patronage Vacuum-forming Mike ( BlindSquirrel ) a fellow prop builder over at My Dumb Projects took care of the vac-forming for me Mike is a fantastic guy an amazing craftsman and his work on this project well exceeded my expectations Actually his patience was the best part as my mold proved to be a frustrating piece of kit to work with ( mostly because I didn t know how to build a proper vacuum-former mold ) Eventually he worked out the kinks with stellar results The visor was tinted on the inside with car tail-light paint called VHT Nightshades The result is a nearly opaque outer appearance but only a tinting similar to dark sunglasses from the inside This visor like the rest of the helmet in this post is a test piece You ll notice some webbing in the PET plastic in the images No sense testing the tint on a shiny perfect piece The back wire hair is a test piece for now built with pieces I have laying about from other various projects The actual plastic dome is built from the excess resin used trimmed out of the visor area Currently the colors are incorrect but this is just a proof of theory piece New Chrome The gold plating done in these shots was completed by E7 Technologies and is a process called Cosmichrome While we re still getting some small issues worked out this is a very cool technique The people at E7 are everything that M amp M are not They have helped me and been very accommodating through the entire process and have been willing to run test pieces for me in order to achieve the best result The images below are a shot of the dud helmet which had too much orangepeel and issues with the finish to be called a success Neat video of the chroming process Part three should be the final chapter in this build with everything coming together Look for it around Halloween Still to come EDIT I 'm currently working on a bit of a redesign here Apologies of the site looks like crap for a little while A commission came to me very very last minute for a good friend of mine He was planning on doing a Vault Dweller costume from Fallout 3 and needed a weapon in a month Unfortunately I had other commissions deadlines and large projects to finish in that span of time I looked at my schedule decided I could shave off some sleep and promised him 30 hours of build time What follows is the result of that hurried errand First as always I put together some blueprints These are fairly low-detail but work well for the scope of what I 'm doing with this build After this build was about 80 % finished I was pointed in the direction of currently-existing and much better and more accurate blueprints but thats a story for when I take on this project again in the future and give it the proper time it deserves In order to save time my friend came over and traced my blueprints onto MDF I taught him how to use a bandsaw ( nothing like a crash course in something that can leave you fingerless ) and he went to town rough-cutting the shapes I d refine later into the gun Here 's where we started Impressive right I had a sick idea of just scotch-taping all these together painting the whole thing silver and handing it to him the day of the convention but I 'm not that mean Ignore the lighter pieces near the bottom - those are part of another build After cleaning up the cuts on a belt sander I began the assembly of the main body in the 2 most prominent parts - the square barrel and the rear stock These are both made from 1 /2 MDF The barrel has a few sections cut out for the microfusion cell and a space for the rear stock and lower receiver to mount I used a table router to re-shape the holes in the stock and bevel the edges This was also a low-budget build so I didn t have the liberty of going out and buying fancy new holesaws The lower support rod was made out of varying sized of pine dowel threaded over a 1 /4 aluminum bar The front grip was made from 2 pieces of 3 /4 MDF screwed together and shaped on a belt sander Styrene will eventually make up the grip texture The microfusion cell was pieced together from some pre-existing elements I had a small dome mold that I 'm using on another project that happened to be pretty close I pulled two of these and epoxied them around some 2 PVC pipe MDF discs were affixed to the main body to make the housing around the cell At this point it started to resemble the final product This is about 6 hours into the build ( Yes I 'm using build as a noun Colloquial English take that grammar sticklers ) Styrene was a ed to the lower grip as well as the cell eject lever and front barrel area for the raised textures The upper barrel pipe was made out of 3 /8 's teel pipe This terminates into a lathed pine dowel glued to the barrel corner If you re wondering why some of these shots are so dark recall that the extra time I found to build this came when I should have been sleeping The bulk of this project was done between 10pm and 1am on most days After a coat of primer and some sanding I started scribing panel lines with a dremel tool and a ing screw recesses around the front of the barrel Other details were a ed in MDF around the cell loading chamber and the rear part of this area was faired down into the barrel of the gun with apoxie sculpt I also a ed the raised pucks on the grip and stock Recessed areas were drilled into the gun and filled with countersunk phillips screws More styrene and MDF pieces were a ed to the barrel and rear area of the gun to build up the details in these areas The shapes of these were largely improvised as by this point I only had 4 days left until my deadline with many other projects that needed completing After this the whole gun received a coat of gray primer to seal the remaining exposed wood The first coat of paint went on shortly after the above finished drying I used Krylon hammered silver followed by a coat of Testor 's Olive Drab on the main barrel Fortunately for me these guns are supposed to be 200 + years old in the Fallout 3 universe That means its time for my favorite thing of all heavy weathering The basecoat of weathering was done with acrylic paints and matte gel medium I did an initial coat of black followed by browns and greens to simulate dirt and corrosion After this dried I gave the whole piece drybrush silver accents to simulate wear and tear from the wastelands chipping away at the paint and caked-on dirt The finished piece has a nice shimmer to the metallic silver drybrush which simulates metal rather well Finally some more shots of the finished product from a few different angles I 'm still looking for a good way to transfer my vector decals to the gun I tried water-slide as with my Portal gun build but yellow ink on top of dark green showed up very poorly There are a lot of details missing from the final product so I want to return to this prop someday and build it without such an insane time restriction I really wish I could have given this project a bit more time and been more dedicated to the intricate detail this gun has but for a 4 day build this turned out better than I could have hoped Happy Super Mutant Hunting Wait you know I had this whole thing written out and then I went to preview the blog entry and something just didn t look right The rifle was weathered but it still looked too clean on that white background The graphics of the Fallout games do a good job of making the weapons look blackened but I felt like this needed a bit more I went back after thinking about it and decided to a some rust to the AER9 The shots above is how the gun was delivered and shown at the convention Here 's how it sits now And just for the hell of it a modified version of one shot in the Fallout 3 graphic style ( Higher res pic HERE and more high-res shots of the build process available on my flickr page ) Ok NOW we re done I finally lost my mind enough to try to tackle one of these big guys For those unfamiliar Big Da ys are the protectors of the Little Sisters in Rapture an underwater city devoid of morality which has degenerated into chaos and insanity They are huge fast strong and as it turns out a solid pain in the ass to build I 'm going to break with tradition for a sec and show you the finished product first This is a long long long post that details nearly 7 solid weeks of work and you guys deserve to know that the long post is quite necessary and ( I think ) well worth the read Credit goes to 's cenemissingmagazine on Flickr for this amazing photograph ( High-rez shot here ) So here 's how I did it First thing 's first I needed blueprints I built these in Illustrator based off some very good reference images that the guys at 2K published in their artbooks Since this is such a large project I ll break down the build process into partitions The main body the dome the drill arm the dome cage other details and the final paintwork The Main Body Starting with the blueprints printed at full scale ( HUGE ) I made cross sections out of insulation foam and glued them into place The empty areas between sections were filled with cardboard This formed what I called the 's keleton of the body The empty cavities in the skeleton were then filled in with expanding foam After drying the foam was carved into the shape of the main body After this was completed ( and the foam given more drying time so it would retain its shape ) the entire form was covered in stretch fabric This smoothed out a lot of the lumpiness of the foam Accent areas around the arms legs and top of the body were made out of insulation foam then glued to the body Before coating with paint or fiberglass resin these were covered with Ureshell to prevent the poly foam from dissolving Certain areas on the body itself were also given a coat of Ureshell so they would not disintegrate After this was dry the entire body piece was given several applications of fiberglass resin The front flap was a ed using more insulation foam and also given a coat of Ureshell and resin After this was dry I began hollowing out the foam and cardboard After a ing some details on the body with foam tape more ureshell and more resin I had a finished form The Dome I started with a 24 's moked security camera dome off of eBay This came from a demolished shopping center and are actually hard to track down these days given the much smaller size of most security cameras I remember these all over the place as a kid I was sent two of them for some reason so if anyone wants the second one just let me know After trimming the square edge off I cut a disc from insulation foam to serve as the ring around the dome I made resin copies of wingnuts which were glued into place on the trim ring About 15 of these resin duplicates weighed as much as a single wingnut Since I had to wear this thing every ounce saved counted For the portholes I made a single master out of PVC and MDF wood which I molded in silicone The portholes were all slush-cast to save weight and time in production Also this way they re completely identical The tape here is marking the spacing of the portholes After coating the dome in resin to thicken it a bit I trimmed the porthole-holes with a dremel The dome was a very brittle acrylic so this was a nerve-wracking process The drill arm Unfortunately since this project was done in such a hurry my process photography was somewhat lacking The drill started out as an aluminum rod with 4 triangles of matteboard affixed to it Rings of foam were made around the matteboard then paper layered on top of that to create the cone shape The actual blade of the drill bit is made from masking tape which has been layered in small sections to follow the curve of the drill sides This piece was coated in several layers of fiberglass resin (s ome with tinting to check coverage ) To create a really worn look I a ed bits of debris to the fiberglass resin This made a convincing textured metal finish in the end as these parts were painted to look like rust dents and bits of splicer A PVC cage and old DeWalt 12V cordless drill make up the support frame and motor for the drill I moved the battery inside the body of the suit to save on weight hanging from my arms The housing for this mechanism was made from a concrete tube electrical conduit PVC and more foam tape This was painted in ureshell to protect it during painting as well as to give it texture The Dome Cage This was constructed mainly out of PVC electrical conduit This pipe is gray in color and takes heat and bending much better than standard white PVC tubing I bought 40 feet of it for this project and ended up using about 35 At only 88 /10 feet though this was an easy buy The sides terminate into 3 PVC couplers These slide over 3 PVC pipe anchored to the body that has been notched to be a sightly smaller diameter than 3 Since the wearer has to enter through the front porthole the dome as well as the cage must be removable The front of the cage is friction-fit at the top and bottom anchorpoints as well as the sides so it can easily be put on and taken off A quick test of the body dome and cage This is after the dome has had all portholes carved out and secured Other Details An animatronic hand and arm extension were created for the left side of the suit This would help prevent the 's tubby arm look I ve seen on other Big Da y suit builds The rear tank was made from a 12 concrete tube with foam plugs on the top and bottom carved to a dome shape The bands around the tank were made with foam tape coated in Ureshell I made a pushmold of some bolt heads for texture these were cast in resin and a ed to the tank as well as the banding on the main body Boltheads and a first coat of paint on the tank The wheel at the top is a cake decoration from our local supermarket The boots were made from more insulation foam These give me about 6 of lift and make the feet look proportional to the rest of Big Da y I got this i 
On pages 8-9 of Moral Panics and the Copyright Wars I discuss the aftermath of the shutdown of Napster in 2001 This period is interesting because it presented the music industry with something of a crossroads Napster had demonstrated there was a huge potential market for digital distribution of singles I use the word potential because the trick was converting the free Napster model into a paying one I use crossroads because there were two fundamental choices either (1) ignore this potential market in the hope that if it was shut off ( by having enjoined illegal services and by not offering legal alternatives ) the industry could go back to things the way they were that is selling CDs or (2) realizing that the market for digital singles was the future and had to be served This latter choice by the way did not mean ending the immediate sale of CDs but it did mean that the industry would have itself have participated in the offering of a product (s ingles ) that made CDs less attractive For an industry that is so big on control one would have thought that the rational choice was to at least participate in the new market at its inception and thereby have some measure of control over the phasing out of one product as the next takes over As I noted on page 5 of Moral Panics Ruth Handler co-founder of Mattel and creator of the Barbie doll observe dAnyone can manage the upside cycle The secret is managing a product down its life cycle properly And all products have life cycles suing tens of thousands of your customers may fend off the inevitable decline for a short period of time but the cycle will win because one thing copyright infringement actions can never do is make people buy a product they do not want The record industry 's failure to adapt to the next product digital singles was suicidal There is controversy over how the decision not to jump into the digital singles market took place that is whether there were collusive efforts to impede the new market I have no special knowledge on this and therefore have to rely on published sources whose accuracy is also in question but by not taking the rational option -- serving the new market -- the industry left the market to be served illegally ( and I use illegally deliberately in place of the less judgmental word unauthorized ) The industry didn t sit back entirely though two online services were eventually created MusicNet and PressPlay These services were doomed to fail though because they each only offered music from their respective label partners because the pricing was high DRM laden etc As I note on pages 9-10 of Moral Panics the Department of Justice began investigating allegations that the major labels had designed MusicNet and PressPlay to impede the growth of authorized distribution of music on the Internet through refusing to issue licenses and by refusing to offer genuinely attractive services of their own The D of J closed the investigation without taking action In a spin off of the original Napster case the VC firm Hummer Winblad ( a defendant at that point ) detailed allegations that the labels had withheld critical information from the D of J Judge Patel required the labels to turn over to Hummer Winblad documents which HW alleged the labels had withheld from the D of J After this order was issued the case against HW was settled so we never had the chance to see if the conspiracy theory was of the space alien variety or not (S ee pages 9-10 of Moral Panics ) We may get a second shot though Yesterday the Second Circuit issued an opinion in a separate antitrust case over price fixing by MusicNet and PressPlay The court of appeals reversed dismissal of the case by the trial judge The court of appeals ruling lets the case and therefore discovery go forward Much in the opinion concerns the general pleading standard in the wake of the Supreme Court 's opinion in Bell Atlantic Corp v Twombly 550 U S 544 (2007) and in letting the case go forward the court of appeals did not pass on the merits of the allegations instead holding that the allegations met the Twombly standard to survive a 12 ( b )( 6 ) motion to dismiss The allegations do provide some information on the post-Napster period though The court of appeals notes that in the post-Napster period in order to obtain music from all the labels would have required consumers to subscribe to both services at a cost then of 240 a year What did one get for the 240 Each year consumers were required to pay up again or else all the music they had purchased would have been blocked songs couldn t be transferred to other devices like iPods and the DRM ( which the court describes as unpopular ) prohibited consumers from copying more than two songs from any artist The court quoted an industry commentator who accurately concluded at the time that nobody in their right mind will want to use the two services (S lip opn page 4 ) The court also focused on the pricing of the services noting that while many of the hard costs associated with CDs were dramatically reduced with CDs these dramatic cost reductions were not accompanied by dramatic price reductions for Internet Music as would be expected in a competitive market (S lip opn page 4 ) To the contrary the complaint alleges that there were parallel prices increases enforced through MFN clauses that were contained in secret side agreements (S lip opn at 12 ) The case is one to follow hopefully for the light it will shed into actual behind the scenes practices during a critical period Postscript Ann Garrett has written me to correct a number of mistakes in the post regarding MusicNet Here with permission are her comments (T hanks Ann ): Mr Patry in your blog Moral Panics and the Copyright Wars related to the entry on Jan 14 MusicNet Pressplay and Lost Opportunities your premise two online services were eventually created MusicNet and PressPlay These services were doomed to fail As for MusicNet there never was a service MusicNet (d ba MediaNet ) was and still is a platform that aggregates and distributes premium digital content to companies creating music-centric apps and services online retail destinations or a ing music content to web sites The notion that the record companies agreed to launch two competing services that excluded content fixed prices and ultimately failed makes a compelling narrative You ll recall that this storyline was first written about eight years ago and since then has been repeated over and over again until it has become urban legend But it has little to do with the actual history of MusicNet Without going into too much detail on that history here are some key points MusicNet was incubated at Real Networks which was its largest shareholder Two labels subsequently came in as investors WMG and EMI Bertelsmann made an investment as well but this ended up hurting our relationship with the record company BMG which had minimal contact and didn t seem to get along with the Bertelsmann guys A New York-based private equity company bought out all the original investors and became the sole shareholder of MusicNet ( today known as MediaNet ) Negotiating licenses with all the majors indies and aggregators was a difficult and time-consuming process then and it still is today As a rule of thumb we expect it to take about a year to a each new set of rights - subscriptions download sales on-demand streams etc The available content expanded from about 100 000 tracks nine years ago to ten million plus today but there were key hurdles along the way o Record companies had an extremely difficult time initially clearing digital rights with their artists No sooner did we a Dave Mathews than his lawyer demanded we take it down until his label RCA records negotiated an a itional advance for exploitation of digital rights High profile artists like Metallica had full control of their distribution and wouldn t agree to make their catalogs available Some artists agreed to offer their repertoire for download sales but not subscriptions and vice versa Many tracks were in dispute because the artist had changed labels and the labels were subsequently consolidated under new companies or the content was part of a compilation or in the case of urban music samples from other artists were used extensively Through a long deliberate process we have whittled down the high profile hold-outs to the Beatles AC / DC and a handful of others o Publishing clearances were a nightmare It was only last year that the CRB came up with a statutory rate and licensing and payment standards o Recorded music was mostly limited to a million or so major label and key indie tracks compared to the many millions available today This has been due to incredible growth among Indie labels and music aggregators The rumors of our demise have been greatly exaggerated MusicNet continues to be the most important digital service provider in the industry Over the years we have powered every major brand from Yahoo and Microsoft in the US to Tesco and HMV in the UK and Samsung in Germany amp France Our last quarter was our best ever and with the launch of our new product line MN Open we expect good results in 2010 MusicNet has never built or marketed a service directly to consumers Retail pricing has always been set by our customers We pass through content costs and charge a transactional fee for our services Should you need more details behind the growth and success of MusicNet (d ba MediaNet ) I am happy to connect you with our longtime CEO Alan McGlade I am hopeful you can clarify MusicNet 's position in your blog entry Best regards Ann Garrett MediaNet There was a time when Netflix had a great business model instead of having to get in your car schlep to the nearest video rental store pay late fees and compete with others for the latest blockbuster movie ( because as the name Blockbuster Video implied there wasn t a lot of anything else ) you could from the comfort of your home order movies to be mailed to your house For a monthly subscription fee you could keep them without paying late fees ( this helped Netflix too by cutting down on its postage costs ) and the selection was also long-tail As a result I rented watched many many more movies than I would have However in the wake of its deal with Warner in which Netflix agreed to a 28 day embargo on renting the latest movies in exchange for reduced DVD purchase costs I have cancelled my subscription Netflix 's new business model is apparently the old business model of businesses first consumers last I expect the new business model will also be bad for Netflix and the studios Instead of watching movies I will do something else Nor does the business model make sense now it assumes that consumers want something -- to rent -- but that the studios by depriving consumers of what they want will be able to force them to do something they don t want to do buy I doubt it I rented movies to watch them once If I couldn t rent them I didn t buy them Why not Because movies are just not important in the larger scheme of life or even the smaller scheme of consumer behavior movies are merely entertainment and usually trivial entertainment that doesn t warrant going out of your way to accommodate a scheme set up to frustrate your desires If I couldn t rent a movie I did something else and usually did that something else first anyway Picking up a book practicing clarinet reading the New Yorker are all perfectly fine and usually better alternatives And if I did want to buy a movie I would do it regardless of whether I could rent it so the idea that the studios and Netflix can get consumers to buy when they only want to rent doesn t make sense to me What does make sense to me is to not give money to those who don t care about offering me what I want and that 's what I have done by cancelling my Netflix subscription not out of spite or anger ( its too trivial to get upset about anyway ) but because its the wrong business model When I was in Geneva two weeks ago I gave a 16 minute video interview to Intellectual Property Watch a Geneva-based publication Here is the link Other than the very beginning where it looks like I am posing for a death mask the interview is I think a good summary of what I was trying to accomplish in writing the book and it contains analysis of how one metaphor (\ a rising tide lifts all boats ) works When I worked for the U S House of Representatives one of my favorite Congressmen was Dan Glickman of Kansas ( Another was Howard Berman ) Mr Glickman along with 34 other Democrats was defeated in the Republican 1994 electoral rout and the following year he became President Clinton 's Secretary of Agriculture where he served with great distinction In 2004 he succeeded Jack Valenti as head of the Motion Picture Association of America -- a hard act for anyone to follow He recently announced he would retire at the end of his contract next year Mr Glickman has always been a sensible person not given to extreme statements and more interested in working through problems than in creating them High-flying rhetoric is out of character For this reason I was surprised by a story in Wired back in late November about a letter he sent to the Senate Judiciary Committee on ACTA It didn t surprise me that MPAA strongly supports ACTA but what did surprise me was the letter 's effort to create a moral panic about those who oppose ACTA In the letter he says Opponents of ACTA are either indifferent to worldwide piracy or actively hostile toward efforts to improve copyright enforcement worldwide Many of them decried the WTO TRIPS agreement when it came into force in the 1990 's and they now insist that any effort to build upon the TRIPS minimum standards for enforcement is anti-consumer and anti-innovation None of those statements are true and there is an unfortunate careless eliding of a number of points to misstate positions The parts of ACTA that are controversial are not the parts that deal with customs and counterfeiting enforcement Aside from some early wild conjectures about the scope of ACTA 's customs proposals caused by the secrecy of the text no one as far as I know has been critical of the very provisions that concern actual enforcement of rights against counterfeiters MPAA is right to want to stamp out such conduct and if improvements in global standards are required we should improve them There is no indifference or hostility on this issue The next part of the statement about opposition to TRIPS is also false I worked on the TRIPS implementing legislation on the House Mr Glickman did not presumably he was rightly focused on the agricultural provisions I am not aware of anyone ( much less 'm any ) who at the time decried the TRIPS provisions on enforcement No one called them anti-consumer or anti-innovation or was hostile or indifferent to counterfeiting Let 's debate the merits of proposals and skip the false rhetoric Today at the WIPO Standing Committee on Copyright and Related Rights in Geneva various statements were introduced by governments on a proposed treaty for the visually impaired In the interest of full disclosure my employer recently submitted to the U S Copyright Office a statement in support of the treaty (S ee here ) A number of developing countries positions were disappointing in their lack of meaningful support of the proposed treaty Certainly if those making statements in actual opposition had available to them the minuscule amount the visually impaired have their views would be quite different Theirs is a failure both of compassion and a failure to recognize the positive role of copyright in furthering access Some apparently are willing to sacrifice the neediest in order to hold on to more than they already deserve It is easy to find reasons not to do something the mark of a generous and compassionate soul is finding reasons to do something In this context I applaud and we all should applaud the statement submitted by United States ( available here ) The statement is the most genuinely balanced and forward-looking U S government document on copyright I have read since the days of the great Registers of Copyrights Abraham Kaminstein and Barbara Ringer Kudos to Justin Hughes head of the U S delegation I quote only the final paragraph but one should read it all We recognize that some in the international copyright community believe that any international consensus on substantive limitations and exceptions to copyright law would weaken international copyright law The United States does not share that point of view The United States is committed to both better exceptions in copyright law and better enforcement of copyright law Indeed as we work with countries to establish consensus on proper basic exceptions within copyright law we will ask countries to work with us to improve the enforcement of copyright This is part and parcel of a balanced international system of intellectual property In my last posting I discussed reviews of the Moral Panics book and my disappointment with a too-common failure to do much more than a USA Today- type superficial nuggets approach I thought it might help to give an example I have chosen the most recent review by Nate Anderson at Ars Technica since neither Nate nor Ars Technica can be considered to opposed to the book 's project and since I am a big fan of the blog which has consistently done excellent work My purpose therefore is not to criticize Nate or Ars Technica but rather to show how even friendly venues can fall short Nate 's review diminishes the book to a series of juicy metaphors which he quotes in bullet points having done so he then characterizes the book as a screed I am described as someone who when once freed from the shackles of legal writing can lob hand grenades with the best of them The reference to bomb throwing of course is itself perfect figurative language for talking about a book about Copyright Wars an irony perhaps Nate appreciates or not I chose the word irony here purposefully because after reducing the book to a series of metaphors Nate comments Not that there 's anything wrong with a good screed in the right hands the screed can be a hugely enjoyable form But there 's a certain irony about the method here The quotes above rely on the most vivid of metaphor in order to discredit what they describe yet this is exactly what Patry spends much of the book accusing Big Content of doing So the book is a series of bomb-throwing and even worse it 's a book about how bad bomb-throwing is I must indeed be a hypocrite There is apparently nothing more to the book so it can easily be dismissed as a screed good or not that falls prey to the very disease it is trying to extirpate Another failed lousy book next story Since the book is 200 pages of text ( not counting footnotes ) there must be an awful lot of bomb-throwing indeed this appears to be all Nate read since he states the tone here gets so one-sided at points that all but the most hardened copyfighter will probably set the book down at some passages scratch the chin and ask Really No examples of this are given but we get the point from the bullet-point list of choice metaphors the book is page after relentless page of metaphoric attacks on copyright owners No doubt this makes for an easy review but it is a false characterization of the book So let 's discuss what is actually in the

The Associated Press 182 ACAP 186 South Korea and Japan The Future Is Here 190 South Korea 190 Japan 195 Conclusion 198 The first chapter like most first chapters of books sets out what the problems are This is as far as most reviewers go and they don t even go very far into the first chapter In identifying what the problems are the purpose is not as Nate 's review suggests and too many others believe to attack copyright Instead the why of the Copyright Wars is described as being economic On page 36 I state The economic conflict at the heart of the Copyright Wars lies in what economist Joseph Schumpeter termed creative destruction the introduction of innovative products and business models that displace old ones Far from being a threat to capitalism Schumpeter 's great insight was that creative destruction incessantly revolutionizes the economic structure from within incessantly destroying the old one incessantly creative a new one This process of creative destruction is the essential fact about capitalism It is what capitalism consists in and what every capitalist concern has got to live in Capitalism is Schumpeter described by nature a method of economic change and not only never is but can never be stationary Stabilized capitalism is a contradiction in terms As an inherent fact every company must prepare the way for its own disruption Innovation the root cause of creative destruction is thus the way capitalism survives its own inherent tendency toward monopolization and stagnation even as innovation is regarded as an existential threat to those who benefit from the status quo In Schumpeter 's words a new firm 's intrusion into an existing industry always entails warring with an old sphere which tries to prohibit discredit or otherwise restrict every advantage afforded to the new form by its innovation Given the inevitability of such counter-innovative instincts by existing business in order to ensure the continued vitality of innovation and capitalism itself we must encourage innovation rather than try to kill it off as the copyright industries do I follow this up in chapter 9 with a much more detailed discussion of Schumpeter and the economics of the Copyright Wars On page 102 I place copyright owners within this context stating This is not to suggest that the copyright industries are venal quite the contrary it is to argue that they are all too normal Distorted incentives lead to distorted conduct because our current copyright laws provide rights and remedies that are far beyond what is necessary for copyright owners to recoup their investments and make respectable profits and instead give copyright owners powerful weapons to quash competition and control consumers we should not be surprised that the copyright industries utilize those weapons ( and then some ) In this respect the copyright industries are no different than Wall Street or any other company placed in a similar situation In Nate 's review there is not a single mention of book 's economic analysis even though it is the heart of the book There is not a single mention of the book 's extensive examination of the economic evidence presented by copyright owners and this is indeed ironic given that I quote from Ars Technica 's own leading work on this See pages 31-36 of the book Nor is there any discussion of the book 's emphasis on the different nature of marketing in the content industries and in other consumer-first industries I discuss the work of Harvard Business School professor Theodore Levitt I say on page 23 ( is it too much to read 23 pages ): Although usually written about as battles over technology or principles the Copyright Wars are instead centrally rooted what Harvard Business School professor Theodore Levitt called marketing myopia I then discuss these theories including Levitt 's own take on Hollywood But rather than simply say that some content owners are bad bad bad I try to understand the source of the problem Here is what I say on page 26 The myopia stems from corporate copyright owners adoption of control as their principal business model closed systems in which copyright owners tightly control everything connected to their works which play back devices will be offered to the public what types of access controls will be interposed before consumers can ever see hear or in the case of books or other literary works even read a snippet of the work the time period during which consumers will have access to the work how many times can consumers see hear or read the work in what format will consumers be able to access the work what will they be able to do with the work once they finally access it Can they copy reasonable portions for criticism and comment can they make personal use copies or copies for use on other devices can they use parts of the work to make other new works including mash-ups I then tie this in turn into the mantra that content is king and instead assert that the consumer is king simply because copyright cannot be used to get a single consumer to buy anything It is only consumer demand for products or services that gets copyright owners money I have said over and over again that I want copyright owners to succeed and that we all should want copyright owners to succeed but by satisfying consumer demand not by thwarting it Nate 's review has no discussion of this part of the book at all even though it is a central thesis of the book Instead we have below-the-belt shots like the end of the review The views may not be Google 's but it 's not hard to see why Patry has landed at an aggregator and indexer of content rather than a creator of it Which in a way is too bad making him the top lawyer at the MPAA or RIAA would be fascinating to watch though we re doubtful that those atop the big content industries share his easy confidence that innovation quickly produces greater profits or that less copyright law can be better copyright law Nate is referring to the disclaimer in the book which states the book represents my views not Google 's The above quote from his review is designed to both acknowledge that disclaimer and deny it in the same breath There is nothing in the book that advocates for less copyright law a sentiment I in fact criticize Instead I argue for effective copyright laws (P ages 37-38 ) We all benefit from effective copyright laws and we all suffer from ineffective laws What I dispute is that copyright is a zero sum game but that argument like advocating effective copyright laws doesn t make good press Here is what I actually say For policy makers and the public copyright is not a winner-takes-all proposition Copyright is a system to advance public interests those interests can be furthered by a copyright regime tailored to provide sufficient incentives to create new works (P age 37 ) That 's a far cry from simply shilling for aggregators ( a term I reject anyway ) or calling for less copyright law Nor is there any discussion in the review of chapters 5 and 6 of the book which discuss the implications of the debate about copyright as property and in which I instead take the view that copyright is a set of social relationships The purpose of viewing copyright that way is again not to take sides but rather to call for debating the issues on the merits Hence on page 109 I say The advantage in regarding copyright as a system of social relationships is that it focuses attention where it belongs in mediating conflicts within that system Such an approach does not favor aggregators or content owners but rather asks that we consider the effects of legislation on society as a whole a whole that includes everyone as a 's takeholder to use a current buzzword Does that view stem from being employed by Google does it favor Google Obviously not but one would never know that is my view from the review Finally what about the book 's own use of metaphors Is it indicative that I unwittingly fell prey to the very tactic I supposedly condemn I don t know how to respond to such a ridiculous question It assumes that in writing a book that focuses on language I was unaware of the very language I was using and how it would be perceived by others and that reviewers -- who have neither done their own research nor written their own books somehow managed to burrow into the book and come up with a gotcha in your dreams Here is what I say about this exact point ( having anticipated it in the book itself mind you ): The danger of conceptual metaphors in law is easy to identify Inferences inherent in the source domain (s ay sharks ) are automatically mapped onto the target domain (s ay lawyers ) where they become an inherent part of how we reason about the target domain ( lawyers are sharks ) This process is not one of comparison where we merely note similarities and differences between two preexisting categories ( like chicken and pheasant ) instead the mapping of inferences from the source to the target domain creates meaning in the target domain that did not exist before Such mapping however may not always be apt it may in fact be horribly wrong Lord Palmerston once quipped Half the wrong assumptions at which mankind arrive are reached by the abuse of metaphors and by mistaking general resemblance or imaginary similarity for real identity In

Happy SXSW week to you and yours Once again I will not be attending although I recently wondered if I could have gotten a record label or PR firm to cover my airfare and bar tabs while I whore myself for whatever bands they have in attendance On the other hand I harbor a dislike for much indie music and can see where it may have ended up as a Fear Loathing on 6th Street type of occasion We were somewhere over Louisiana when the drugs began to take hold Anyway as you might guess my inbox was full of notices about appearances at SXSW Probably the majority of the bands in today 's post will be there but I can t be arsed to dig up schedules for you If you like the band and you re going to be in Austin this week I 'm sure you ll figure it out This is a pretty small inbox purge because a lot of the stuff I received was electronica or whiney self-indulgent indie / emo stuff or some mash-up / remix of the two genres and I 'm really not in the mood to hear that The top stuff today is easily The Choke and The Ex-Girlfriend 's Club Both bands bring the garage rock sound that I so enjoy Also if you think back to my last mailbox post you ll recollect Pack A D Well as the fates would have it The Choke are on tour with Pack A D You ll definitely want to check out that bill if they come to a town near you The Koot Hoomi track comes from a Hall and Oates tribute album the group did It 's called The Dark Side of Hall and Oates and is bizarre enough that it warranted inclusion here As always follow the links for more information The Choke Garage / Punk / Soul From New York N Y Band

lightening struck twice when he tapped guitar virtuoso Steve Vai for his first full-length solo album 1986 's Eat em and Smile Following a decade alongside E ie Van Halen anything less would have seemed as if Diamond Dave were just settling for what he could get Instead he dove into his solo career with a big splash introducing to the world one of the few guitarists who could arguably out-Van Halen E ie Van Halen Steve Vai had of course been around for years before DLR brought him on board He d been working with Frank Zappa since 1979 and was often credited on Zappa 's albums as performing 's tunt guitar or impossible guitar parts Vai left as Zappa 's fulltime guitar player in the early 80s releasing a solo album and serving a short time as Yngwie Malmsteen 's replacement in Alcatrazz Then in 1985 he made the career move that would catapult him onto rock 's world stage In an old interview with the DLR Army fansite Vai reminisced about how he ended up joining forces with Diamond Dave Billy Sheehan who would play bass on Eat em and Smile recommended Vai to Dave I ll never forget Vai said I was in the shower covered in soap and a call came in Hey this is Dave Roth man I was like No it 's not He said Yeah man we re putting a group together Eat em and Smile came out to mostly positive reviews Critics agreed the album was fun in the style of the early Van Halen albums and was actually better than the slick pop rock coming from Dave 's old band mates Some even called it the real follow-up to 1984 Shy Boy mp3 In this age of iPods and iTunes and random singles it 's unusual to sit and listen to an entire album This past week though I ve been in the mood to put on an album ( OK a CD whatever ) and listen to the whole thing Call it random song burnout but I ve gotten tired of hearing whatever comes up on 's huffle I want control over my musical destiny One of the disks I listened to this weekend was AC / DC 's U S debut High Voltage I specify the U S debut because that 's the one I have and also because this version was actually a compilation of AC / DC 's first two Australian releases High Voltage and T N T Their Aussie debut release also had a much different track list than what the rest of the world would get The album that hit these shores in May 1976 included only two tracks from the original Australian release with the rest of its songs being pulled from T N T The track I 'm reaching out for today Little Lover is one of the two from the original release that made it onto the international version Typical of many AC / DC songs from this era it 's a sleazy bluesy romp about a groupie (\ When the band said goodnight I had to say hello ) It 's also one of my favorites from this album and one you probably never hear anymore Little Lover mp3 ( Can You Go a Little Deeper is an irregularly recurring feature here wherein I resurrect old favorites lost songs and other things you maybe haven t heard in a while ) When I was back there in seminary school Oh wait that 's a different story How about when I was back there in high school I saw Devo make their network television debut on Saturday Night Live Although many of my tastes were very white bread and mainstream I was also drawn toward music that was outside of that box In the harsh world of high school those tastes were seldom met with approval Such was the case when the Monday after their October 1978 appearance on SNL I went to school raving about this band who had quirkily covered Satisfaction and had the gall to appear dressed in yellow jumpsuits like some freaks from another planet while preaching de-evolution And all this just a week after the Stones themselves had graced the stage at Studio 8H SNL was still relatively new and hip then so everyone watched it and everyone had seen Devo and everyone hated them Those of you who are still just a few years removed from high school will remember how fear of the unknown and different is a potent virus that pervades every school everywhere So of course a couple of weeks later when I showed up at school sporting a Devo t-shirt it was greeted with hatred and derision by the cool kids rocking their Mahogany Rush tees tl dr I 'm posting Devo not Mahogany Rush This is a collection of live Devo recorded at various venues and at various dates from the 1978 SNL appearance through a 1988 performance of Girl U Want Unfortunately other than rough dates I don t have any a itional information on where the songs come from ( I Can t Get No ) Satisfaction mp3 SNL 1978 Mongoloid mp3 1978 Uncontrollable Urge mp3

Girl U Want mp3 1988 That 's Good mp3 1988 Is it too early in the day to star drinking whiskey Cause dammit that 's what Popa Chubby makes me want to do Popa Chubby ( more on the name in a bit ) plays the kind of raunchy blues / rock-a-billy / old-school country that you want to hear in a bar not sitting on the couch in your living room at 10 in the morning Last year he released his 19th album Vicious Country a disk that not only showed off his talent on the guitar but also paid tribute to the legendary music that has influenced him along the way The album while not attracting much mainstream attention continued to build on the legend that is Chubby Ted Horowitz came out of the Bronx raised on Clapton Hendrix and the Stones By the time he was in his early 20 's he had found his love for the blues but had also found his way into occasional work with Richard Hell Ted 's first big break was winning a national blues talent search sponsored by KLON a public radio station in Long Beach Calif I ve found two versions as to how Ted Horowitz became Popa Chubby The first comes from something Chubby himself said He was jamming one night with Bernie Worrell of Parliament-Funkadelic he says and He was singing a song called Popa Chubby and he pointed at me Popa Chubby basically means to get excited The core of my music is about excitement I think music should make people feel alive The other version unsourced I might a but on the Popa Chubby Wiki page claims the name is a variation of the term pop a chubby My guess is that as usual the truth is somewhere between the two versions Popa Chubby 's 20th album The Fight Is On is due out March 22 If you can t find it your local big box retailer ( haha ) you can order it from the Popa Chubby website In the meantime here are a couple of things from the Vicious Country LP The woman on vocals is Galea Chubby 's sometime bass player and longtime collaborator Break Me Down mp3 Satan is Real / Straight to Hell ( Hank III cover ) mp3 Harper Valley P T A ( Jeannie C Riley cover ) mp3 Right now seems as good a time as any to bring you up to speed on erstwhile Guns N Roses guitarist Izzy Stradlin Of course you know Izzy left the Gunners in late 1991 to pursue other interests He released his debut solo album Izzy Stradlin the Ju Ju Hounds within a short time of leaving G n R seemingly disappeared for six years then released a second solo effort in 1998 The next year Izzy released the Japan-only Ride On followed in ( relatively ) quick succession by two more albums both released on independent labels Since then Izzy has stuck to Internet-only releases supported by a small but loyal fan base His latest disk Smoke was released last November with no real media attention but a lot of excitement from Izzy 's fans Comments such as Simply Izzy signature and guaranteed Izzy nothing more nothing less were posted on the ChopAway Website following the album 's release I haven t listened to any new Izzy Stradlin music in probably 10 years Once in a while I ll pull out the Ju Ju Hounds disk which I love and give that a spin And I ve always appreciated Izzy 's serious Ron Wood influence In fact if memory serves they actually did a song together many years ago Smoke picks up where I left off with Izzy 10 years ago He still plays bluesy rock n roll and still flaunts his Stones influence With no industry suits breathing down his neck Izzy is free to make the music he and his fans enjoy Sometimes it 's refreshing to hear something that hasn t changed to suit the times Comfort Zone mp3 To my knowledge Smoke is available only through iTunes although some of his older albums are on Amazon I figure the last day of the month is as good a time as any to dump out the mailbox Start fresh next month and all that A lot of stuff from bands that are going to be at SXSW next month I ll be not attending again this year so who plays or doesn t play isn t going to much affect me Just send me good music if you want me to post it Kthx I 'm gonna jump right in with my pick of the litter The Pack A D from the home of the 2010 Winter Olympics are a duet guitar and drums a la Jack and Meg and take a similar garage / blues approach to their music Singer Becky Black has garnered more than a few comparisons to a certain legendary 60 's whiskey-throated blues shouter I really liked this band and look forward to hearing more of their music A couple of other things that are interesting Patrick Bower 's The Dark Lord ( of Love )\ has a weird dark sound to it and made me want to hear it more than once Moneybrother 's Born Under a Bad Sign is another of those tracks I almost passed on but after a couple of listens decided to include It 's a sort of poppy dancey type of thing Maybe like something from the first Killers album or something Just know that it 's not a cover of the Albert King classic The very last song on today 's list Sleepwalking I decided to include sight unseen That is to say I didn t even care if the music was up to my usual rigorous standards Everything Is Made In China or EIMIC as their friends call them come from Russia When was the last time you heard a Russian pop

were good Despite all qualifications I happened recently to run up on some newer Aerosmith that 's pretty good So I think I ve found the problem They need to cut out the shit in the studio I found a couple of disks of demos and damned if even the crap songs from the later albums sound decent when they re unadorned by studio fluffery Prime example Living on the Edge which was in my opinion a typical late model Aerosmith pop song The demo shows the song stripped down and raw before Bruce Fairburn glossed it up and turned it into mainstream mediocrity This collection which was probably assembled by a fan is titled Divers Aerosmith I don t know if that 's meant to be Diver 's or Diverse Regardless the original set had 32 songs some of which had been released commercially some of which had poor sound quality and some of which just sucked ( i e an orchestral version of Crazy ) I trimmed the fat and ended up with 11 songs that I think are pretty quality With the exception of Mama Kin and Walk This Way everything comes from Permanent Vacation or newer And to the best of my knowledge nothing here has been commercially released Bottom line Here 's yet another Aerosmith post You know we re all still fans Buried Alive mp3 Pump outtake Crazy mp3 acoustic version Guilty Kilt mp3 Hollywood mp3 Permanent Vacation demo Line Up mp3 smoky bar mix Livin on the Edge mp3 Get A Grip

My new blog is active at http // ondrejka net If any of you are still reading apologies for going dark Too much work too much travel Sitting in the United Club at Heathrow with T-Mobile 's WiFi barely working Just finished a book worth reading Fooled by Randomness Jonathan Seelig of Akamai and Globespan fame recommended it Enjoyable topical and provides a delightful framework for thinking about how to measure performance against underlying trends -- particularly when the underlying trends change dramatically This is so evocative of Second Life Nice coverage of its creation story by Hamlet World Builder from Bruce Branit on Vimeo Amazing what serious talent tech and 2000 can do Via Google estimates on total number of US homes current foreclosed or being foreclosed vary between 1M and 2M Let us assume an upper bound of 2M homes Median US home prices are freefall currently around 175 000 down from a peak of over 300 000 in 2006 Of course in foreclosed areas like Cleveland the real value is basically 0 So let 's try to determine the sum total of wealth lost by these toxic assets assuming 50 % of foreclosed home are worth effectively 0 and half are worth the current median (1 M homes ) x ( 300 000 lost ) + (1 M homes ) x ( 300 000 - 175 000 lost ) = 425 billion So 425 billion to keep 2 million families in their homes make it easier for those families to hold on to jobs and to keep working to prop up the all the credit default swaps etc that are collapsing because these mortgages aren t being repaid and to ensure that banks don t collapse due to unpaid loans Why are we pouring the money into the banks directly rather than protecting tax payers Oh because doing this would reward a bunch of predatory lenders First which is more important keeping people in homes as we enter a second great depression or punish those who took advantage of lax regulations to cause it Second and more importantly the act of repaying these loans would enable a process of identifying the top 20 % of most egregious loans allowing those who broke the law to be prosecuted OK I 'm not an expert but given the astronomical sums we re talking about keeping a sizable percentage of the workforce in homes plus propping up the umpteen trillions of dollars leveraged against those mortgages 425 billion is starting to look pretty reasonable While not quite the technology convergence of a Roomba getting run over by a Segway being able to read Kindle books on iPhone is pretty darn close Amazon just released a new app for iPhone that let 's you do just this and it is very slick You connect it to your Kindle account and all your Amazon book purchases are available with the last page you re on more-or-less properly synced up Very cool The reading experience is very good for such a small device the interface is slick and downloads quick on even a 1G iPhone Downsides Really the only big problem is that there doesn t appear to be a way to send mobipocket pdf or other text files to iPhone the way you can for Kindle This is a real bummer as currently 23 out of the 135 books on Kindle are Amazon e-books The rest are mostly from the Baen library I hope they decide to fix this as it makes both devices more valuable to me Still combined with Amazon 's new digital publishing platform Amazon is working hard to create a strong ecosystem around e-books Great opportunity for authors who can move early I suspect I ve posted a fair amount -- and quite positively -- about my current Kindle so it should come as no surprise that I was quick to order Kindle 2 It arrived Wednesday and I

translates to a much more solid feel out of the box although I ve found it to be slightly less comfortable to hold perhaps due to Kindle 1 muscle memory To first order it operates the same as Kindle 1 The boot time is much faster the inward clicking buttons superior and less prone to accidental clicks and the page flips enough quicker to be noticeable The new screen 's 16-gray levels make photos look surprisingly good and being able to charge via USB helps me on the road Finally while I miss the sparkle the multi-way stick does make highlighting a lot easier Downsides Moving content over from my first Kindle was a pain mostly because Whispernet and / or Amazon were clearly slammed Wednesday night The leather binder doesn t have the original 's elastic to hold it closed All-in-all a great set of incremental improvements and an even better device for my needs As for Daemon I really enjoyed it It has all of the trappings of a first book -- uneven pacing limited character development some typos -- but wow I ve never seen a book that mixes action this level of understanding of the god complex all game developers have the technology around robotics virtual worlds and the net and wraps it all up in book that is speculative while only leveraging real tech Very cool and quite recommended I ve previously written about the password anti-pattern so it is distressing to see it becoming the standard in virtual worlds as well James just posted about what would otherwise be a w00t-worthy event from the bright folks at realXtend direct teleportation between Second Life-compatible virtual wrolds Very cool stuff except for When you click the link the viewer brings up a log-in window enter in the avatar name and password associated with the other world you re going to and the teleport process begins emphasis mine Sigh What makes this all the more distressing is that two years ago Mark Lentczner Ian Wilkes and I designed the solution to this on a whiteboard We had recognized that between OpenSim and whatever came next that there would be a critical need to enable interoperation through communication / shared presence It also provided a nice model for scalability not to mention allowing for deeper interconnections between Second Life and the rest of the web It has influenced internal design discussions as well as the standards efforts but hasn t moved fast enough to be available to projects like realXtend which is too bad I am a huge fan of Juan Enriquez who I was fortunate enough to meet him while giving a Second Life talk to AMD a few years ago His book Untied States of America is one of the most thought provoking books I ve read and a huge influence on my Collapsing Geography article Thus it should come as no surprise that his TED talk is brilliant It is really two talks in one The first is a fairly succinct analysis of the current econopocolypse The second a believable gentle transition from humanity as we see ourselves today to our inevitable bio-engineered cyborg future Inevitable because the techniques and technologies that create therapies to grant the disabled human-normal abilities won t stop at human-normal Like all other technology processes the overlapping s-curves of therapeutics are accelerating forward As they claw forward along the flat early part of the curve progress is painfully slow but wait a while Like all exponentials beware of forward predictions The long term will be far more transformational than we expect 
We tested it properly and it required about 20 ml of alcohol to bring 0 5 litres of water to the boil ( boiled for 60 seconds ) in about 8 mins I think it is actually a bit faster than the side vent but you do have to carry the extra 30 grams of pot stand The extra advantage of this is that the stove fits in the pot stand and is protected when travelling I expect this one to last a lot longer that the purely aluminium ones We have got more and more light and with this returning light we have had more and more blows We sort of define a blow when the wind reached about 20 knots ( we measure this about 10m above the surface ) at this point working outside becomes nearly impossible You can easily walk between buildings but actually working outside is not nice At 30 knots you start to lose sight of the other buildings and for someone on crutches its not great Above 40 knots its best not to linger too long outside One thing that has happened is that this year 's weather haven nearly blew away The wind was above 40 knots and somehow it worked open a bit of the tent The weather haven is a very very large tent that is used to store the blimp The blimp is filled with helium and the Simpson people use it to measure low level ozone by attaching special instruments to the bottom Anyway the wind was so high the weather haven nearly blew away The blimp inside was damaged so much that after we had fixed everything we were able to crawl into it through the gapping holes in the side

by FERENC IVANICS We usually walk on roads with high traffic We ve seen a lot of things but we think there are two hot-shots of the roadside bottles filled with piss tossed by truck drivers used diapers tossed by parents We ve gotten used to their sight I try to understand the habit but I can t really I know it 's smelly but there 's at least two garbage cans in ten minutes drive This one on the photo puzzled us why a six-pack Were there six babies All had crapped at the same time Was this a long-time collection Still a mystery In case you haven t noticed news on this blog are not exactly real-time There are two separate reasons The boys don t have internet-enabled mobile devices ( or service providers ) they cannot post directly but with a delay ( from internet cafes ) which is sometimes a few days and in troubled periods can grow up to two weeks Even though the language skills of Ferenc and István have improved a lot they post in Hungarian One of us from the background team translates and edits all the posts This a 's another delay to the process an a itional two or three weeks To get up-to-date news subscribe to the twitter feed by FERENC IVANICS Su enly a red car stopped by our side with a mi le-aged couple inside Soon we made clear that we weren t hitchhikers and didn t need a ride Next day we found the place a German-Mexican guy had recommended us two months ago He told us that the shore of the lagoon is clean ant the owner surely would let us stay for the night So we had fought our way through the jungle found the spot a small bungalow and a red car at the lake shore Yep the red car of that kind couple The Bacalar Lagoon is and extremely pleasant place and its water is even cleaner We took a refreshing swim in the blue freshwater lake and moved on the next day by FERENC IVANICS On the eastern shore of the peninsula there 's rocky coast as well If you look closer many of these rocks are dead corals Sian Ka an features the third longest coral reef of the world Unfortunately we don t have the means to scuba-dive watching the colorful fishies underwater On the other side of the peninsula there is a series of mixed-water lagoons The water is crystal clear so it 's another preferred destination for scuba-divers We managed to walk to Punta Allen in two days Bu there came the twist How to get across to Playón which is nothing but a wooden stage a small harbor for boats To our surprise we found a volunteer almost immediately After crossing the bay ( one or two miles ) he mentioned that he wouldn t reject a small payment But we couldn t give him anything we were broke Literally But he did take it well From this point forward it was 40 miles of forest totally uninhabited forest Practically it was a 40 miles long tunnel We lived on biscuits milk powder and canned beans We did have enough food for three days but definitely not enough water On these parts of the reserve there 's no coconut palms so we could have gotten into trouble There was almost no traffic on this road On the second day we ran out of water but then the skies opened up and small ponds began to form on the mi le of the path Thanks to our friend Drew we had a water filter with us so we were saved Trees trees trees The longest walk we ve had under trees And these trees gave us some headache when we were looking for a camping spot But since there was no traffic we camped on the road Not on the mi le of it but on the road And on the third day we reached Felipe Carrillo Puerto It was a great relief Was it worth it Sure Sian Ka an Part 1 by FERENC IVANICS From Tulum to Chetumal there 's a paved road But there 's another path that takes you through the biosphere reserve Sian Ka an That is the major national park in the Caribbean and it 's been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1987 Mostly made of huge palm forests there 's a peninsula with freshwater lagoons a coral reef etc We knew many tourists visit this area from Tulum And then come back to Tulum We wanted to move on south after visiting Sian Ka an We didn t know if it was possible so this choice was a bit risky but we wanted to see what does the real wild Caribbean looks like without the signs of human civilization huge hotels crowded beaches harbors And Sian Ka an is beautiful There 's a 35 miles long road from Tulum to Punta Allén running on the peninsula between palm trees and mangroves the sea is extreme blue but there 's too much litter running on shore Our only trouble ( besides the ever-present mosquitoes ) was drinking water It wasn t serious though I mean we could have stopped a tourist convoy to ask for water anytime but we turned to our most-honored coconuts Wildlife is dense in Sian Ka an we ve seen coatis western red pandas capybaras small crabs living in shells and there 's pumas and jaguars as well in this jungle But the most dangerous species we ve met was that little crab with its heavy claws Sian Ka an Part 2 by FERENC IVANICS Tulum is an authentic Caribbean holiday resort It 's expensive for us but if you look at its beauties and compare the prices to other places I d say it 's rather affordable or even economical There are a lot of young travelers hippies nature lovers here they rent cheap bungalows or camp near the beach We by luck ran into Chain and Jaime they run a campsite near the Tulum beach We can tell that was the most exotic camping we d ever seen We passed two quite enjoyable days there ( though you can t escape from the mosquitoes ) This lovely couple told us we could stay for as long as we wanted but we had things to get arranged in the town of Tulum Thank you by FERENC IVANICS Thanks to the helpful tourists in Playa del Carmen we bought a new pair of tents Our fourth pair on our 8000 miles walk We bought two Jeep Hiker Tents these are pretty strange tents but they seem strong enough ant that 's what 's important for us They chipped in enough to buy some new socks and pants as well Due to the almost expired visas our days were counted in Mexico We were expecting to receive new shoes from the U S so we arrived in Tulum full of hope Thank you for your support by FERENC IVANICS We stopped at Playa del Carmen some 40 miles south of Cancún Found a deserted go-kart track and made a base camp there Our tents are full of holes our clothes aren t any better Playa del Carmen is full of tourists Canadians Europeans from the U S A The city is full of bars shops restaurants it 's a pleasure factory We just sit on the 5th avenue with a WorldWalk-board Two bearded guys in identical clothes looks interesting Many passer-byes are curious about us and we always chat with them usually mentioning the situation with our tents and clothes We get some small donations and even some major help like the support from the Hungarian Tukarcsy family (W e met other Hungarians as well many thanks Marcsi Szilvi Balázs and Tamás ) It was a special experience spending New Years Eve at the beach taking a swim The water was clean and calm I guess I don t have to say anything about the blue seawater We enjoyed it a lot and it was nice to see how grown-ups unveil their inner child by FERENC IVANICS We reached the Caribbean at Cancún I guess most of you have seen pictures of the blue Caribbean Sea I always thought those were images altered in Photoshop a computer generated exaggeration We ve seen the Mediterranean of the French and the Spanish The Atlantic in Africa and in Miami the Gulf of Mexico in the U S and in Mexico Their beaches were playing in another league This is something totally different The color of the water is amazing So it 's not surprising that Cancún is the capital of tourism is Mexico An 18 miles long beach sprinkled with luxurious hotels that suit your every need Well we think it 's interesting but very distant from us 
Well I said I would be posting something when inspiration struck me - didn t think it would take this long I have finally written something so thought I d post it A small boy on a beach ran to me last week and gave me a winkle A winkle such a strange and sad little object I shook and then brushed the sand from it Poor creature I thought I took the shell and listened but I could not hear the sound of the sea blowing from within Instead I fancied I heard crying Yes there was a dry sob sob sob coming deep from within So strange I immediately wished to smash the shell to dash it on the deck like a greedy gull but fought the urge One thought was playing in my head like a record jumping and stuck on the same syllables like a drifting soul song trapped in purgatory Plant me Plant me it spoke Plant me So I did I scrabbled in the dirt tossing the clods and broken earthworms aside In my bluster I d chopped these worms in half or worse No matter I thought - they ll grow anew Regeneration you see - I 'm creating new life and new worth Dropping the shell into the moist hollow I carefully recovered the jumble of soil and cloven earthworms imprisoning the gentle winkle And then I waited I waited for it to grow And the rains came and the sun shone down and the winds blew the blossom from the boughs All seemed but in requiem to the sad little shell The thought dawned upon me smiling grimly spreading icily across my body like electrical current I had not planted but had rather buried the poor creature Now beneath the dying pink flowers it was lost to me I must be mad I thought Really I must now be insane Hi Just thought I d say you can catch up with me on Twitter I ll be posting random bits of writing here http // twitter com / paulbernard Cheers Paul Hi guys Well I returned from my week away from blogging refreshed and considering my next move It 's been six months since I started The Daily Tale and I thought it might be a good idea to freshen the format up try something a little different So I have created a new blog called The Daily Postcard where I will do my daily blogging from now on The Daily Tale was an unexpected success and I d like to thank everyone for taking the time to support me by reading the stories and leaving such great comments However I think the format had gone as far as it could and I was chomping at the bit to try something a little different I 'm quite into photography and wanted to devote some time to that along with writing So that 's kind of what the concept of The Daily Postcard is - a photo and a short tale to accompany the image I hope it will become something the browser can either just dip in and out of when they feel like or alternatively let their imagination become swept up in the twin assault of the image and the words My reasoning for starting it on another blog site was so that I could leave The Daily Tale blog here as an archive for anyone who wanted to flick back and read their favourite stories again When I ve finished my Postcard project I will seek to do the same with that too So that 's all I think I hope you ll join me in The Daily Postcard See you on the other side Please follow the link to The Daily Postcard http // thedailypostcard blogspot com / Hello all I am taking a short hiatus from my Daily Tale-ing I will be on holiday for a week and then when I return there will be a revamp in order for my daily blog I hope you ll be back in a week to experience it Paul Cos I heard it in the wind and I saw it in the sky And I thought it was the end I thought it was the fourth of July Chris Cornell I saw a firework dead burnt on the street I reflected on how sad its resting place how briefly it had burned and now how ignominious its fall At one time it had potential Potential to explode and cause delight Always while it had potential it was a special thing A device of magic waiting to bring wonder In its short life of usefulness it was above us all It could fly it could shower us with metallic petals of light Great golden arcs that would shard in the sky And then dropping black and crippled onto an unlit street corner it could now only move if kicked or gusted by a force of nature Still at least it had fulfilled its potential She looked at the image long and hard She scratched her head to show him that she was thinking about thinking long and hard She moved her head around to jaunty angles ways that she almost never moved her neck No matter what she did or how she considered the possible illumination of the piece of artwork he displayed proudly before her she couldn t ascertain any relevant meaning from it It really was just a mess of paint to her She contemplated telling him this Maybe he d appreciate what it said to her but she bit her tongue She bit her fingernail as well and then stopped in case he was looking at her He wasn t looking He was sat on an old red sofa spotted with paint and ripped open in places so that the stuffing poured out like fat The sofa was turned away from the easel away from where he worked so that he could at least try to switch off from his mind 's displays for a while The radio was on at that low volume that is as annoying as too loud He was thinking this artist about something someone had said to him earlier He stared at the music coming from the radio He found that he often realised that something interesting something insightful about another person had been revealed to him in conversation and he would only pick up on it later By this time the conversation had long faded to dust and there was little chance to query the interesting party Another wasted opportunity Celine he called without taking his eyes from the stereo What do you think She stopped looking at the splurge on the canvas before her and bit her nail again Well I loved the funny picture of the radioactive clown she said Very surreal He smiled and no ed He was pleased enough but he found himself fighting not to ask her about the latest piece the work he was proudest of I 'm glad you liked it he said Honestly I am She moved uncomfortably in her jeans They were just a little too tight and she felt it now as she walked back to the couch The room was lit by just the spotlights pointing on the two easels and as she stepped away from these she felt more confident She picked up her long drink and nibbled the edge of the glass There was room to sit next to the artist on the couch but Celine opted for a leather armchair facing him She sat down slowly with her knees together and sipped her drink The spotlights flared in her ice-cubes as she tipped the glass back It 's a shame said the man that you didn t like The Vision He referred here to the title of the strange abstract painting and not in some grandiose way to his overall method or philosophy of painting The girl gulped her drink hard and swallowed an ice cube It stuck in her chest and made her entire body tense up She gritted her teeth against the cold It 's not that I didn t like it she said It 's that I didn t understand it She fumbled now as the ice moved on away from her chest I 'm sorry sorry about that Robert I just didn t quite get it maybe It 's a shame for us both that you preferred the clown he said His words barely hung there for a second before her reply Why Robert Robert shook his head then dropped it to the side a little and raised his eyes to look at her His eyes looked softly and sadly upon her Maybe you don t know why yet But you will later he said They didn t say anything for a minute or so Just looked A buzzer sounded at the door A man spoke It 's Davi d Celine said Shall I tell him to come up No it 's fine I have to finish up here I 'm tired Goodnight Celine Celine stood awkwardly and put down her glass She looked down at Robert for a moment and then turned and stepped carefully across the wooden floor to the door unbolted its latch and pulled hard The great old metal door swung on creaking hinges Goodnight Robert I really did like your pictures you know Robert no ed Don t forget to lock the door behind me she said stepping out of one world and into another A man standing on a beach casts his pet octopus into the sea He holds it by three of its legs and swings it in dizzying circles before letting go to send it flinging back into the sea where it was spawned As it plops into the water a red ball he hopes it 's the last he ll see of that octopus Sinking into its new home the octopus lingers in the swell growing accustomed to the new tastes and sights but soon it spreads its legs and swims off into the deeper waters in search of dark rocks and things to eat The man sits down on the sand He has had that octopus for three years It was a treasured gift of a former lover now gone The waves break ever so gently on this shore So gently in fact that the short breakers have created a tiny shelf at the point where the sand remains dry and full Upon this shelf climbs a green crab It has come from the sea allowing itself to be deposited there by the tide It sidles towards the man unnoticed then nips at his sandals and toes Woah the man lets out expressions of concern He looks for some flotsam to flick this crab away or something heavy with which to crush its shell But before he can find this he hears a voice Brian what have you done He stares down at the green crab You have cast away your only friend The crab speaks And it a resses him by name Strange creature says Brian How came you to speak so and know my given name The green crab replied that he was one of the great seers of the sea and with the lobster the ray and the narwhal views all that occurs both above and below the waves The cockles sang to me from the rocks over there continued the green crab And then the sprats and starfish whispered to each other that the octopus had returned to us before his time The green crab explained that the octopus was a great talisman a conduit between the realms of sea and land Such creatures were placed in homes throughout all the continents of the world allowing the seers to get a clear view of the airy world above them helping them make decisions and policies for life under the sea Even your partner Selkie was put into your life by us Once she thought a bond had been established between you and the octopus she knew she had to return to the ocean Now you must go and retrieve your octopus Brian You must try Only you can find it And with these words the green crab motioned with its right claw beckoning Brian towards the sea Brian stood up proudly and with purpose now He had to do this he knew though it seemed impossible He would swim and swim and search and search until he found his red octopus once more He stepped into the light foam of the surf and pushed on until he was waist deep Then he turned back towards the crab and waved The green grab seemed to be waving too Brian lifted his legs from the sandy sea bed and started to swim and swim It was difficult to move his arms though and his legs cut sluggishly through the water He looked to his arm as he tried to take it from the water Fifteen small octopuses of various colours were clinging to it dragging on it As he stopped swimming he felt the myriad suckers of a thousand tentacles attaching themselves to his body Hundreds of octopuses grappled with him and he began to feel sharp stinging sensations across his body A larger tentacle then wrapped about his head and Brian slowly disappeared beneath the blue waters The green crab safe on the shore stopped waving and skittered off across the wet sand feeling satisfied and looking out for a warm rock pool to hunt in The three lads bounding through the weeds at the trackside stopped for breath Johnny the youngest legs wobbling with the effort wanted to sit down but he fought that feeling with all his might He was out with his dad now His brother Michael stood up as straight as he could sucked in a lungful of air and puffed out his chest proudly His father patted his head rather heavily Dad had come to see them today and their mother had rolled her eyes It was their uncle 's birthday their dad had said and so he had thought of something for them all to do A family outing he called it They d crawled under wire fences scrambled down dirty banks and jumped from heights that Johnny had previously thought impossible to survive These were all things his mother and his teachers had told him never to do but here he found himself on an overgrown railway embankment with his father watching the trains go by Not far to go now guys said Peter He was revelling in his new found role of leader a figure to be feared and obeyed Just round the next ben d he said that 's where it happened They hacked onward with their feet until they came to a brown stone wall Peter led them slowly down the bank and onto the gravel at the side of the railway track A curving tunnel opened cavernously before them Right he said When I say the word we re going to run for it There shouldn t be another train for 10 minutes anyway but we re better safe than sorry Michael looked a little incredulous at this but Johnny pushed in front of him eager to race away into the darkness at his father 's command Now come on son Michael 's first up and then you follow him on I ll be close behind you okay Johnny no ed Michael said nothing and just stared ahead into the gloom and then at his shoes Alright go said Peter but Michael didn t move Come on Mike head up and run for it Michael 's body moved almost imperceptibly but again he held himself back For God 's sake Mikey fucking go for it you prick His father raised his voice and his hand and Michael was away He ran blindly into the darkness stumbling upon the rail and then vanishing His father screamed after him to bear left and not to trip on the tracks his voice echoing about him in madness Peter held Johnny by the shoulders as the child strained to follow his brother As soon as his son stopped struggling Peter plunged ahead of him onward into the tunnel He found it curved round gently and then light flooded back into its far mouth Out into the daylight not far up the track Michael sat on the rail crying Peter ran on out of the tunnel towards his eldest son but his mind was gripped by responsibilities and he turned around to see what he d forgotten Johnny came then whimpering out of the darkness rubbing his red eyes and peering at his father with that look of fear and disappointment that can tear at a man 's chest Peter strode towards him picked the boy up with one arm and then stumbled across the thickly piled gravel at the railside until they reached Michael He resisted the urge to grab the lad roughly with his spare arm instead holding out a hand to him Come on he urged a ing I 'm sorry Michael looked up graciously and took the hand Soon they were all sitting on the grass bank looking back at the railway This is it said their father This is the spot where your uncle Mikey died They all stared at a spot on the track and imagined it happening there Noticing there were two different sets of tracks before him Johnny spoke up with a sniff Dad which side was it that uncle Mikey got hit by

I was wondering what you re doing later See I got these Carrot Top tickets my dickhead boss isn t using and was wondering if you re not busy torturing the damned tonight if you wanna catch the show with me maybe catch a brew or two play some Big Buck Hunter Oh Yeah I ll hold Pug Life I watched a ton of figure skating this past Olympics It 's awesome It 's the Fre y Mercury of the Sporting world but with more falling and less good music ( Actually no good music ) I watch it because I like theatricality in my winter sports I also like sparkly things and public humiliation so it really works for me But one thing has me coming back every time The falls The falls are so fucking amazing Some kid from Farawayistan practices tornado jumps and triple lutzes 14 hours a day at gunpoint hoping for the big day when all their work will pay off only to have life sucker punch them in the grundle precisely at the moment of their promised glory I feel so bad for them when it happens but I can t avert my eyes Talk about having your dreams taken away And how much must it suck to have Bob Costas narrating your life 's single most embarrassing moment As if you already didn t feel bad enough now you have a Pa ington Bear inspired man child mocking you with a voice beautiful yet full of judgement and disdain You can almost see God 's hand reaching down from Heaven balling up into a giant fist then obliterating these poor souls until all that is left of them is sadness Glittery piles of pulverized sadness That being said I can t help but wonder who feels worse An ice skater who falls flat on their face in front of millions and millions of disappointed friends family and countrymen or B Kurt Kobain while watching this video B By a landslide I hope Zombie Kurt Kobain rises from the dead just to eat this man 's brains ( via Craplinks ) Fun fact The well tanned circus bears that raised Dolph Lundgren taught him to sing dance and ride a unicycle in the hopes that he could put some threat back in the term triple threat But Dolph learned a lot of from the human world as well like how to wear a tuxedo and not be afraid of fire Thus our hero can make a well dressed torch wielding

as the great man himself once said In Soviet Russia you don t laugh at the state of the country and in America no state in the country laughs at you But seriously what is up America We used to lead the world in prodcution of ridiculous variety shows Giants of the small screen like Laugh-in the Gong Show and Hee Haw testified to our greatness Somehow somewhere between the Jerry Springer and the Backstreet Boys America lost her way We ve got to get back to simpler times We ve got to strap on a smile activate the jazz hands and show um what we ve got Come on people how 's about a little less Julius Caesar and a little more Cesar Romaro Someone 's Twitter account just sent me a Viagra ad ( Actually it was a Viagra knock off Viagra doesn t need to advertise But that 's not the point ) The point is this A human I actually know in flesh form had their microblogging alter-ego possessed by an invisible ( yet clearly capitalist ) computer-robot designed with the sole intention of selling me synthetic sex enhancers in pill form while disguised as a person I ve known for years leaving me feeling violated and manipulated Future 1 Me 0 I 'm old fashioned I guess But I swear that this event is important somehow My gut tells me it 's another sign that robots are taking over the world And my gut 's gut tells him he 's probably right This shit happens all the time to people like us ( internet / tech users ) but not to those Outlanders who for some reason stay off the grid ( non-nerds seniors mountain folk ) It 's weird and unsettling if you step back and think about it It feels

A while back I made my way to Village Haus for a hamburger I recalled my sweeper days when I would enjoy a quick burger at the break room downstairs below the restaurant There is a service window for cast members at the far western end of the main counter ( it is behind the wall just inside the service door there ) A diet Coke Village Haus burger and fries provided me with sustenance on many days It was hardly haute cuisine but it was good enough Better yet it was cool to wind my way through the corridor in the back area and down the stairs There in the bowels of the building was another hallway that led to the break room on the left and restrooms on the right Breaks in that windowless room were fluorescent -filled and usually quiet The room was a pretty good size with tables and chairs and the obligatory TV set on the wall ( usually out of service ) Of course sometimes we would arrange our breaks so that a few of us would head down there together The company was nice We always had a good time No there are not tunnels under Disneyland everywhere ( like at Disney World ) However there are a few underground spots---beneath Tomorrowland Terrace and the old America Sings building in Tomorrowland below New Orleans Square at the old Pit and under Fantasyland and the Village Haus to name a few Lucky me I have seen them all This is Mike signing off Enjoy your weekend Jungleteers ---Mike Today is Post Some More Old Photos Day here at Jungle is 101 Sadly it is not a national holiday It is however recognized as a half-day-without-pay in the Republic of Malta So we ve got THAT going for us which is nice Moving right along and to our immediate left please note a vintage photograph of the Pirates queue before the Bridge was erected Must ve been pretty early as guests could practically walk onto the attraction Based on costuming and guest clothing I 'm putting this one in the 1980s Next the only known photograph of a failed rescue mission to save the Lost Safari in 1987 A host of Adventure / Frontier Attractions cast members somehow managed to find their way to this remote beach Sadly not one of them seemed to notice the missing expedition as the cast members attention was distracted by my passing boat and camera crew Since the Lost Safari had long provided me with some of my best material I was careful not to point them out How those folks from Thunder and the Sailing Ship Columbia made their way to this corner of the teeming jungle remains a mystery Finally a few of my sweeper peeps from back in the day yo Looks like another tough day at Custodial Control To the left of the photo the poster board bears undeniable proof of the fact that we actually received training on how to sweep up trash and use a gum scraper as part of our function and responsibilities On the shelf at the right of the photograph are various tools of the trade boxes of Kimbies (p aper towels sweepers carried like ammo ) cleaning solutions spray bottles of muriatic acid and a box of lye This had to be taken close to the end of the shift otherwise I have no explanation for why these poor people look so flogging happy Their demeanor could possibly be explained as some sort of after-effect of the off-gassing of volatile organic compounds from the cleaning solutions in Custodial 's main offices We can never know for sure I think I have to thank Robin Mora or Jerry Lofquist for originally posting this---not sure where I found it but I 'm glad I did ---Mike It is late on a June night in 1984 and I am working in Fantasyland as a sweeper By late I mean it is the early morning and Disneyland has ended its normal operating day The last few stragglers have been walked out to Main Street by Security and I am alone in the bullpen for Mr Toad 's Wild Ride This was back when the statue of Toad just inside the front window of the queue still had its left arm and hand raised with the fingers pinching his monocle The monocle never survived being constantly swiped by guests So for a period of time we would routinely find Mr Toad holding in his pinched fingers a cigarette---usually with the ends twisted so as to look like an illicit substance often smoked by Cheech and Chong These unique cigarettes were placed there by some creative guests while waiting in line Later as we see in the picture to the left Toad 's left arm appeared to have been taken off and put back on upside down so that it bent BEHIND Toad 's back ( in a pose reminiscent of someone hiding a bouquet of flowers before giving it to a loved one ) The statue in question used to look just like the 's tone 's tatue of Toad that graces the attraction 's entrance facade Take a look See the left arm and the monocle Remove monocle and you have a magnificent spot for a cigarette As always I digress What was my point Ah yes flowerbeds The closing shift for a sweeper involved spending the last hour or so picking trash out of the many flower beds in your assigned area Fantasyland---especially the area in the heart of the realm---left me with the most pleasant memories of this otherwise mundane task Black bulky Disney-issued flashlight in hand as I swept through the area during closing I would shine the beam across the flower beds illuminating cigarette butts popcorn containers remnants of Mickey balloons gum straw wrappers cups ticket stubs Souvenir Guides popcorn pieces drink lids cellophane and other detritus that would find its way from the hands of guests into the beds I would pick up these pieces or sweep them into my pan one bed at a time until I d make a complete circuit I would usually start this process by Dumbo 's calliope and work my way around the flower beds past Village Haus Pinocchio Snow White Tinker Bell 's Toy Shop the Castle courtyard and back up the other side---Peter Pan Mr Toad the Mad Hatter and over to Alice and back along the Storybookland canal near Monstro Each of us sweepers would be going through this process in our respective areas Our lead would meander through the area checking on us and occasionally helping out The area music remained turned on during the whole process and of course the area lights What made it special was the fact that we became the only humans in the realm once the guests had been walked out by security To be one of four or five people in all of Fantasyland---from Castle to Small World---was a pretty cool thing Dumbo 's calliope would bounce out its happy carousel tunes in the background and I would find myself picking to the music on occasion We sweepers developed a posture for attacking the flower beds A foot would be slid under the painted wrought iron fence that surrounded the bed and the sweeper would lean forward over that leg to get at stuff closest to the fence line If you walked through the area during a closing shift you would see a virtual ballet of sweepers rear ends in the air and heads down as they bent over their flower beds with flashlights Between flower beds I would sometimes just stop for a moment and take it all in The lights the music the flowers the familiar attractions the cobblestones Once again me and the Park Maybe I 'm selfish---who isn t at times ---but there are moments when the Park feels like it is there just for me I wish each Disneyland-o-phile could have that unique opportunity to be alone in an area of the Park even for just a few minutes At the end of the shift our area crew of sweepers would gather into a group and make our way back to the Custodial locker We would then go to the locker room and Wardrobe to turn in our costume change and head home We were a closely-knit group Indeed this blog is a testament to the lasting impact that those precious few days as a Cast Member had on me It is either that or some strange sort of mental illness that keeps me at the keyboard posting this stuff As my dear friend Mr Gump would oft impart That 's all I have to say about that ---Mike It is a tradition lost to the ravages of time launching a Skipper into the river on his last day on Jungle Our thanks to Ed Cunningham fearless skipper of the early 80s---and ( thankfully ) someone who bothered to document the antics ( and keep the photos ) Ed originally posted these pics of what was no doubt his last day on Jungle ( even then Management was not keen on Cast Members swimming in attractions during Park hours ) The initial push into the river by a fellow cast member was clearly quite effective as the victim made it all the way across to the catwalk Alas this grand tradition is no longer in favor at modern Disneyland ( ahem The Disneyland Resort ) This is probably for the best We ve heard tell that Ed suffered from the dreaded Jungle River Slimepox on and off for over 27 years after hitting the river Yeeewwww By the way I do not think I will ever tire of seeing photos of the Jungle boats with their striped canopies or the Skipper costumes with the leopard print hat bands These photographs also help to answer the time honored guest question :\ How deep is the water In the mi le photograph our victim has resurfaced and is standing on the mucky bottom with his head and shoulders out of the water It 's that deep For now my friends stay well keep dry and remember as Trader Sam used to tell me often :\ There 's no known cure for Slimepox So when next you cruise the Jungle STAY IN THE BOAT ---Mike All right I ve been bad Very bad I have been dealing with a lot in my other life and have neglected my blog What 's strange though is that I ve actually picked up more followers during this frozen screen phase Perhaps the best way to increase readership of Jungle is 101 is for me to stop writing No such luck folks Today I muse about my first shift as a spry young custodial host in brilliant sweeper whites in May 1984 As the title of this post indicates I was assigned Matterhorn Way in Fantasyland for my first shift on my own after training It is an area of the park ( like I need to tell any of you Parkophiles ) that runs from the northeast corner of the Hub on Main Street ( to the right of Sleeping Beauty 's Castle if you are facing the Castle from Main Street ) and northeast toward the Small World ( on one side ) and more easterly toward the queue for Finding Nemo ( on the other side---Matterhorn Way splits at the base of the Matterhorn---the Alice side and then the Tomorrowland side ) See the photograph from 1985 ( note the 30th Anniversary logo on the light pole ) It is a section of the parade route for most every Disneyland parade The main section of Matterhorn way runs between the Matterhorn and the Fantasyland restrooms just south of Alice in Wonderland It is an open area that is usually not too crowded It is shaded along its western edge by the trees and the castle wall facade that run along the southeastern edge of Fantasyland It 's a great place to be a sweeper Plenty of foot traffic Lots of guest interaction The bathroom is easily located and most guests can be directed there without a map or a 20 minute geography lesson The bullpen for the Matterhorn runs in a single line along the base of the mountain---easy to sweep Just jump in line with your pan and broom ease along with the guests sweep as you go and jump back out when you get across from Alice There are sunny areas but also blessed shade July and August are rough if your area is a place largely devoid of shade like Tomorrowland or along the Rivers of America ( between the River Belle Terrace and Tom Sawyer 's Rafts landing ) Matterhorn Way is a travelers zone---people who are going through it are moving to and fro on their way to other places They usually know where they re going too because once one rounds the corner from Main Street the Small World unmistakingly beckons in the distance with Alice very obviously to the left and a great big white mountain to the right The echoing roar of Harold sounds from inside the mountain and rolls along Matterhorn Way rhythmically Sure you ll get the occasional Can you tell me how to get to the Matterhorn But there is something deeply satisfying about being able to put on your best Disney smile for the guest slowly turning toward the megalith behind you and answering with a two-fingered point Why you re almost there It 's that white mountain to my left Most smile embarrassedly and nod a thank you as they step into the line As that young sweeper on his first shift Matterhorn way was perfect First of all for your lead it was an easy spot to keep track of a newbie There 's nowhere to hide ( or get lost ) It is also an easy area to point out (\ I want you to start at the popcorn cart---hit that area often by the way---over in front of the Matterhorn and then sweep the area all the way past Alice down to the Hub and then the back side of the mountain and back along the Alice side to the popcorn cart again you got that Don t forget to hit the line every half hour or so and don t forget the restrooms ) It 's a spot between worlds within the Park It 's a little Main Street it 's a little Tomorrowland it 's a little Fantasyland---all within an area that takes about 15 minutes to cycle through with a pan and broom Guests enjoyed ( and still do enjoy ) sitting along the concrete benches south of the restrooms They are themed to be part of the Sleeping Beauty Castle and are smooth and usually shaded I often met the most pleasant people seated along there They were happy to have a conversation with a sweeper Many were seniors---resting their legs while the rest of the family scurried elsewhere in the Park How are you today Just fine I d answer Where are you from Oh we re from X ---we re visiting the grandchildren What a lovely day Not too warm for you is it No I keep moving and there 's shade Besides those restrooms over there are cool and air conditioned---and they need sweeping I hadn t even noticed I 'm glad you pointed them out Thank you Et cetera I couldn t believe I was actually getting PAID to stand in Disneyland and talk with people Or to walk through my assigned area with my pan and broom and keep the place Disney clean ( I was pretty gung-ho I ll admit you know even later on the Jungle Cruise I was quick to pick up trash in the queue or in the boats ) For your next visit your assignment is to take a seat along the concrete Castle benches on Matterhorn Way and people watch for a while Grab a corn dog or a churro or a turkey leg and take a seat Watch the guests going by Better yet take some time and watch for the sweeper Be sure to say hello ---Mike Salutations and best wishes for a healthy happy safe and productive new year to all four of you loyal readers It is kinda silly to have a site meter to track my mom and three other people but what the heck it was a free application Since we tend to look back here at Jungle there 's no better way to start the new year than to compare 1980s Tomorrowland with its present counterpart The photograph below shows the east side of Tomorrowland viewed from the upper bullpen area of Space Mountain in 1985 Bright primary colors catch the eye from the Monorail to the Skyway to the America Sings building and even the Tomorrowland Terrace umbrellas Palm trees also rose gracefully to the sky perhaps evoking a positive upwardly moving future This same area today ( a touch more crowded ) seems a little off You can really see how Innoventions was kinda slapped together over the old America Sings building Hey They got rid of the flag poles and replaced them with---a triangle thingy Now there 's also a big wet ball in the mi le of the walkway Not sure why Further they ve a ed a green tower to the skyline ( over at the Autopia ) and replaced a nice shady spot near the old America Sings building with one that 's a little less shady Stainless steel handrails have become brass or rust-colored too And what exactly has taken over the old Rocket Jets platform to the upper left of the photo DirecTV Dish Network Enough of that Next I share with you a 1985 view of Carnation Plaza Gardens and a link to an old post about this location This photograph was taken by a guest during Park operating hours in early 1985 Imagine open empty space within Disneyland Trust me it can happen Finally let 's close with a fun shot of several 1985 cast members perched above the moat at the entrance to Sleeping Beauty 's Castle See Cast members have fun at Disneyland too That I can assuredly and thankfully tell you is one thing about the Park that has not changed over time Here 's to 2010 May each of your lives continue to grow and a new things May there continue to be imagination left in the world ---Mike Ok Ok I know---it 's been a month since my last post I have been shall we say remiss But hey this isn t Julie amp Julia or even Mike amp Walt I never promised to post every single day or to cook every dish in Julia Child 's first cookbook over the course of a year Still if you re gonna be a blogger I guess you have to actually blog occasionally Even if you have but four (4) count them four (4) readers to your name I have seen somewhere that Jungle is 101 is described as being a bit on the nostalgic side That 's like saying the Boy Scouts are a bit on the help-an-old-lady-to-cross-the-street-and-learn-how-to-tie-really-good-knots 's ide I confess when it comes to the Park nostalgia is my game ( though I do seem to recall a post or two relating to my most recent stint as a cast member ) Thanks to the magic of the Internet I ve been able to come across many old photographs from my first tour of duty at the Park Today we peek at a few more starting with the Jungle Cruise crew from 1986-87-ish ( thanks to Sue B for originally sharing this photo ) Two of my favorite old skippers ( Jimm and Dougg ) ( they insist on the double consonants ) a pictured in the group below ( Jimm to the far left and Dougg smack in the mi le ) See The hats the costumes the canopies the old seat cushions 7 cast members on a single boat (d oing absolutely nothing but posing for a picture )--- Jungle at its finest I remember the macrame-style belts were a bit cheesy but overall we cut a fine form in our Jungle gear eh In our next photograph we have old-time skipper Wally taking a zip around the rivers of Adventureland on the world famous 's kiff I worked a lot of parade shifts and Mark Twain with Wally He was a great Jungle captain Back in the day they actually trusted us skippers ( at least a few of us anyway ) to pilot a boat through the Jungle that was not connected to the riverbed Imagine Of course our old lead (D on ) was known to pilot an unwitting skipper or two (s eated at the front of the skiff ) directly under Schweitzer falls for a ceremonial jungle baptism ( one of several preferred forms of the ritual---others included the squirter the falls the Spur side the unload the front switch the rear switch the it 's clear to cross the bow ( and then throttle into reverse su enly )\ to name but a few ) Of course after several times around the Jungle ( or more if the rest of your rotation was mad at you for taking an extended break ) you would retire to one of the many premier break areas available to Disneyland Cast Members Each break area came stocked with (1) a 40-year old vending machine ( complete with 40-year old snacks inside ) (2) an inoperative change machine ( that would instantly spit back any type of bill one attempted to feed into it---from a crisp newly minted greenback to the more common crumpled single ) (3) a bench or table ( usually orange for some reason ) and (4) a videogame In a photograph below ( originally shared byfrom Lee S ) we see a fellow Thunder cast member ( Henry D ) enjoying a few mushroom-shooting moments with Centipede ( with an inoperative brown change machine in the background ) The old Thunder costumes were also pretty cool ( though the boots would absolutely KILL your feet after a typical shift ) Some attractions actually permitted the cast member to be both on the clock AND taking a break AT THE SAME TIME This wonder of the modern workplace was available in many forms around the Park but none so perfect as the Tiki Room Here ( in another Lee S photo---thanks Lee ) we see a graphic demonstration of the work / break principle in its purest form with Dave P as our Tiki Room attraction operator Uh Dave first you wake up Jose and now THIS By the way I think that same chair is STILL at Tiki ( though now it 's in the office in the back and not on stage as depicted above ) The photograph of Dave also brings back memories of the Tiki costume Slacks and an orange Hawaiian shirt made entirely of polyester Those pants would literally tear the hair off of your legs They also would not breathe Nice combo once July and August hit let me tell you We close today 's post with a 1986 photograph ( again thanks to Lee S ) of Jeff Cravello at the turnstile position leading to the Tiki lanai It looks like the sun is setting and the lights are coming up in Adventureland Soon Jeff will be hearing the drums of the Tahitian Terrace show rumbling into action behind him Very 80s specs Jeff is sporting no Okay there is one thing I do NOT miss about 1980s Adventure / Frontier Attractions Tiki polyester It took 25 years but the hair finally has grown back on the front of my thighs Sheesh Oh and in case I don t post between now and then may each of you have a safe happy and Merry Christmas Jungle Bells Jungle Bells Jungle all the way Oh what fun it is to run from an elephant about to spray Hey ---Mike Ah the old Jungle queue and entrance Thanks to old Skipper Ed Cunningham for originally sharing the shot below from 1983 You can see we were a different class of Jungle skippers back then---very well turned out indeed This group looks like they just got back from the Banana Ball and they haven t even left yet By the way dig the prototype for the new Small World boat at the bottom of the photo---this design never caught on for some reason In scrounging around trying to locate old photographs from back in the day I found one showing Arthur on Main Street from 1983 or 84 ( thanks to my old sweeper pal Robin Mora for originally sharing this picture ) If you weren t around Disneyland when Arthur was a regular well hopefully this will help you understand a little of what he was like Let us now raise our glasses To Arthur To Arthur Here Here ---Mike

karma ) Karma is the condition created by the choice It 's important to remember The choices we make in every moment will determine the kind of opportunities and experiences we will have in the future If someone treats us badly we must respond with kindness and understanding ( turn the other cheek as Jesus suggested ) in order to generate good karma for the future If we retaliate and do something unkind in return the cycle of negative karma will continue and even escalate An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind as Gandhi said ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- A tingling in the air What is this feeling Static electricity all about me It has a fresh air smell to it Ah I believe I read about this This thing called Karma I am not concentrating on anyone noticing but me Other 's and they know who they are will soon see if not already Truth is in the eye of the beholder Actions speek louder than words All these phrases written by people whom personally experience them I wonder what I will write I ll stick to Karma comes a callin Right now I look upon my sleeping babes with a smile on my face They are beautiful A huge slice of my soul There is it again this tingling feeling the smell of peacefulness The knowledge of knowing my truths and convictions I know what is important Keep my course Everything that goes around comes around Those that choose to do good to better themselves for others to remove oneself from negative surroundings Well they will find peace and happiness Those that fail to recognize their weaknesses their mistakes Well the cycle is a vicious one Namaste Jen http // www nameyourdreamassignment com / the-ideas / Sadandbeautiful /

the museum the one you stand in front of and see more than one image the first image you see is beautiful stand there for awhile and you see another distorted picture How can such a kindhearted person deceive you What has he suffered to make this monster appear before you How can you know He hides behind his ghosts every second of his existence After some pro ing it becomes more c l e a r pressure to be someone you are not on the inside moving from place to place when you need solid ground to grow out at sea for months on end was that man on the gurney screaming out in pain going to be okay how did that happen go child this is not your place to be find a hiding place escaping to my canvas subject ANYTHING a bird landed on the deck what is in its mouth is that a fish Immersed into a place of your birth at a time of instability and confusion How old am I today Traveling on a bus full of dreams Where is my pencil and paper Why did we stop Who are these angry men in uniforms Let me go I do not belong among you I am not of the age see my papers Falling in daldrums of chaos and forced to fight in a conflict that I do not fully understand Months of war and death images like slow clicks of a camera Images I wish can be erased from my mind Is this man I am sleeping next to breathing Are you alive close my eyes I am not here Woke up in a military hospital with a bullet in my leg I have to go back what do you mean I have satisfied my duty Returning to the states America the land where they take everyting for granted Do they even know what is going on just south of them Fighting back my ghosts everyday I find my true love only to be deceived I ve given you everything Who is this man What about our child A burning passion deep inside I have to exalt the pain the memories Where is my brush Where is my bottle e m p t y Test it anyway got a taste When did I drink that Days merge into weeks Weeks merge into months My trials of normality responsibility PuRpOsE Failing with each tilt of the head burning in my throat and belly Can t drive anymore Can t pay my bills Who was that girl Surrounding myself with soul sappers People like me looking for purpose and not finding it Drowning

Wake Up Call is a free short story posted by me your insomniac host Cheeseburger Brown Alternative Formats Kindle iPad Connected Stories Simon of Space And now the complete tale I Drillard dreamed He could tell because nothing seemed real His mother pulled him upright while his head lolled then shoved aside his te y bear and tugged off his pajamas She was talking but Drillard couldn t make out a word of it He was lost in the smell of his childhood bedroom drooping under a warm blanket of nostalgia disappearing again behind collapsing eyelids Mommy The alarm clock was buzzing His mouth was tacky with the taste of wine The venetian blinds cast stripes of sunlight across the ceiling but they were too bright to look at Drillard rolled into the pillow muffling away the sounds of traffic whizzing by outside The pillow smelled like Pauline He looked up with a gasp but she wasn t there How could she be He was no more a married man than he was a child No No it was raining Pittering on the ceiling washing down the windows Drillard propped himself up on one elbow to watch it the distorted images of cars smearing past He wiped his hand down his face He dug sand out of the corners of his eyes Brushing his teeth before the mirror he paused to wonder at his face Mother Mars he sighe dwhen did I get to look so haggard He bathed he shaved he shat He pulled on his pants and looked for his hat He barked his shin on the coffee table because he d forgotten all about it It had been a part of his life so very long ago after all Drillard paused at the doorway key in his hand hovering He felt like he was forgetting something II The day was dim the fat jovian disc Yasu occluding half the sky Drillard stared at its swirls as he swayed standing on the train He held a loop of leather hemmed in by his damp fellows Strings of advertising text marched at eye-level along the windows Pleasantly the train cooe dPilgrim Landing Pilgrim Landing Station is the next stop A chime sounded the doors parted and Drillard was expectorated A dozen umbrellas unfolded around him with a series of pops My umbrella -- I should ve remembered my umbrella he said to himself but the realization did not assuage his insistent sense of something forgotten He gathered the lapels of his coat and hunkered his shoulders to sink down into the collar The city was a vast grey beast towering all around him the tips of its spires lost to mist lines of dim traffic snaking between them Each building had a thousand glowing eyes Every artery was clogged with viscous streams of umbrella tops Too many people in too close quarters elbowing their way to their stalls Ishtar was a crowded world The rain irritated him The gravity felt too heavy today making him sluggish He couldn t keep himself from yawning again and again He found himself lingering aside of the commuter mob when his eye was caught by a glittering storefront display Others shouldered past him but Drillard remained transfixed It wasn t new -- he d passed it many times before -- but this morning it seemed to have a special transfixative quality that inspired in Drillard a bewildering but welcome calm The animated letters said PEOPLE LIKE YOU BEGIN NEW HISTORIES Beneath the headline was a great holographic globe with half its sphere composed of cratered rock while the other was a fractal splatter of blue seas and green continents Various points of interest were highlighted The one currently crawling into view indicated a prairie city founded by Ishtari expatriates their smiling faces enclosed in little circles As the circles came near they spoke I never thought I would find myself the mayor of new world colony but here I am and loving it The backdrop was a continually updating spreadsheet of available jobs listing salary benefits contract length and living conditions There were calls for terraforming engineers atmospheric scientists power plant workers civil architects gardiners pilots preschool teachers dentists and barbers and smiths I d go myself if I had a trade 's aid a vagrant sitting beneath the display But that ship has sailed Drillard looked down at him The man held up a filthy cup Drillard dropped a few pennies inside Cheapskate 's narled the vagrant Drillard turned away and walked on rejoining the throng Its current carried him to work He jammed himself into an elevator with too many other people The car creaked as it ascended The climb took a very very long time Normally nervous Drillard wondered why he felt no fear Only numbness People on the elevator had the same conversations as people on the train The talk was a hypnotic sussurussing rhythm of platitudes and slogans and misquoted excerpts of popular entertainments -- a lullabye of inanity Drillard found himself sagging into the man next to him then shook himself and straightened Sorry he mumbled He pinched himself inside his pocket to stifle the next yawn III Keeping you up Drilly Drillard 's head rocketed up from his desk leaving behind a modest pool of drool He knuckled his sockets and cleared his throat then smoothed down his shirtfront and wiped away the saliva with a sleeve Nearly scared the faeces out of me Mona That 's what you get for sleeping on the job 's he teased wagging a finger at him She peeled off her slick overcoat and tucked herself in behind the desk opposite Drillard 's with a flip of her long brown hair Late night Hot date What 's aid Drillard blinking Oh God no I don t know I just feel like I can t wake up all the way today like I 'm looking at the world from under a wet blanket Everything 's a bit woolly Mona no ed sympathetically but instead of setting to work at her terminal she leaned across the desk and pointed a small flashlight directly at Drillard 's eye She clicked it on with her thumb unleashing a blaze of brightness Slightly asymmetric pupil response 's he said in a clinical voice Drillard winced batting her hand away Damn it he grunted What the hell did you do that for My eyes are killing me God Mona Mona looked up at him blankly hands poised over her terminal I 'm sorry What 's with the go amn light She raised a single eyebrow mouth pinched She glanced up at the overhead lights Are you feeling alright Drill I can signal an iteration of the nurseplex if you want He waved that off Forget it I ll be fine You re pale He tried to summon a hopeful grin Maybe I d feel better if you bought me dinner She chuckled but it wasn t unkind If this is the hangover you have after a date with a mere mortal what makes you think you could even survive stepping out with the likes of me I 'm not hungover Mona You look like you re about to faint Drillard pinched the bridge of his nose and closed his eyes He took a deep breath and let it out slowly When I was a teenager he said into the ru y darkness behind his lids I used to be able to sleep in all morning long Remember that I d sort of surface look at my clock and then dip back under and have a million more dreams The next time I d come up only five minutes had passed and my parents were still yelling at me to get up and mow the damn lawn Sure 's aid Mona softly I remember that Sometimes I d dream that I d already woken up he said It could be unsettling When Mona did not reply he opened his eyes again Rivulets of bent light ran along the ceiling the rain casting strange caustics between the blinds The pressure against the back of Drillard 's head was not his chair but rather his pillow He was horizontal Traffic moaned and swooped and chittered by outside his high-rise window Drillard 's alarm clock was buzzing IV Neurologically I don t see anything amiss Dr Salts turned away from the tomographic display as the gurney Drillard lay upon withdrew from inside the scanning drum Drillard sat up as soon as his head had cleared the edge He looked at the rotating image of his brain the most oxygenated regions glowing gaily blue What does it mean Doc It means your issues are not organic in origin Drillard sagged So I 'm cracking up Dr Salts raised his brow It may simply mean that you re under an unusual amount of stress Would you like me to subscribe you to an analyst construct It may help to talk about it Drillard shook his head I just want something to stop me from feeling so drowsy and detached A medicine -- there must be a medicine I can take I 'm sorry Mr Drillard but I do not condone the prescription of pharmacological solutions without an accompanying regimen of counselling It would be irresponsible you understand to a ress your symptoms without attempting to correct the underlying problem Drillard sighed then jerked awake The train cooe dNorth Central Medical North Central Medical Complex is the next stop He pushed his way through the passengers and staggered out onto the platform In his hand was clutched his appointment chit for Dr Salt 's office He looked up at the grand public clock at the end of the platform but decided against rushing Was there any point in sprinting for an appointment he had just dreamed he had already had Was the real Dr Salt likely to tell him anything much different than the imaginary one Drillard chucked the chit into the garbage then changed his mind and went after it fishing his hand through wet filth until he d retrieved it When he arrived at Dr Salt 's office he was quickly disabused of the notion that he might be somehow precognitive as Dr Salt was on vacation and his appointments were being handled by a fill-in Her name was Dr Sen I don t see any neurological issues in your scan 's he said long brown fingers folded on her blotter And your bloodwork is normal In light of this I 'm not convinced your problem is somatic Have you considered psychotherapy Yeah he said no ing vaguely Twice actually The analyst construct downloaded itself into his home console just as Drillard was finishing supper He pushed his plate aside turned off the soccer game and then watched the progress bar fill on the display A chime sounded Good evening 's aid a smoothly modulated artificial voice Tell me about your mother Afterward he went to a bar After that he found himself knocking on an unfamiliar apartment door He was as surprised as anyone when Mona answered Drilly Can I come in he mumbled already moving forward She sat cross-legged on the sofa in pink pajamas a mug of steaming tea between her thighs Drillard paced back and forth in front of the wide wall of windows that overlooked the city 's bright core So basically the damn thing tells me I hate my job I 'm sick of my life and if I don t want to get stuck in a cycle of worsening depression I ve got to make some big changes Mona furrowed her brow arms crossed What kind of changes Drill I mean you ve applied for employment amelioration like ten times What else can you do Retrain What would you study He licked his lips still pacing Maybe I should just leave Leave Where would you go Out East Offworl dhe replied eyes flashing Maybe I could go offworld Mona drew in her breath sharply Drillard couldn t be sure but it seemed to him that there was something almost impressed in her expression Hesitantly she sai o you really think you re cut out for that kind of life He snorted Well clearly I 'm not cut out for this one Just ask the go amn analyst construct Tell me about your mother That 's not funny She opened a bottle of wine explaining it had been set aside for a date who had stood her up Drillard heard himself say that seemed unlikely She shrugged as she poured out two glasses Don t bothering buttering me up 's he replied tartly setting the bottle back on the table You know full well I 'm lightyears out of your league Drill I 'm not trying to be mean It 's just the truth Drillard no ed Yeah I know No matter how you shake it I 'm B-3 and you re C-5 and my mama taught me to never fool around outside my genetic cohort He no ed again Yeah I guess when everything feels like a dream it just seems like anything might be possible It 's the underappreciated upshot of losing your grip She offered him a wan smile and reached out to touch his shoulder Poor Drilly If you ever did kiss me you know what would happen don t you You d wake right up The snapped her fingers then tried to force a laugh He glanced down You re falling out of your pajamas Mona turned pink and hit him with a pillow Go home Drill 's he said crossing her arms over her chest again It 's late Sure he agreed draining his glass Thanks for listening He turned around and scooped up his jacket from the floor and when his head came up again he banged it hard against the upper edge of the scanning drum Damn it he bellowed stars winking through his vision Dr Sen was peering in at him Mr Drillard have you hurt yourself Drillard said an unprintable word as the gurney slid out of the scanner He sat up all the way and rubbed at his throbbing forehead When he opened his eyes again Dr Sen was staring at him splayed out on the gurney with his hospital chemise tented impressively over his erection He crossed his legs quickly How long was I out Out echoed Dr Sen But you ve only just gone into the scanner Drillard pressed his lips together grimly Something serious is happening to me doctor I know it he whispered I just wish I could remember what it is V Wake up Drillard groaned Wake up God damn you wake up Drill He smelled baby powder and sex He opened his eyes He was curled up in a twisted piece of pink comforter Along the headboard mineral water exfoliating facial scrubs cinnamon massage oil Standing over him Mona with a silk sheet clutched against her front What 's tammered Drillard Oh my God 's hrieked Mona What did you put in my wine you bastard But we didn t do anything -- you sent me home remember Mona snatched up a pair of pants and began flogging at him with them Liar 's he cried face screwed up tightly in fury I can t believe this I can t believe you I can t believe my own friend -- we ve been friends for three years Drill -- my own friend would take advantage of me like this I hate you Drillard tried to shield himself as she started picking up random things from the floor and lobbing them at his head I didn t do anything he pled taking a shoe to the temple as gracefully as he could manage I 'm ovulating you idiot Do you know what this means I 'm B-fornicating-3 Drillard 's mouth went dry You can abort They won t even give you a hassle because I 'm just C-5 You can say I forced you You did force me She punched him the face Drillard rolled backward off the bed and hit the wall upsetting a vanity and sending vials of cosmetics crashing in all directions He tasted blood Stop he wailed I thing you broge by node Naked and furious Mona wrenched the fallen vanity up over her head Before Drillard could object she swung it down upon him He had raised one arm defensively and it was this arm he felt break first Then the bulk of the furniture careened into his head and everything went dark and awful Beep Drillard stirred Beep His eyes opened slightly admitting a painful light He slowly gained awareness of a body as heavy as weak When he lolled his head he heard the crisp whispers of a starched pillow against his ears Beep A white room Sun-dappled leaf shadows spread along the wall Sickly sweet smell of old flowers A machine at his elbow reporting audibly on his respiration Beep The smell of disinfectant and cologne vomit and ozone Tinny voices paging specialists Doctor Mr Drillard is ready for your examination Two long faces looked in over Drillard his own pallid and slack features reflected in their cold eyes Together they discussed his bowel movements and glucose levels then one of them drew out a little flashlight and clicked it on with his thumb as he pointed it first into Drillard 's left eye then his right Drillard was trapped inside himself He could neither move nor speak I d like to test the gag response Heart rate is elevating Show me the realtime cochlear data Is he hearing us Drillard 's rehabilitation began immediately He was weak as a kitten He was propped up on pillows with an intravenous line attached to his ludicrously skinny arm and asked many simple questions like whether he felt up to counting backwards from twenty or if he could recite the alphabet He tired quickly He would protest against his heavy lids I can do a few more I just want to stay awake You ve spent a long time in a very deep coma Mr Drillard Please let us set the pace There was a television in the hospital ward and the lady in the next bed over liked to keep it tuned to a popular situation comedy about a young urban professional called Ishtar is Your Oyster Mona Farmer Drillard wore a faraway sad expression as he watched the sexy brunette starlet cavort on screen Everyone else in the ward laughed uproariously at the dumb jokes Physiotherapy was hard You need to find something to fight for urged his therapist as Drillard was crumpled panting at the base of the treadmill You need to want to get back to your life My wife left me he croaked forlornly When you re well again you can meet somebody new I 'm C-5 There are plenty of C-5 women around Not everybody wants to spend their life having babies you know What do you think you might want to do once you re up and at it again He grimaced tasting the metal bar against his mouth I don t know You need a dream Mr Drillard You can t strive without a dream VI Yasu was setting The shadow of her giant rings cut through the swirls of cloud visible on her broad limb above the treetops The sky beyond was purple and pinpricked with the evening 's first stars a chorus around Proxima The opposite horizon burned golden as Centauri Prime rolled out of view Birds chirped Drillard sat on a bench an intravenous bag hanging on a wheeled stand beside him Orderlies were helping the other patients inside from the garden Drillard awaited his turn lazily watching streams of traffic clot and stretch over the city the amber glow of Centauri Secundae lighting up the bellies of the clouds as it rose A monk walked over and took a seat next to him Do you mind Drillard shook his head Feel free You ll have the whole bench to yourself in a minute or two The orderlies are coming to float me back to my room I wouldn t mind chatting in the meantime You re Trenton Drillard aren t you Drillard no ed That 's me The monk 's brow was sloped with concern his face etched by years of similar compassions My name is Brother Necker he said I 'm a Zorannite volunteer with the hospital We haven t spoken before Drillard shrugged I 'm not really religious The monk smiled carelessly No I suppose you re not an observant man so far as that goes But it is my understanding that you re experiencing a particularly religious predicament You ve been misinformed I was just in a coma And suffering persistent delusions of awakening isn t that right Drillard conceded a nod Well all but the last one were delusions I guess I 'm here now aren t I The monk shifted somewhat closer leaning in Then you re altogether convinced that the process is complete This reality -- he said gesturing briefly at their darkening environs -- is the ultimate reality Is that so Drillard hesitated I 'm getting better he said a bit more aggressively than he had planned The construct thinks I 'm just a little shell-shocked from the experience of waking up out of the coma Once burned twice shy -- that kind of thing The doctors say I 'm doing great Brother Necker sat back again his eyes unfocused And yet you don t feel quite wholly yourself I 'm getting better 's aid Drillard again But you have stopped fighting There 's nothing to fight against It 's all been explained to me The monk turned to him seriously his wizened little face glowering with a new hint of menace In that satisfaction lies your doom Mr Drillar dhe said eyes fixed on eyes Su enly he blinked sat back and assumed his previous careless posture He looked up at the sky Have you studied much history Trenton Nobody calls me Trenton replied Drillard carefully watching the monk No he a ed after a moment I mean not really I 'm just a traffic controller What 's this about doom Brother Necker gestured upward The darkening quarter of the sky now admitted the brightest parts of the green and scarlet phantasm of gas every Ishtari knew so well Rome he said pointing out a streamer of fluorescing helium New York he said letting his finger trace sideways across the sky to settle on a patch of ink against a backdrop of glittering stars Paris Every city of the ancient world every road every grave every tree spread out across the sky in dust Sure grunted Drillard noncommitally Everybody knows all about the Solar Nebula Our race fled in the face of that calamity -- that you know well too -- and it was just a single ark that reached this Second Earth Of those that set out only a single generation ship arrived Right agreed Drillard What many people don t appreciate is that after the accident -- after we were separated from the others -- a whole generation arose on our ark that was utterly ignorant of their situation Can you imagine that They consulted our oldest books and found facts described therein that had virtually no correlation to the reality in which they found themselves They had to wonder why the ancestors thought things like the sky were so important when there was evidently no such thing Drillard shifted Disorienting Worse 's aid Brother Necker gravely It nearly drove them psychotic Our history nearly ended right there and then You see a man cannot live when he has no trust in his world Imagine waking yourself out of ignorance to find a source of knowledge which seems to contradict everything that seems reasonable until a further stage of awakening is achieved So was for them the wisdom of the ancestors made no sense until we made planetfall Drillard frowned then glanced over his shoulder to see if could spot an orderly What 's your point The monk leaned in close again Clarity is seeking you he said seriously You in turn must seek clarity At that union all these bewildering fragments will assemble into a sensible whole and wisdom will be yours You can and must awaken to this truth my son Centauri Secundae had risen Drillard studied the star absently hearing the monk shift beside him Finally he muttere dSo what would you have me do Sacrifice a goat Meditate under a baobab Shelter orphans Swim my son You must simply swim And as he said this Drillard saw that the nebula above them was running and twisting with distortion as its light was filtered through the undulating surface of a sea The stars the clouds the satellites -- of them seemed to be refracting down to him through a liquid sky The city wavered like weeds on the ocean floor and su enly Drillard 's lungs ached for air He was floating We re having cherry gelatin tonight 's aid the orderly But Drillard was far above him now clawing and kicking his way through the thick aether toward the lights of heaven He strained his fingertips toward the vault desperate now to break the surface and breathe again Upward ever upward Drillard surged toward the shining orb of Secundae VII With a start Drillard realized that he had failed to complete his mathematics homework He looked up at the teacher and quailed inside the taste of bile at the back of his throat Stand up Mr Drillard Drillard stood up He felt cold He looked down and saw to his horror that he was stark naked All the other kids pointed and laughed Drillard fell upon himself folding in half to cover his genitals and avert his eyes He tried to roll into a little ball where there on the waxed linoleum floor He pressed his fists into his eyes and willed the world to melt away Trenton dear you ll be late for school But I 'm already at school He saw that he wasn t He was in his bed beside Pauline drawing little circles of tickle on her exposed hip as his mother busied herself about the bedroom putting stuffed toys back on the shelf and hucking sports-themed underwear into the dirty laundry bin Honestly this room is a sty Could you just give me a minute Mom so I can have sex with Pauline one last time before the divorce Of course dear but please have a bit of breakfast first She made spaceship sounds as she flew each spoonful of hot oatmeal into his mouth and then used the edge of the spoon to wipe away the excess Drillard obediently opened for the next helping Pauline exhaled loudly and rolled her eyes Just a sec honey he mumbled around his food I 'm almost done here You re no pioneer 's neered Pauline There 's no ceiling on what I can be Polly You can t be a father No not to children I guess not But maybe to something else People like me begin new histories you know He was distracted by the fat thick-lipped man sitting on the end of the bed His hands looked like a child 's hands -- pink and soft and tiny He adjusted his tie with those tiny hands then cleared his phlegm The process is completely safe Mr Drillard let me assure you Modern hibernation techniques ensure a senseless journey and an easy transition back to consciousness upon arrival at your destination Failing a major breakthrough in propulsion hibernation really is the only viable option for making an interplanetary trip of this magnitude Has it ever gone wrong asked Drillard pushing aside his mother 's hand Have you ever lost anyone The fat man bit his own plump lip I must be frank with you Mr Drillard just under one tenth of one percent of hibernators may experience a challenging wake Drillard cocked his head as he stroked his ex-wife 's hip What 's that mean There have been cases -- rare cases isolated cases -- in which a very small number of hibernators have descended into a steady-state of extreme sleep reluctant to re-admit reality when the time comes It may be a defense mechanism against neurological injury real or perceived not entirely unlike a coma I must emphasize again however that such cases are exceedingly few and far between But what happens to them We have several interventions at our disposal to aid the recovery Like what The fat man su enly seized Drillard by the face and pulled him bodily across the bed then shoute dWake up with spittle-flecked vehemence VIII Drillard awoke He sat up and puked White robots were at his side in an instant the pads of their fingers soft and warm Please lie down 's aid one in a melodiously sexless contralto as it wiped strings of yellow bile from his lips Please do not resist 's aid the other pushing him back into the pillows Focus on slowing your breathing Passenger Drillard In and out In and out Drillard turned his head He saw an intravenous drip attached to his arm Beyond that his eyes could not focus well -- blearily he could discern row after row of hibernation capsules Those closest to him were splayed open like spring flowers those further away were in the process of slowly opening Hundreds of white robots tended to the dazed cargo their calming voices blending into a comforting drone A human physician stepped up beside him and checked the readouts The badge on her white coat identified her as Dr Sen She took a little flashlight out of her pocket and pointed it into each of his eyes in turn How are you feeling Mr Drillard 's he asked clicking the flashlight off with her thumb Drillard blinked Dreams he said voice husky And then How long Dr Sen no ed Perfectly normal You ve been in hibernation for nearly seventeen years He managed to just barely shake his head the pillow rustling in his ears No -- how long have I been waking up She glanced up at his capsule 's readout again then shot a cuff and checked her watch Um we started the wake routine about let 's see an hour ago An hour But I was back on Ishtar -- there were days weeks I kept trying to wake up All of it only one hour She offered him a tight professional smile and patted him on the shoulder Give yourself a few minutes before you stand up Mr Drillard You re doing great Later he loitered in the lounge his bum peeking out the back of his hibernation gown as he sipped orange juice from a plastic cup while staring past his own reflection out the floor-to-ceiling windows The wheel of the galaxy cut the view Off to one side Centauri Secundae blazed and directly ahead was a pale blue crescent standing bright against the bed of stars and smoke Another planet A new world His future home He cried He didn t feel embarrassed -- a fair number of the stunned and largely silent collection of fellow passengers in the lounge were sobbing too Some of them hugged robots The robots patted them gently on the back There there they cooed there there passenger When he had gathered himself somewhat Drillard signalled for service A robot was at his side in seconds Drillard cleared his throat Coffee The robot cocked its head Sir You heard me he snapped turning to look into the thing 's insensible glowing eyes Coffee strong black Caffeine is contraindicated passenger Rest is recommended Rest You ve got to be ki ing me chuckled Drillard He turned back to face space I

One of my former students just introduced me to the Lip Dub phenomenon in which various school communities do an entire music video in one long carefully choreographed shot (s ee my previous post about my desire to assign the students a single shot video ) In a ition to the challenge of choreographing this correctly and coming up with neat ways to use the camera it seems like an excellent way of bringing the whole school community together in a way that celebrates various aspects of school life This is the video that Kai sent me it stands out among the Lip Dubs as it was filmed backwards - similar to Spike Jonze 's music video Drop for the Pharcyde but again all in one shot Searching for LipDub on YouTube produces quite a few results with some really neat ideas and interpretations of the project ( as well as some lousy ones hey it is YouTube ) No how to get the whole school together for a few hours though now there 's an even bigger challenge Thanks Kai Thanks Joe If you re a fan of the still-amazing-25-years-later Rube Goldbergian feat of The Way Things Go you ll be amazed by This Too Shall pass In fact it would be pretty hard not to be impressed by this four minute single-shot music video its not just the amazing contraption but the choreography of camera the machine and the actors all moving together in harmony In a ition to all the obvious amazingness about the video I especially love that the process is the product To me this video really celebrates the act of artistic creation and its a catchy tune Here 's the Wired article about the making of the video Thanks for the link Ben One of my very talented former students sent me some great links that are perfect for any IB Film or Media Lit class Well the Lars Von Treier one might not be perfect for your classroom In fact you might want to make sure its appropriate before sharing it with the students One project that I ve done in the past is to have the students create videos in the style of famous directors These would be perfect examples Wes Anderson 's Spiderman I love the way they mimic both Anderson 's deadpans and camera pans Lars Von Triere 's Denmark Tourism Ads Thanks for those Travis We ve got a new agenda in IB Film today Finally I stumbled across this article that celebrates the art of cinematography with written descriptions of techniques and visuals pulled from YouTube Its a really excellent explanation of the art and a great introduction to film language If you re working on either the Rotoball 2010 or Paint the World with Light projects our deadline is next Monday March 1st If you are a participant and haven t received an email with instructions for uploading from me please send me an email or leave a comment here I ve been fortunate to get a sneak preview of some of the projects that some of you have been working on and let me just say this in advance wow In January 2009 I posted my favorite iTouch / iPhone apps for use in the art classroom Since then I ve found several new apps to be incredibly useful and engaging for the students in a number of different ways Note I have deliberately not included any iPhone apps that require use of the camera Although some of these products look fantastic I don t have an iPhone and thus can t rate them The apps listed below are free or a few dollars at most One of the most useful tools I ve found is Air Mouse Pro This allows me to turn my iTouch into a remote control for my computer- complete with a trackpad and mini keyboard Mostly I use it for presentations it frees me to walk around the class during class discussions and demonstrations However anything you can do on your computer you can now do from anywhere in the class This works much better and is a huge improvement over Remote Pad which I had recommended last year The Oblique Strategies is a digital version of Brian Eno 's card stack for overcoming creative blocks Simple and universally applicable phrases help you think of ways to approach your projects in new ways When I ve been discussing ideas with my students I ve occasionally pulled out the Oblique Strategies to help them dig deeper into their ideas Sometimes it falls flat but sometimes it provides an eerily helpful perspective An alternative to this is an app called Methodology which is basically the same thing ( and might even be a rip-off of the Oblique Strategies but the one advantage to it is that it randomizes the card stack responses Yet another version of this is the Creative Whack Pack This has a nice design and explanation of the suggestions it makes but overall hasn t generated as interesting responses for my classes as the Oblique Strategies has The suggestions are more general ways to think creatively Do you have any projects that include storytelling The Idea Generator ( mentioned here before ) also has an itouch app great for coming up with writing prompts This has worked very well with my film and video classes There is also a Movie Idea Generator but I ve found the suggestions here too convoluted to be developed into workable ideas Although Brushes is David Hockney 's painting app of choice I ve found that Autodesk 's Sketchbook to be a much more intuitive program and easier to manipulate Similarly Layers has an interface like Brushes but has a great visualization for looking at layers as stacked glass slides This is a fantastic way of helping students understand how layers work in programs like Photoshop Flash or Final Cut If you can t get enough of painting programs Asian Painting is also a neat app The interface is made to resemble an ancient calligraphy desk and the brushes all fade appropriately If you are participating in our Paint the World with Light project then Light Painting is a must have app This app allows you to flash different colors at different speeds or simply create a constant colored light brush Also for photographers DOFMaster allows you to quickly check your depth of field range for an SLR or DSLR camera For film students Grat 's Slate is a great application that turns your iTouch into a movie clap board Even though syncing sound and image might not be critical for us (s ince we mostly record both onto the same digital media now ) this is a great way to organize your shots and easily identify your takes in post production Plus it makes your students film shoots seem more professional Although there are too many Museum Apps to mention now its worth downloading these especially if you re planning a visit For example the Brooklyn Museum 's app allows you to find basic information about its collection Who knows what goodies can be found in the apps for the museums in your neighborhood Finally I feel compelled to not recommend Photoshop Mobile because of my extreme disappointment This application bears nothing that resembles Photoshop except in name As a film teacher ( or probably more relevantly a film geek ) I watch just about as many films as I can I often mean to include suggestions of films to watch in class here ( including a constantly changing list of films about artists that every art class should have ) Long story short- I was reading an interview with Danny Boyle when he came here to host the Shanghai International Film Festival last year In response to a question about his favorite Chinese film he mentioned Devils on the Doorstep as one of the best films to come out of China I d never heard of it but as the serendipity gods are always looking out for me I happened to spot it at one of my favorite DVD stores just a day or two after I d read the interview Then it sat on my shelf for a few months I just got around to watching it recently and I have to say that its one of the best films I ve ever seen Its also one of the most surprising films I ve ever seen The movie that you end with is so far from the movie that you started with that its an incredible feat of creativity and vision that the director is able to pull of such a transition The hard thing about recommending a film like this is that I can t say too much about it- what you will appreciate most about this film is the unexpected directions that it takes That being said understand that it is not for the faint hearted taking place during the Japanese occupation of China this film does quite graphically depict some of the horrors of war That being said it is a fascinating film from a cinematic perspective as well as a historical and contemporary socio-cultural perspective Director Jiang Wen has been banned from making any more movies in China Although he is married to a French woman and can work outside of China he refuses His stories he says take place in China and that 's where they are meant to be filmed and shown A Rant The other day I was catching up on some of my news podcasts which are always a day or two late for me ( hey how d that election in Massachusetts turn out ) One of my favorite podcasts is NPR 's On Point with Tom Ashbrook but my one big beef with his show is that in the interest of being fair and balanced ( now there 's a loaded phrase ) he often lets some pretty nutty folks say some pretty nutty things without too much challenge I often wonder if they do this simply to prove that they don t have a liberal bias- The show I was listening to recently was one of those shows In an episode titled Where the Web Went Wrong author Jaron Lanier was on the show promoting his book You Art Not A Gadget -- the central thesis of this is that participatory communities online create a hive mind in which we are sacrificing our creative energies in the service of companies to which we owe nothing In this discussion he lambasts Web 2 0 proponents as religious cultists who contribute their time and energy not for their own personal gain but in the interest of creating a god-like singularity of utopian participation To me this argument reeks of the conservative fear of the commons I like to share my thoughts about art education with the greater community for my own personal interest and all of a su en I 'm handing out flowers at airports and promoting a socialist agenda Well I do live in China after all I can see how that could be confusing to some While some of the points that Lanier makes are just plain wrong and some just plain silly ( and quite often both ) some fall into the realm of the wha One of his most awkward points is that people feel free to 'm ash up the creative efforts of others but that the ads that regularly appear on the sides of the webpages that these mashups appear are somehow sacrosanct and above being modified for creative use This idea is based on two false premises (1) That ads are not mashed because we hold them with some sort of respect and ( b ) there is anything useful in these ads to 'm ash Sidebar ads aren t seen as holy they aren t even seen as useful for a creative endeavor At most I d say they were seen as a minor inconvenience or annoyance In fact I d argue that they aren t even seen at all I don t have ads on this site and if you think back to the last site you were on what were the ads for Do you remember I don t either Further it shows a fundimental misunderstanding about the purpose of a mashup which is to celebrate or satirize the derivative work in a way that creates something that we haven t seen before With a nod to the serendipity gods I happened to find this wonderful Mashup of the movie UP over on the always fascinating Learning IT on the same day that I listened to this podcast I could just listen to that song all day If there is any doubt in your mind that mash-ups are somehow by definition less creative than their derivative works this video should dispel that notion It also should dispel the notion that the creation of projects like this one are in service to some corporate monolith that feeds off of our creative juices Pogo the 21 year old creator of this mash up is now being wooed by corporations to make Mashup videos for them the one above was commissioned by Pixar itself That is not to say that the commissioning of a work validates it above other creative works Lanier is right in one way- that we should be compensated for our creative efforts and hard work However he is mistaken in thinking that everything that we do needs financial compensation If before the internet the quiet creative endeavors that we pursued resulted in only our own satisfaction that was compensation enough Now that everyone has the ability and opportunity to share the processes and products of our creative expression doesn t mean we all need to get a paycheck for everything we do Web 2 0 ( or whatever you want to call it ) isn t where the web went wrong its where the web went right Before the concept of participatory media overtook online activity the internet 's main purpose was another in a long line of the one-to-many forms of media ( h / t to Howard Rheingold ) following radio TV and movies Before web 2 0 tools put content creation in the hands of the masses what was the internet A place to buy all kinds of stuff and occasionally get entertained So basically it was the mall Without all the walking And that was just what we all needed wasn t it More shopping less exercise -Good luck with that Tom --Yeah no I 'm not going to promote it here You can find it with the google 
This morning I had two interesting thoughts The first pertains to a remark I heard by a coworker 13 years ago If heaven is real she said I don t want to go there It would be boring This morning I had a thought that given that God is omnipotent the possibilities for heaven are limitless Specifically one could conceive that each room in the kingdom of heaven might be its own universe with its own space its own galaxies its own planets its own flora and fauna Maybe not exactly like that but that 's one possibility that shows what an amazing and interesting place it will be No Sarah heaven will not be boring The second thought was about the idea of multiple universes that is currently fashionable If there are other universes can one universe visit the inhabitants of another universe Probably not which is sad But perhaps we will see each other in the kingdom of heaven That is another reason why heaven will not be boring Today I take up as my life 's mission the following phrase from The Imitation of Christ Book II Chapter 1 nbsp nbsp nbsp nbsp To prepare a worthy dwelling for Christ in my heart This philosophy is applicable to any state in life We take whatever comes our way and use it to prepare our hearts as a dwelling for Christ If there is trouble in the family or at work or in friendship we treat it as a sharing in the suffering of Christ When we see others better off than us we do not envy them having forsaken the riches of the world to prepare our hearts for Christ If we are ill and confined to a bed for the remainder of our years we use the time profitably in prayer to prepare our hearts to receive Christ In this way we attain peace in times of prosperity and in times of affliction Pope Benedict XVI :\ Dear brothers and sisters I urge you to find in this Lenten Season prolonged moments of silence possibly in retreat in order to review your own lives in the light of the loving plan of the heavenly Father Angelus Second Sunday of Lent 8 March (1 st Sunday of Lent St Andrew 's Cathedral Victoria BC ) Rainbow as announcement of God 's mercy Even if man falls into sin God will not destroy the earth Christ fulfills this covenant Harrowing of Hell purgatory Another sign of mercy Baptism more than ritual a sacrament of mercy through which we are saved Also a gift of holiness as it unites us to God Also a task to live in a way befitting this gift Temptation is especially strong in times of holiness such as the Lenten season We must persevere Realize the love and forgiveness of Christ Spread the joy of Christ Went to Confession today and Father Benoit ended with quot God bless you and be happy quot Will do If anyone is using Instiki 0 10 2 and wants the Export Markup (T extile ) link to work make the following changes to the source code / app / controllers / application rb Insert options [:s tream = false at line 66 options [: type = ( FILE_TYPES File extname ( file )] application / octet-stream ) options [:s tream = false super ( file options ) / app / controllers / wiki_controller rb Insert require zip / zip at line 4 require parsedate require zip / zip class WikiController How does one live well Or what makes a day well lived Is it to eat well drink well and be glad To pray in a silent room To build sandcastles beneath blue skies To create How does one live well if one were shut up in a cell with no food No materials no books no light Just hunger and thoughts and pain philosophy religion contemplation emotion meditation and confusion What makes a day well lived Or is it better to consider a week Or a month or a year or a lifetime Is it better not to consider it at all but to live haphazardly from one inclination to the next going by feel gut recollection remonstrance rebuke appetite On what can we ground our living On what motto creed or ideal Shall poetry lead us or some ancient script a philosopher from Greece or Rome a symphony a painting an epitaph Shall we lose ourselves in language or in study in literature physics studying the cosmos Will we find our salvation in the order and reason of mathematics How does one live well Or what makes a day well lived Is it to eat well drink well and be glad To pray in a silent room To build sandcastles beneath blue skies To create 
OFFICIAL RESULTS 1 Dayron ROBLES CUB 7 34 CR 2 Terrence TRAMMELL USA 7 36 NR 3 David OLIVER USA 7 44 PB 4 Evgeniy BORISOV RUS 7 51 SB 5 Petr SVOBODA CZE 7 58 6 Maurice WIGNALL JAM 7 60 SB 7 Xiang LIU CHN 7 65 SB 8 Dániel KISS HUN 7 81 I went out in the final of the World Indoor Championships and ran 60 meters worth of hurdles faster than I had ever run before I stopped the clock at 7 44 good enough for the bronze medal behind a new championship record from Dayron Robles who ran 7 34 for gold and Terrence Trammel who finished in silver with an American record of 7 36 To backtrack I did not run very well in my semi final heat finishing second in 7 61 I made a few mistakes especially at the start I wasn t too upset or anything because the bottom line is you have to survive and advance through the rounds By finishing second I grabbed an automatic spot to the final After going back to the warm up area Brooks and I had the chance to work out a few things that went wrong with my trigger hand out of the blocks It was sweeping back aggressively but I wouldn t bring it back through so that was the point of emphasis in the 45 minutes I had before the final Having your coach or at least another set of well trained eyes is so priceless at major competitions like this So due to my lackluster semi final performance I drew lane eight Going in to the final I was so relaxed My focus was to try to beat Liu to the first hurdle and just run like hell for the final four because I would be out there racing by myself I feel like I had a good start and I ended up running a clean race I can t wait to re watch the race One thing that I knew I had on my side was the fact that my second race is ALWAYS better than my first of the day I knew only a few others in the race have displayed that ability in the past and the comparison of our times from the semi final to the final display just that Robles dropped 22 (7 56-7 34 ) Terrence 15 (7 51-7 36 ) and myself 17 (7 61-7 44 ) Everyone else in the field so minor improvement Winning this medal was so sweet Coming off the devastating injury last year not doing block starts or heavy hurdling until two weeks before my race in Glasgow to coming out and winning an indoor medal and running a personal best I couldn t have asked for more We have a saying that all indoors can do is show you where outdoors is at and I 'm feeling majorly confident that this will be a GREAT outdoor season People who know the event of hurdling know that what I do indoor definitely reflects well on what I am capable of doing outdoor because I am a last five hurdle guy not a starter I 'm so ready to get outdoor season poppin First round action from all five preliminary heats The first round went as me and Brooks planned The objective for this round was to attack the first two hurdles and then just take it easy after that My start was much better than it has been lately and I led from start to finish and stopped the clock at 7 60 equal fastest time of all runners today Terrance Trammel also ran 7 60 in his heat I felt very good the warm up was great and I felt so much more relaxed and loose here as opposed to when I ran in New Mexico I think I was kind of tight for that competition Ron Forbes was in my heat he lived and trained with me for the 08- 09 season before moving back to Miami it 's good seeing him still competing he also made it to the next round People seem to be counting me out in this competition as they seem to believe it is just a three man race between Trammel Robles and Liu Xiang rightfully so but I guess that 's why we run the races and I hope to have a say in it before it all is said and done I know I am a much better outdoor hurdler than an indoor one but as long as we aren t doing starts to the first hurdle to decide the medals I feel I have as good a chance as anyone to claim one of them I am off until the semi-finals on Sunday afternoon the finals will be two hours after the semis I am in the third and final heat Until then I will keep my eyes on the prize My training partner Novlene Williams-Mills made it to the final of the 400 which will be tomorrow afternoon The schedule called for them to run prelims and semi-finals today She ran 51 7 and has the second fastest time going to the finals she ll definitely do well tomorrow As I type this post it is a little after 10pm local time an eight hour time difference from the cozy confines of the first house on Emerald Green Ct My body is almost in shut down mode The internet is pretty spotty in our apartments but nonetheless I got some action The downside is that I don t know how much of my Slingbox I will be able to watch while out here so I am going to be WAY out of the loop Constant Blackberry messages to Aub will keep me slightly up to date I left home Sunday at 4 30 and arrived here in Doha at 7pm Monday evening Most of the U S team arrived here last Thursday I felt that ten days ahead of the final was far too much time to be in this environment personally I would have been here stir crazy plus I know my personal countdown seeing that this is the fourth year I have made the trip out here to Doha to compete in some capacity Usually I would get here on Monday night and have to race Wednesday night With that in mind I have produced times of 13 14 13 09 and 12 95 outdoors with that schedule Granted this is a championship but I try to treat every meet just like it 's a regular competition no need in trying to reinvent the wheel right I travel well so I ll be fine The athletes village they have here is the best village I ve been in out of all the team I made We are in apartments high jumper Jesse Williams is my roommate here feels funny because this is the first team I ve been on without my boy Kenta Bell The facilities are great here real state of the art The amazing thing is that gas cost 33 cents a gallon I really need to fill up a couple of barrels and bring them back with me to the States My first round goes off on Friday afternoon I 'm feeling great and ready to compete I will have a pre race update before we go off Things out in Albuquerque went as planned I finished second in my hurdle race behind Terrence Trammell who ran a world leading time of 7 41 That finish qualified me for the World Indoor Championships in Doha my fourth World Championship / Olympic team qualification I still get amazed at the accomplishments I have made in my track and field career I would have never believed all this would come about when I was in college with no aspirations of doing anything track related as a career I guess I had a string of second place finishes throughout the weekend Second fastest prelim time second fastest semi-final time and a second place finish I would have loved to get the win but at the end of the day whether you finish first or second the wheels of the plane will touch down at Doha International Airport at the same time In the finals I feel like I ran probably the best set of hurdles I ve run indoors ever I was still coming up to set when the gun went off which caught me off guard a bit and caused my start to be even worse than it usually is I did a good job keeping my composure and made up a lot of ground and did what I had to do to make that team I was very impressed with my lead leg action I did not run my best race but I still had my fifth best performance indoors time wise I was joking with Brooks saying that my race would have been a hell of an outdoor one My coach has a philosophy which I have fully bought in to If you have a great race you re challenging the world record if you have a good race you win if you have a bad race you still make the podium / team and that 's what happened this time Race video I ve been out here in Albuquerque New Mexico for a couple of days now I ve done a few press conferences and interviews since I ve been out here I didn t have the opportunity to go and talk to the local kids with the Win With Integrity Program unfortunately That 's something I look forward to doing when I come to the meets in the States but I ll have another opportunity soon My mom and Harold made the six hour drive down from Denver and my boys Kelvin and Murph flew down too I 'm excited to be back at a National Championship event I miss both the indoor and outdoor championships in 2009 I love the competition that USA Nationals brings out of every competitor I have one race this afternoon and two on Sunday This event is our qualification for the World Indoor Championships in Doha Qatar that will be hosted March 12-14 The top two in each event make the team Me and Valeria will open up at 3 30 mountain time in heat one of three We ll be starting in lane five I ve found myself a breast cancer wristband with the word strength on it couldn t have found a better word I ll be racing in it This is a video that was played in the area on the news from the press conference I will update the blog after the first round hopefully everything goes as to plan As one of many athletes that is accessible through many social websites such as twitter Facebook and my blog I am never sure what type of messages I may receive Most are of the congratulatory type or words of encouragement you get a few that are negative and some that are indecent and lewd to say the least While checking my messages on Facebook I came across a message titled When You Run I open it up not really knowing what it may be about then I read Dear David thank you for been an inspiration for many young and old people like me :) I never met you and likely never will but I have a favor to ask you My life as i know it has changed since last month I was diagnosed with breast cancer and now as a sequel of my surgery I will not be able to be as active as I used to be I miss the outdoor the hiking the cycling but such is life One day when you run will you think of me so that for that one day I will be running too :) Thank you Valeria When I finished reading these few sentences I felt a wave of different emotions I felt sorry because Valeria is going through a life changing event I felt proud because she viewed me as being an inspiration that in turn changed my feeling of being sorry for her in to that of being in awe of her strength I felt surprised that she would think of me out of all of the people to ask to fulfill her very simple request Most of all I felt an elevated sense of responsibility That feeling came from me sitting back and realizing that we as public figures ( i e athletes entertainers etc ) no matter how minor or how major have an responsibility whether we like it or not to the masses When I go out and run a race which is very minor in the grand scheme of life the way that I present myself and act on and off the track somebody is watching me I may not be a big time NFL or NBA star or even a Usain Bolt in my sport but I realize that I have a lot of fans and am viewed as sort of an inspiration to them in one way or another and I do not want to jeopardize that I responded back to Valeria with this Thank you for viewing me as an inspiration to people I try to carry and handle myself in that position as well I have no problem with running for you I am competing at the USA Indoor Championships in New Mexico and I will definitely run for you there Keep in contact with me and I hope things turn around for you so that you will be able to get back to the active lifestyle you enjoyed So I will be doing just that My races that I am blessed to run out in Albuquerque New Mexico will be run for Ms Valeria Pagnon and I will find a pink breast cancer wrist band to wear in her honor I appreciate her for making me aware of the unique situation that I am in as well

should not Be a Pre Madonna Should not be late ask for days off breaks or a special jacket to show off to your friends Gchef703 linecook you should Be a Sponge Listen Learn and ask a million questions even if they are stupid questions ask em You re about to explode There 's too far too much blood and oxygen coursing through your veins and your eyes your pupils are so dialated that they would catch the attention of any police officer you came across You just finished your stage and it went so beautifully that you re too wound up to eat or drink or even talk about it This is one of those perfectly fleeting moments so you just sit there on the bus missing your stop so you can soak it all up You start Tuesday as the new fish cook Unless You blew it It seemed like your stage was going ok but right around the end of the first turn the sous told you that you could take off You considered protesting but instead you decided to change have a smoke and get a bite to eat Sitting down at the bar you order your food and a drink and sometime later the chef tells you that you re welcome back anytime but no job is discussed And you dont ask about one Your stage is over and you wasted it So how did this happen Prep You went into the restaurant between lunch and dinner service dressed appropriately resume and knives in hand For a week you ve been reading the menu on-line and bringing yourself up to speed on the background of the chef and the restaurant itself After your chat with the chef you let him know that you re ready to stage that evening if he would like He tells you to come back Friday instead On Friday you show up early smiling and introducing yourself to any staff that you come across You take your knives and a spoon out of your kit that you slimmed down a bit and settle in with any prep work that they ll give you--herb picking cutting bread citrus supremes You work quietly and cleanly with eyes and ears open so you dont miss a thing Unless You drop into the restaurant as you walk by and approach the chef who is expediting a fairly busy lunch service He doesn t have time to talk to you right now but tells you to come back that evening at 4 for a stage You tell him that you have tickets to a show but could you come in tomorrow He asks for a resume You dont have it with you When you do show up for your stage the chef asks you why you want to work in his restaurant what is it about this place this food that turns you on You stumble through some bullshit answers He smirks at you Unpacking your kit you pull out 6 knives a spatula tongs and a handful of spoons The sous steps in next to you Um What 's all that shit for Working through your prep you dont shut up--about your last job your opinions on how things should be done and who you think should win top chef No one really responds to you but you go on anyways Service The chef had told you that he needed a fish cook so this is the station that you stick with through prep line-up and into service During line up you politely ask if you can taste mise and as you taste dishes you take notes and try to memorize the station set-up Just before service you sweep the station and wipe down everything for the cook You ask the chef if he wants you anywhere else during service but he says no During service you pull plates and garnish but generally try to stay out of the way and observe Eventually the pace starts to build a bit and the cook catches your eye Alright We re going on 7 fish and 6 scallops We ll go together ok You take the scallop dish An hour later you re cooking all of the proteins on your own with the fish cook plating and garnishing for you When the sous asks how it 's all going for you you tell him you love it and want to close the station that night There will be no end of shift meal or drink for you Just a cold family meal a watery iced tea and a nod of approval from the brigade Unless You bounce around the kitchen getting all up in everyones shit but not really absorbing anything You taste without asking and more than once you criticize the food During one of your rants about how you used to do it at your last job the grill cook catches looks at you and growls Well that 's so fucking interesting Most of your evening is spent leaning against the ice machine and when you do step in you re so fucking slow wiping plates and garnishing that the sous knocks the chervil out of your hand and shouts JUST FUCKING SEND IT You cook zero orders and when you sit down to eat at the bar you order an expensive cocktail and dont tip You Fucking Blew It There is nothing like a stage in any other field of work Sure athletes have tryouts and actors have auditions A stage is both It lasts many hours is physically and mentally draining and everyone is already expecting you to fail before you even begin It 's the culinary equivalent of getting jumped into a gang You get one chance to get it right and being thrust into an unfamiliar borderline hostile environment guarantees that if you don t fail outright you are at very least probably going to make a stupid mistake And at the end of your stage it 's all of this pressure that makes succeeding all the more sweet To have cooked well and won over the cooks that let you into their home is a special thing It 's a re-affirming rite of passage and a fleeting feeling you only get to enjoy every once in a while Don t let your stage just pass on by notes that 's not bechamel holy shit I updated finally podcasts are coming back no really they are get some rest burrito stepping into an open grease trap means youll probably need new shoes that 's pasta water not a deep fryer fish amp farm seems like its becoming the new industry night off spot Quotes and Conversations Me to Gerardo Hey dude Tell

and for the record I ve been both quite enough thanks ) Benjamin_Parks linecook Slower but in control Chaos always creates more work ( cleaning fixing etc ) so quick chaos just produces more work faster cnewton9 linecook neither I always try to teach the kids that efficiency = speed vs accuracy fast but sloppy no good slow but perfect also no bueno Gchef703 linecook Slow Composed and in control FTW They can always gain speed later But sometimes speed is what you need good question stresscake linecook absolutely slow composed and in control Frenzy causes stressful miserable work environment Calmness is more productive over LT Jerry It 's looking like a slow Tuesday night and the cooks are coasting through their prep period all laughs and smiles There 's a lightness in the air and there are plans being made for days off A special family meal is on the stove and reggae plays on the dining room sound system Everyone is a quiet shadow of their usual kitchen self Except for Jerry Jerry has his headphones in playing Pantera so loudly that the cooks across the kitchen can hear it He bounces around nervously and just before service he jumps around and rolls his head like a boxer getting ready for a fight The kitchen will do 135 covers tonight Jerry will treat it like he just defeated the Roman army Denise The first thing Denise does when she comes in is crack a joke and say hello to everyone in the kitchen She ll breeze through prep with a smile on her face Then when things get busy on the second turn she will completely lose her shit There will be muttering under her breath mise slammed around and a constantly shaking head--like each order on her station is a personal insult to her mother Denise will stop calling back tickets completely until things escalate with her sous chef to the point of yelling and him kicking her off the station Nights like this will happen at least once a week Mark Mark is the first cook to show up for work every day He sets up his station meticulously There will not be a single detail missed and he will be almost invisible while he works There is a quiet dignity to him during this time Then when service starts he start acting like someone has taped a live grenade to his back There will be dips and dives and spins and some of the most violent movement you have ever seen The other cooks will be watching him out of the corners of their eyes At best he will end up exhausting the entire kitchen Jen Jen is like a warm blanket when she is next to you on the line you feel comforted happy She helps quietly cooks with dignity and maintains a level of composure far beyond her years of experience on the line She never raises her voice or flails or loses her temper Her movements are so fluid they appear slow--yet she 's always setting the pace for the other cooks Sitting with her eating family meal you ask her how she does it It 's just food right Why panic I 'm not doing open chest surgery or anything Composure It 's what separates good cooks from great ones It 's that quality that causes a guest to sit and watch transfixed by the grace and elegance of a dinner service It 's certainly not the most important quality for a cook to have but it 's something that kitchen lifers immediately recognize and come to respect in their peers When I started cooking my only goal was to be fast Aside from not working clean and generally spinning around in my head I probably looked like I was having a seizure Then I started to notice the other cooks around me that were better than me They were so collected so expressionless Did they just not care as much as me Did they just not take things as seriously Well no They just knew what they were doing As my sous chef at that time said to me :\ You don t want to look like a little bitch Time passed on and as I slowly came to find a comfortable place in my own skin my movements became more relaxed but my head didnt I still felt like I was one step away from flipping over my cutting board throwing my salt at the food runner and fist and elbowing my way out of the front door It would take lying to myself to cure it daily affirmations of You re on control you can cook you re a motherfucking handsome badass It sounds ridiculous It was And it worked Finding a way to be composed makes the other cooks look differently at you The crew will respect you your chef will be quietly impressed by you and your skills will improve You ll have more energy And you ll know what to tell Mark when he starts to lose it So how do you deal wih it Where do you find your place of balance How do you compose yourself when things get crazy Notes That G-Shock lasted a hard 10 years on my wrist I washed it by putting it through the dishwasher If the girl is more Ghost World than Mean Girls it 's probably a good thing When someone says they did a 's tint in a kitchen what the fuck does that mean In order to truly find balance in life I think a person really has to

Bloomingdale 's down the street Goose What the fuck is a Bloomingdale 's mer mer through my cup eating is fun thats a dumb shirt can head tattoo chef415 mischief a lot of data usage Here I sit at the end of 2009 and it feels like everything is different None of the details have changed I still live in San Francisco and I still cook at Nopa as a sous chef I 'm still writing this blog But when I look in the mirror or have a quiet moment to myself things feel different 2009 was a crazy year for me It was a good year for me In 2009 this blog seemed to find its place Through things that seem as trivial as a twitter account or a podcast I met people and made friendships that are deeply important to me Through countless emails I was able to connect with cooks from all over the world As everything seemed to be expanding and moving towards one big interpersonal disconnect the opposite ended up happening My world got smaller Then I turned 30 and came to realize that I needed to take life a little more seriously Soul searching introspection whatever I made some decisions and decided to stick to them Then I woke up one day and wow Things had changed 2010 is a little scary to think about A friend of mine said to me 2010 is the first year I haven t been excited about I had never thought about it like that and im not sure that 's my sentiment But it does feel like a giant scary beast that I have to tackle like im getting into the ring with a faceless terror In the following year im going to to be faced with figuring out whether im a better writer or a better cook There 's a chance that this blog could end in 2010 There isnt an infinite amount of topics for me to write about here Sometimes I feel like im just regurgitating the same old garbage A to that the fact that im going to be a father and want to open a restaurant this year and things start to get very cloudy and scary and im su enly very aware that nothing feels perfect or right but things just are It 's an amazing thing to be faced with the rest of your life I thought I knew what it would feel like and how I would deal with it I don t And I suspect that 's perfectly normal The thing is its not like anything is actually ending If anything things are just beginning After a year like 2009 where things were so good and changed so much I can only imagine what 's coming It 's possible that just being daunted about knowing that you have to make something for yourself is enough to leave you shaking but maybe its better to try to run through all of the insecurity and bullshit now before everyone is toasting at midnight So whats next What 's going to happen come July or next December Shit what 's going to happen next week Does the fear or uncertainty ever go away Do things ever start to feel right or perfect Or is it more important to just let things happen My Best Meals of 2009 Coi Flour amp Water every time 5 Points Ippudo Freeman 's Places I Ate At Often Flour amp Water Fish amp Farm

cooking is a lack of uderstanding It 's the easiest equation quality ingredients and a bit of care equal good results swedishmike linecook Taking good ingredients and making them taste bad It 's a cold Tuesday night and you re on a cook 's night out something your crew has looked forward to for days The plan is to hit a string of new restaurants eating as much as you can then topping it all off with bourbon and shameful behavior Rules are in place no eating anywhere that anyone has been before And no salads pizza or fancy renditions of mac n cheese Things started out well enough There were some tasty fried bits the required offal dish a polite terrine But the in the past hour things have taken a turn There was raw fish paired with fried cheese There was a risotto that was so rich and salty that your fish cook polished off the wine straight from the bottle And the lamb sa le was so over-techniqued that your best-of-friends hot apps cooks started screaming at each other over which part was the meat and which was the marrow-wrapped tongue and kidney croquette And it was cold The night ends with you and the grill guy sitting on a stoop having a smoke wondering what happened Maybe they were having an off night It 's only their second month Did you hear the chef de cuisine came from Mugaritz Maybe they re just settling Remember that case of nasty chicken bones we got last Wednesday Maybe there 's an epedemic of bad stocks sweeping the city I saw that dude Damien in their kitchen I hate that guy Bad food stays with you It haunts you You feel violated--your precious time and money wasted It 's made even worse when friends or expectations are involved And it 's something that you are more likely to experience as the craft of cooking expands and evolves But why Is it as simple as a cook that doesn t care or that isn t truly passionate about their craft Of course But I think in most cases it 's something else completely Bad cooking happens when things fall out of balance Temperature Tastes Textures A cook 's focus A cook 's attitude Have you ever eaten a meal with so much technique that the kitchen forgot about the actual taste Have you ever had a meal so rustic you were left wondering if the kitchen was just slopping it out Remember that night on the line where you were so focused on your meat temps that your veg was constantly scorched Remember that night on the line when you were having so much fun that you kept forgetting to a that garnish you worked on for an hour Balance is essential to good cooking--on every level and in every position It 's the most difficult thing to achieve--and when it 's happening it 's almost invisible A cook 's personality in general is not balanced A group of people given to such highs and lows and dedicated only to pleasure and sensuality where do you find balance in that As cooks comes to know themselves their awareness of balance slowly starts to reveal itself They can feel the push and pull of their own emotions Their heart swells and almost bursts when things are good and shatters to pieces when things are bad--but they find a way to stay anchored in the mi le head down with only a deep breath as evidence that they re feeling anything at all Coercing their mind into this mental mi le ground starts to translate into the pan then onto the plate The quiet balance in the cooks mind tells them when to hold back and when to push--be it with seasoning speed or technique It 's a mental high wire act that 's exhausting with far greater consequences If you fall off the wire you die Big deal If you cook bad food you ve lost guests and shamed your kitchen You actually have to live with that Some cooks never find balance--and that 's ok with them They produce food that they re happy with--and that the vast majority of diners would be happy to eat But if the goal is to get better to progress to contribute then isn t it important to find a sustainable method for mentally and physically producing your craft If the goal is to be the best and create great food then isn t balance the most important ingredient notes sometimes indie music is indie because it completely sucks something I did not

The newest State of the Birds report is out and the news is not good The 2010 Report concludes that accelerated climate change continues to alter the natural world as we know it diminishing the quality of our environment and leaving a lasting impact on many bird species The new report was released this week by United States Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar Just as they did in 1962 when Rachel Carson published Silent Spring our migratory birds are sending us a message about the health of our planet Salazar said That is why--for the first time ever--the Department of the Interior has deployed a coordinated strategy to plan for and respond to the impacts of climate change on the resources we manage Key findings from the State of the Birds climate change report include Oceanic birds are among the most vulnerable species because they don t raise many young each year they face challenges from a rapidly changing marine ecosystem and they nest on islands that may be flooded as sea levels rise All 67 oceanic bird species such as petrels and albatrosses are among the most vulnerable birds on Earth to climate change Hawaiian birds such as endangered species Puaiohi and Akiap l au already face multiple threats and are increasingly challenged by mosquito-borne diseases and invasive species as climate change alters their native habitats Birds in coastal arctic / alpine and grassland habitats as well as those on Caribbean and other Pacific islands show intermediate levels of vulnerability most birds in aridlands wetlands and forests show relatively low vulnerability to climate change For bird species that are already of conservation concern such as the golden-cheeked warbler whooping crane and spectacled eider the a ed vulnerability to climate change may hasten declines or prevent recovery The report identified common bird species such as the American oystercatcher common nighthawk and northern pintail that are likely to become species of conservation concern as a result of climate change The report is a collaborative effort as part of the U S North American Bird Conservation Initiative between federal and state wildlife agencies and scientific and conservation organizations including partners from the American Bird Conservancy Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies Cornell Lab of Ornithology Klamath Bird Observatory National Audubon Society

I promise I am not complaining Really I am not although it may sound like I am In doing battle with pirates everywhere I have recently been unable to avoid the question WHERE ARE ALL THE NINJAS I understand that we are difficult to pick out of a croud and that we sorta specialize in the whole 's olitary assassin thing If someone asked me hey koalaMan I am starting a ninja-union do you want to join I would be like no way man That 's totally lame But really you think that with my precision my speed and my general rage I would sense a ninja from time to time but the radar is pretty much flatlined these days which is not cool at all Don t get me wrong I am not scared of pirates They are totally wusses and ten pirates wouldn t stand a chance against even a modestly-adept ninja (s ay one that has a weakness for the biscuits or something ) However we do need to get down out of the tree unsheath our shurikens and our laser guns and get George Washington on their Martin Van Buren asses Like the 8th president of the United States pirates may be dense hairy wusses but also like ole kinderhook pirates stick together and help their own to get ahead Furthermore they have recently been demonstrating a disturbing aptitude for improving their image through various media like music and cinema Every day it seems like I see some person who seems okay at first but then is like yeah I love pirates They are really cool Why I think you know and so I ll spare you the tirade But seriously ninjas-- time is short Remember especially while you Yanks are giving thanks today that a real ultimate holiday is coming up and then it will be time to show thanks Flip out on a pirate Eat a bagel ( or a muffin ) while wailin on a scone-eater Do something anything just to show that we re out there We gotta start biting back or we ll be drinkin rum and reelin like vermin before you know it Okay so obviously I had better apologize for not having gotten a post up for a year To be honest I was getting a bit too comfortable up in the tree It seemed that we ninjas had the whole pirate problem under control As if their insipid music weren t enough their complete and utter aversion to electric guitars was a sure sign of bad taste Yeah life seemed good but only because I had my head stuck up in my err tree The other day while I was tryin to rub the sleep and the blood from my most recent victim from my eyes I heard one of my wee ones screamin arrrrrrrrrr What What is this I cannot be Little one I aske dwhat was that Surely she was just practicing her frisbee-folding techniques or something I thought but again she yelle darrrrrrrrr To which I responded What is that The next thing I heard had me looking for a laser guided scone-coated frisbee of death I 'm a pirate da y arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr Okay so it 's like that now Can t fight me wuss-to-marsupial eh Have to go after the Joey 's huh Well now it 's on You know that look that women tend to get when you tell them that men are better drivers or that barristas get when you tell them their espresso is almost as good as Starbucks Well that 's me now I am that barrista and I am that women Err or not But you get my point I am totally pissed and pirates are going to get hurt And not just by me either No I am calling up the real ultimate ninja George Freakin Washington Yeah and we re going to put a hurt down on anyone who gets in our way Pain is coming and it 's coming hard and fast By flipping out and wasting pirates all over the world you can be sure we are going to save children but not save pirate children Oh yes make no mistake the world 's scurvy rate 's are goin down for sure Oh and in case you re wondering the Joey 's are all fine now I ll tell that story one day but for now I cannot make merriment until pirate faces are hurt I 'm here I would like to start by apologizing for not posting EVER especially the post about the Thomas Kincade edition Lincoln Navigator Im sure it would have been funny I am hoping I will be writhing more We just moved stuff into our apartment on Tuesday so we have been settling in but it was not long before we saw some miniature Jello molded to the likeness of San Francisco Were we all made for a purpose Sure And what on Earth are we here for Community of course If I wanted to I could explain to you the five pillars that support both of these claims However I would instead like to take a moment to introduce something else my purpose driven Louisville Slugger This thing is long slim and can apply a total beat-down to any pirate dog old lady or wannabe gangsta to which I may apply it Unlike Pant 's intellect it cannot be stopped Seriously this thing is bona fide Like all important issues that you face in life this bat 's significance can be characterized by 5 central points that is it ROCKS 1 ) R it Represents true ultimate power 2 ) O it Opens a can of whoop ass on those who deserve it 3 ) C it is Cool and sweet and awesome and makes me want to crap myself 4 ) K it Kills anyone to whom it is applied 5 )S: it is Stealth so that by the time it has struck you are like WOW I am totally dead See my bat ROCKS But if one person 's bat rocks then anyone can ignore that But what if you that 's right you were to apply these simple principals to your life Then there would be two bats that rock That 's two purpose driven bats imagine Now let 's keep this going Lets say we had the whole of Chucktown totin purpose driven bats Imagine We would all be like I am totally pissed I wanna kill kill kill and so all the pirates would be crapping themselves like Oh my god We are so totally dead Well you get the idea The nation the whole world even united under this simple ROCKS principal then we would all be totally sweet and all the pirates would be all beat up and bloody and not even dead but like aw man this totally hurts I would kill myself but I am not even cool enough for that And what a great sight that would be But it all starts with you And with me I know that you probably have all sorts of complicated questions but I assure you that it is really simple Just go and do Be purpose driven Don t let questions and doubt get the better of you If we all just go out and do it then we cannot be stopped A thought occurred to me while stalking a crepe vendor the other day Whereas I don t wear any clothing I do notice the clothing of those around me After all humans all look alike to me and so while instructing younger pastries I 'm all like No kill the one in the green shirt What I ve noticed is this while so-called hipsters have been wearing vintage clothing for years now all of the major clothing chains are selling faux vintage 's hirts I 'm talking like Abercrombie and Fitch 1972 or Old Navy hopscotch team and shit like that It 's kinda lame but I am looking forward in fifteen years time to being able to go to the Salvation Army and purchasing a shirt that is both real vintage and fake vintage at the same time I ve been visiting the Violent Dismemberment Happy Bakery and Deli where I was born this week and I ll tell you I wasn t as disrespectful or obnoxious as the confections you see nowadays First of all what ever happened to just a regular tasty non-hugemongous un-nasty muffin VDHB and D is now full of some freakin obese muffins Just because you are a source of simple carbohydrates that 's no excuse for carbo-loading all the time you disgusting bran-piggies Also muffins should not smell like ham Another thing I 'm not a racist but the music these doughnuts are listening to these days really get my filling ( Oh I 'm sorry that 's the REAL spelling not your hip doughnut vernacular ) I 'm just saying that the bakers really need to put their feet down these delicious baked goods are fresh out of the oven and don t know what 's up they need guidance Good thing they have an older brother to show them how to throw down Me and some of the ki ies went on a field trip to assassinate some prominent squirrels in the area ( I hate me some fuckin squirrels ) I brought the doughnuts bearclaws muffins and croissants but not the bagels as they are a bunch of chewy momma 's boys We staged a daring midnight raid on a major squirrel stronghold i e a big tree We fought long fought hard and occasionally fought well By morning the crack-a icted mammals lay defeated and several pigeons too Only half of my squad was killed by the squirrels pigeons and morning rush-hour traffic If that price seems steep bear in mind we come in pans of twelve OK so one thing is certain no one wants to be the guy posting after the mountain that is Cap n Romeo the Lusty and Juliet-san So consider this the follow-on post It was going to be a disappointment no matter what so no loss Now that it 's out of the way maybe we can move on with our mortal lives

Brainstorm and Timeline Step 2 - Communication Tips - Resources for Promotion This post originally appeared on http // surveihiphop blogspot com Communication is not really a 's tep but it is one of the most important things In the Hip Hop Hunger event it was my fault that for the longest time I didn t know that my school 's portable stage wasn t stable enough for rapping and dancing so I found that out with only a week before the event will happen As I write this ( I 'm writing this on Friday Feb 22 ) I 'm wondering if someone will be able to donate a portable stage on Wednesday Other than this things have ran smoothly because of early communication If this is your first event you re planning you should probably talk with some people you know who have event experience and ask them if they can give you advice My friends who are in a rock band called Supersonia have had many successful events about two per year from sophomore year to senior year Before I planned the Hip Hop Hunger Event I sat down with one of them at a coffee shop and took notes about how to plan an event So if you know someone at your school who 's done something remotely similar to what you are planning then talk with them Forms of Communication The type of communication you have with people will depend on your event and your goals In the Hip Hop Hunger event it was my goal to get some big name acts at it and I used email with them It doesn t hurt to ask especially if it 's for charity It doesn t hurt to have at least that small connection with someone in which you invited them to come but they couldn t make it If the event is for-profit ( as opposed to for-charity ) you will have to figure out your budget because then it is likely you would pay the artists ( If the event is not some sort of fundraiser or charity event and you want to do it at school you might have to pay the school or venue ) I also contacted people at my school and when I talked to them I just spoke and exchanged phone numbers Also it 's good to figure out what is the best way of communication for the artist / event-crew-person If you re using email and you have their phone number and it takes awhile for them to respond then try calling Also if you get stuck in a game of phone tag or if the other person prefers email then email is a good choice The best way of course is to speak face-to-face and if that 's an option it 's good to do it at least twice before the event Tone and Attitude Here is a good article about writing effective emails CD Baby on Writing Good Emails In whatever way you contact someone your attitude should be that you are requesting and not forcing anything on someone Also if someone agrees to help you even if it 's their job you should approach them with the attitude that they are doing something extra for you Your heart should be thankful and if you are they will remember that Other posts in this series Introduction to Series Step 1 - Brainstorm and Timeline Step 2 - Communication Tips - Resources for Promotion This post originally appeared on http // surveihiphop blogspot com Hey Everyone I am introducing a blog post series about planning events and concerts When I was planning the Hip Hop Hunger event I looked online for something about planning events and I couldn t find anything But I talked with friends and people I knew who had more experience and I learned a lot While I am no expert I think I can share some helpful information that is worth considering Keep in mind that you should probably take the advice of someone wiser than me but hopefully this will get you started To get you started here is step 1 when I make a new post in this series I will bump this post up and write a phrase that summarizes the new post Other posts in this series Introduction to Series Step 1 - Brainstorm and Timeline Step 2 - Communication Tips - Resources for Promotion This post originally appeared on http // surveihiphop blogspot com The first question to be answered in event planning is What will this event be and what is it for So start broad and think of all the ideas you can figure out where you re going with it and go from there Someone emailed me with a question about planning events and this is how I responded The first step is to brainstorm and write down every idea you can think of The ideas can be as out-of-the-box as you want because having something unique helps Then I d say to go over your and your friends ideas if you re doing this with a group and pick something Then after you figure out what it is exactly you want to do you should talk with the activities coordinator at your school or an equivalent key person if it 's not at school with a few event dates in mind and find out if any of them will work Once you have the event day chosen you will want to make a timeline stating when you want to contact all the artists / performers and important elements of the show such as sound lights and a stage Earlier is better of course and it 's good to plot this out For the Hip Hop Hunger event I started contacting artists around November of 2007 even though the concert wasn t until February 08 If the event is something you re passionate about that will make it better it has to be something you ll be willing to go outside of your comfort zone for Once you go outside your comfort zone enough times you ll forget it was there and that will make things easier in the future Other posts in this series Introduction to Series Step 1 - Brainstorm and Timeline Step 2 - Communication Tips - Resources for Promotion This post originally appeared on http // surveihiphop blogspot com As an artist and a student keeping my priorities straight is important So any free time in which I 'm not doing rapping which won t be much time will be the time that I update the blog Obviously I love blogging but it wouldn t make sense to spend more time blogging than making music right The future of this blog Someone made a very good point that I should upload some of my music on the site or at least link to a site that does have some of my music I haven t been in a recording studio yet but I hope to sometime in March and then I will have some music to put online But that might come after the initial wave of attention Maybe someone will record a video from the Hip Hop Hunger event Another thing I might do is a blog post series on how to have a successful event and what goes into that Hip Hop Hunger is the first event I ve ever planned and I learned a lot that I think I could share with people When I was planning the event I looked for things online and I didn t come across much on event planning so I talked with people and that was very helpful A last thing might be to publish some some short stories if I have time but don t hold your breath that 's at the bottom of my to-do list Thanks for reading This post originally appeared on http // surveihiphop blogspot com I ve been blogging off and on for about 3 years and this was a surprise that I don t think you can prepare for When I first saw that my site was a blog of note I didn t know how to react because I only created the Hip Hop Hunger website to promote a single event I guess that shows how much a difference site design can make In a semi-panic I made a post explaining exactly what the site was and who I am and then thanks to peoples suggestions I put a link in the upper-right of the blog so that people could donate to the charity WorldVision because I realized that a lot of people seeing the site would not be able to come to the event Also I think I did not react the best way I could have but being a blogger and an artist you could say that I wanted to connect with some people and a ress them and talk about myself which doesn t really fit for the Hip Hop Hunger website which is not supposed to be a blog but a website for an event that is about something much bigger than me So I wanted to a something to the top of the welcome message to put the focus of that site back where it should be which is that this event is for charity specifically for hunger in Africa Someone brought up some good points about food aid on the site at The Cause section You can follow the conversation there I tried to answer questions the best I could This post originally appeared on http // surveihiphop blogspot com I know it sounds like some sort of nerdy liscense-plate frame but it 's true The funny part is that it isn t even really a blog What I did was I hacked the blogger format to create a webpage for my Hip Hop event known as Hip Hop Hunger I put a lot into the design of that site but not a lot of writing and this blog however is the opposite a lot of writing and not a lot of design yet But it 's the writing that really counts As an artist and blogger I am thankful for this publicity but it 's too bad I don t have any music samples of my rapping for y all to listen to Well I ll give what I can and that is my excitement I 'm excited about my future as a rapper and I am definitely a beginner but I 'm learning and taking it a step at a time Each time I reach a milestone I 'm going to document it here for me to look back on and if that peaks anyone 's interest well I hope somehow God could use these words on a screen two feet in front of you to affect us positively This post originally appeared on http // surveihiphop blogspot com 
I turned the water on as hot as I could stand it Steam quickly filled the room and choked out the air as I stepped naked into the shower (T he next part is embarrassing and humiliating to admit ) Facing the water I closed my eyes I took a deep breath and held it as I interlocked my fingers tightly behind my head and leaned forward into the stream pouring down Titling my head toward the ground I allowed the water to wash over my neck and back hoping to release the built-up tension in my shoulders and constriction looming deep within my chest Then a giant exhale With my forehead now resting against the shower wall and my forearms squeezing the blood surrounding my temples I remembered to relax To stop trying to hold on to it To let it flow through me like rain And it did And as a result I kind of lost it I started to cry - a very rare occurrence for me Although I can t be sure if they were tears or just water droplets from the showerhead falling to my feet Either way it doesn t matter and neither does this confession This story has nothing to do with blogging Although it does help explain some of the recent events happening in my life which have led to a few decisions including this one Today marks my 999th post here on The Rest Is Still Unwritten It also marks the day I say goodbye to blogging I ve always said that the day blogging ceases to be fun for me is the day I step away That day has come So I 'm stepping back ( backspacing ) from writing I ve enjoyed the 5 + year journey but I no longer feel inspired to write Lots of things still left to say just no energy or will to say them What was once a creative outlet that I ve describe as therapeutic now feels excruciatingly painful for me to continue The joy just simply isn t there and neither are the words It should go without saying this makes me incredibly sad This isn t an impulse decision It 's something I ve been mulling over for some time now evidence of this Tweet (p ictured above ) from last week I considered deleting the entire blog and not saying a word as to why but I felt that wouldn t be fair to you the reader Plus I didn t want to deal with answering countless questions of what happened people thinking it was just a system glitch Instead I 'm allowing my little corner of the web to stand as is You re welcome to browse through the rather extensive Archive But I can t say when if ever I ll return My realization is one that is not umm happy In the past I ve seen writing as a gift For it has given me the ability to express the things in my everyday life that are often too difficult for me to verbalize So I put pen to paper in my coveted Moleskine or I blog about it here I write it all out and I write through it This time it 's different This time I can t write about it and what 's even more difficult is that I ve realized I have no one to even talk about it with to help me cope I don t have that type of relationship with any of my bu ies or even with anyone in my family It 's like emotional paralysis where feeling too much is leaving me numb So instead I 'm choosing to share nothing I 'm keeping quiet and keeping to myself And if the day comes that I feel the urge to write here again there won t be some lame teaser Tweet to build up online anticipation or a dramatic comeback post I ll simply slide in just as quietly and unannounced as I slid out Because in the end I want to live by my motto - Write Like No One Is Reading xoxo David PS (P lease don t e-mail me wanting to su enly be my friend and offer your ear While I appreciate the kind gesture and I 'm sure you mean well this letter is not my plea for help It 's more or less a PSA as to what is happening on my blog Also I 'm sorry if this news leaves anyone feeling disappointed But understand that life happens And when it does we cope the best way we know how Perhaps this will only be a short hiatus So keep me in your reader keep me linked and check back soon Again my apologies ) ---NOTE--- The follow-up from 1 /21/10 - Release After the Melissa Blake fiasco I swore I would never guest post for anyone ever again And I didn t until my friend Elisa Doucette from OpheliasWebb com convinced me otherwise Since February is dubbed the month of love Elisa put together a great blog series project all about love She selected 28 bloggers to guest post on the topic and has published their words throughout the entire month of February 1 Blog 1 Topic 1 Month 28 Days 28 Guest Bloggers Although a lie I like to pretend she saved the best for last by making me the final guest blogger in the series with this post below Clarity I want you to get swept away out there I want you to levitate I want you to sing with rapture and dance like a dervish Be deliriously happy or at least leave yourself open to be I know it 's a cornball thing But love is passion obsession someone you can t live without I say fall head over heels Find someone you can love like crazy and who will love you the same way back How do you find him Well you forget your head and you listen to your heart And I 'm not hearing any heart Cause the truth is honey there 's no sense living your life without this To make the journey and not fall deeply in love well you haven t lived a life at all But you have to try cause if you haven t tried you haven t lived - Anthony Hopkins role as Bill Parrish in the movie Meet Joe Black heart to heart father / daughter talk Love is a crazy dizzy thing Sometimes it 's all so beautiful I can hardly stand it I want to capture it So I take a photograph To make time stand still I freeze the moment for all eternity and hang that memory on a wall But then that doesn t seem like enough The photograph allows me to recall that exact same vision I once had but it doesn t give me the movement The way that one strand of hair kept blowing across her face attempting to unite with her bottom lip Or the way the early morning sunlight pardoned the rain reflecting and dancing across the small of her back from the dusty windowpane read the rest of my Guest Post here Also be sure to check out the other bloggers (s ome really talented writers included ) who participated in the series Elisa 's All You Need Is Love blog series project will definitely get you thinking and questioning love and your own life If a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it does it make a sound Is is a philosophical ri le that raises questions regarding observation and knowledge of reality That theory is called 's ubjective idealism and refers to a time in which objects cease to exist once there is nobody around to perceive them However one may argue that if a tree falls in the forest and no one hears it did it really fall Meaning - the objects of sense exist only when they are perceived The common sense answer is yes It obviously makes a sound since we know that a tree falling makes noise regardless of whether anyone is around or not The metaphysical answer is no The tree does not make a sound if no one is there to witness it falling And indeed the act of making a sound isn t even a quandary all that matters is that the tree in fact ceases to exist if no one is there to witness it The production of sound requires 3 things a source a medium and a receiver But what about happiness It also needs the same 3 elements So is happiness only real when shared There is the possibility of unperceived existence That something can exist without being perceived If no one is around to see hear or feel your happiness does it not exist Does happiness need a witness Someone to validate it Someone to share in it to make it real For years I didn t realize how unhappy I was until I was happy And you never realize how happy you were until that happiness disappears from your life Happiness is not tangible but yet it feels very fragile in our hands Hold too tightly and you smother it Hold too carelessly and you lose it Unclasp your hands and you share it Open your heart and you receive it I believe happiness can exist alone in ourselves but I feel it is far more satisfying when shared In an ideal world we would share a piece of happiness with someone everyday Touch them in some way to let them know their existence matters However life is anything but ideal It is often difficult to prove to someone how happy they make you Whether that happiness is mutually shared or not the only thing concrete about the emotion is that YOU know it to exist I know it exists because I can feel it like 10-million fireflies filling my chest cavity I may not always be able to explain it or even prove it But trust me it exists and it 's incredibly real So what do you think True or false Is happiness only real when shared There is a reason the young are naive It protects us from the harsh truths and cold realities of a life we are not yet ready to see As children we aren t prepared to deal with the heartbreak and confusion that later reveals itself with age and wisdom Like every kid I looked up to my father I idolized him Worshiped him He was my Superman A man that could do no wrong A man that was always right A man that knew best And a man that was in fact human It often takes years before we see our parents for who they really are Not these fictitious superheroes we have built-up in our mind and heart but rather people People that make mistakes It was only a year after I graduated college that I learned that painful lesson That the man I had admired and role modeled myself after for 20 + years of my life had been telling me embellished truths While the phrase embellished truth 's ounds more pleasing to the ear than the word lie both are essentially the same To embellish is to enhance ( a statement or narrative ) with fictitious a itions to beautify it Simply put it 's a fancy lie If you have ever seen the movie Resurrecting The Champ you ll be familiar with parts of what I 'm about to say A writer like a boxer must stand alone Having your words published like entering a ring puts your talents on display And there 's nowhere to hide I don t intend to write a story about myself or my father Or about love Or the lies that can sometimes come from love We live in that fear I will tell you this about the man I call Dad He is against all reason my friend And he is also a liar But was that because he was trying to make himself better than who he was Or was it because the one force more powerful than a son wanting the admiration of his father is the father wanting the admiration of his son Sometimes we need the help of our imagination to achieve that status For it is no easy task being the strongest wisest and most beloved man in all the land And what is sa er is that moment when our children discover that we are not the illusory superman we ve created but rather as Herman Melville once wrote 'm en drained of valor The lies that come from love can devastate as much as those that come from malice Dad 's legacy I suppose is the inspiration for truth A beauty that lets our children admire us unconditionally as I love my father Today is my BFF 's 3rd birthday Yes my BFF is a dog Or at least to you he 's a dog To me he is sooo much more than I can even put into words Actually I can attempt to put it into words and I very much wanted to do just that today in celebration of his birthday However time is of the essence And because I would rather spend more time playing WITH him on his birthday than blogging ABOUT him I 'm going to keep this post short and sweet I 'm re-posting the poem I posted on his 1st birthday Then I 'm cutting out of work early taking him on a shopping spree at Petsmart to the dog park to play with his friends then home to do a little backyard sle ing / snowboarding ( his favorite ) and finally inside by the fire to warm up couch cu ling Go ahead and laugh Think I 'm crazy or think I 'm joking I 'm neither This is how I want to spend my Friday night Like a fine aged wine our love only gets better with time And there 's no one else I rather spend my days with Happy birthday to my favorite chunk of meat I love you Diesel A Boy And His Dog by Edgar Guest A boy and his dog make a glorious pair No better friendship is found anywhere For they talk and they walk and they run and they play And they have their deep secrets for many a day And that boy has a comrade who thinks and who feels Who walks down the road with a dog at his heels He may go where he will and his dog will be there May revel in mud and his dog will not care Faithful he ll stay for the slightest command And bark with delight at the touch of his hand Oh he owns a treasure which nobody steals Who walks down the road with a dog at his heels No other can lure him away from his side He 's proof against riches and station and pride Fine dress does not charm him and flattery 's breath Is lost on the dog for he 's faithful to death He sees the great soul which the body conceals Oh it 's great to be young with a dog at your heels ---NOTE--- 12 /7/05 - Define Sexy ( Recommended reading before you start the post below ) Everyone has a different definition of sexy Five years ago on my blog I attempted to define what the word 's exy 'm eant to me However I left out one keyword - independent At the time I was working under a female boss and despite the fact she was in her mid-40s and old enough to be my Mother I felt this very strong attraction to her She was attractive but her physical appearance is not what drew me to her It was a quality she possessed the type of lifestyle she lived She was an independent woman and it was so incredibly sexy to me The best thing about being single and dating is that through the years you discover exactly what it is that you really want or in my case what I didn t want I 'm not a MILF hunter or cougar lover I date girls my own age However I ve come to realize that the vast majority of girls I had dated and had relationships with have not been independent women Perhaps that is partially why none of those relationships worked out Or perhaps getting a taste of what a relationship with an independent woman is really like is all that I needed to wet my appetite and have me craving my very own Miss Independent It 's a well known fact that most guys are intimidated by powerful women They simply can t handle it For some a woman that is fully capable of taking care of herself and doesn t need a man in her life is a giant blow to the male ego It takes a very confident man to be with an independent woman He has to be secure with who he is and rarely doubt his ability to please her He must understand that although he may not be needed in her life he is wanted in her life I love independent women but I would be lying if I said moments of doubt and bits of insecurity don t creep into my head when it comes to being with a Miss Independent There are so many 20-somethings ( both guys and girls ) out there that don t have a clue what they are doing They are in dept up to their eyeballs but instead of working to pay off that debt they decide to just travel the world and live this carefree I 'm going to find myself lifestyle Sure that modern day hippie / slacker shit sounds all poetic and fun but it 's not long before reality comes along to slap them in the face waking them from their dreamy state They don t know what they want to be when they grow up despite the fact they ve been a grownup for years They teeter back and forth about going to school or going back to school They really haven t given much thought to the future or set any long term goals Most haven t even set short term goals So they drift aimlessly from one location to the next one job to the next and one relationship to the next And when it comes to love their track record consists of binge drinking and hooking up rather than any actual dating or a real relationship past This is why an independent woman is sooo refreshing I want a 20-something girl that has direction in her life and not only knows what she wants but is already well on that path to achieving it She knows who she is where she 's been and where she is going And she wears 800 stilettos during every step of the way not to flaunt her success but because she 's worth it She has earned it She is strong She is sexy She is Miss Independent And yes although a rare breed she does exist Miss Independent by Ne-Yo Ooh it 's something about just something about the way she move I can t figure it out There 's something about her Said ooh it 's something about kinda woman that want you but don t need you Hey I can t figure it out There 's something about her Cause she walk like a boss talk like a boss Manicured nails to set the pedicure off She 's fly effortlessly And she move like a boss do what a boss do She got me thinking about getting involved That 's the kinda girl I need ( Chorus ) She got her own thing that 's why I love her Miss Independent won t you come and spend a little time She got her own thing that 's why I love her Miss Independent ooh the way we shine Miss Independent yeah Ooh there 's something about kinda woman that can do for herself I look at her and it makes me proud There 's something about her There 's something oh so sexy about kinda woman that don t even need my help She said she got it she got it No doubt there 's something about her Cause she work like a boss play like a boss Car and a crib she bout to pay em both off And her bills are paid on time She made for a boss only a boss Anything less she telling them to get lost That 's the girl that 's on my mind ( Repeat Chorus ) Mmm her favorite thing to say don t worry I got it Mmm and everything she got best believe she bought it Mmm she going steal my heart ain t no doubt about it Girl you re everything I need Said you re everything I need ( Repeat Chorus ) Miss Independent That 's why I love her I never understood people who are into celebrity gossip Who is crushing on who Whose marriage is on the rocks Or who is secretly tying the knot I mean really who cares It 's TMI I subscribe to the belief that what happens behind closed doors is no one 's damn business uh that 's why the door is closed This is exactly why I rarely ask any of my bu ies who they are dating It 's not uncaring of me it 's respectful Of course I will go into 's lumber party mode with female friends so they can get all girly giggly and gi y gushing over some boy I am happy for them and they are welcome to share their excitement with me Although for the most part other people 's romantic / sexual interests don t interest me We live in a world of information overload these days So I 'm perfectly happy and content NOT knowing who is banging who In fact I prefer it that way Besides what purpose does that information serve me or anyone else for that matter It would only satisfy the nosey Don t be nosey Don t Ask Don t Tell (D ADT ) is the common term for the policy stopping openly gay lesbian and bisexual individuals from serving in the United States military This federal law is in place because they claim it would create an unacceptable risk to the high standards of morale good order discipline and unit cohesion that are the essence of military capability Therefore the act prohibits any homosexual or bisexual person from disclosing his or her sexual orientation or from speaking about any homosexual relationships while serving in the United States armed forces My thoughts on the topic surrounding ANYONE S personal relationship business regardless if the person is gay or straight Don t Ask Don t Tell Don t Care And if it slips out still I don t care It doesn t affect my life in the least and it doesn t make me think any more or less about you as a person It is what it is I don t care if you re gay I don t care if you re straight I don t care if you re married divorced single or have 2 5 kids I don t care if you re black I don t care if you re white I don t care who you slept with how many people you slept with or how long it 's been since you slept with anyone All I care about is if you can do your job If you can cover my back when bullets and bombs fly Can you do that Will you do that If you answered yes to both questions then what 's the problem here Why not let gays in the military Who you are attracted to shouldn t make you less of a solider Just like being attracted to big bottomed brunettes instead of big breasted blondes wouldn t make you any less of a solider either We just have different tastes that 's all It should be noted that there are already gay people in our military but they are in there because they ve kept their sexual preferences hush-hush But when did who you are attracted to have anything to do with the capabilities of performing your job A problem is often complicated but the solution is often simple What 's difficult is the follow through And in this case getting the rest of the country to see it as such The fact is this - no one is condoning giant orgies to facilitate in the Army Barracks And regardless of what your occupation is very few employers are accepting of romantic / sexual relationships taking place at work So I think we could all understand and completely accept a rule / law stating that any type of romantic / sexual relationship is forbi en to form in our U S military But to deny someone the opportunity to serve our country simply because they like boys instead of girls seems unbelievable to me What really irritates me is many of the homophobes who are complaining about having gays in the military saying they aren t man enough to serve lack the balls to serve themselves I hate to quote a Hollywood scripted movie when trying to relate to a real world issue but I have to say that Jack Nicholson as Col Jessep in A Few Good Men 's ummed this up best when he declared I have neither the time nor the inclination to explain myself to a man who rises and sleeps under the blanket of the freedom I provide and then questions the manner in which I provide it I would rather you just said thank you and went on your way Otherwise I suggest you pick up a weapon and stand a post Either way I don t give a damn what you think you are entitled to ---NOTE--- Related post of interest 11 /5/08 - One Giant Leap Forward And One Giant Leap Backwards When this year 's Super Bowl matchup was announced Saints vs Colts I renamed it to the Super Snooze I felt it would lack that action packed hard-nosed 60 minutes of thrilling NFL football I was accustom to watching I 'm happy to report that I was wrong The game was actually competitive and pretty exciting And the commercials weren t too shabby either or at least that was my personal opinion when I went into work on Monday morning I figured there would be Peyton Manning fans whining but what I didn t expect were women to be shouting sexism Sexism really I 'm sorry the ads are only seen as sexist if you twist the humor out of them So lighten up They aren t sexist They are geared toward men So if you re not a man there is a good chance you wouldn t enjoy something geared to men Correct That 's why women subscribe to Cosmo and not Maxim So what makes you think the Super Bowl should be the exception to that rule I wouldn t tune into the Oxygen channel or the Lifetime Movie Network and expect the commercials there to be geared toward me Let me make something clear to everyone Football just like any other televised event / show has a target audience The NFL marketing demographic is aimed at males ages 18-34 That is their target audience who is tuning into the games So it 's only smart business for advertisers to create commercials that appeal to the vast majority of NFL fans males ages 18-34 Needless to say young adult males are into beer tits technology cars and potty humor This is why when you watch football and especially the Super Bowl you see ads for Bud big breasted GoDa y com girls and muscle cars Sexist No Smart The cost for a 30-second commercial during this year 's Super Bowl was 2 6 million Do you really think any company would waste that kind of cash on a commercial that doesn t grab the attention of males ages 18-34 their target audience If you were selling Tampax tampons you would air your ad during Oprah If you were selling Viagra you would air your ad during re-runs of Murder She Wrote And if you were selling Zhu-Zhu Pets you would air your ad during Dora The Explorer Women you re more than welcome to watch the game with men Although you will never see any man scream SEXIST if a woman makes a remark about how tight the QB 's butt looks or how you live in Florida but you re rooting for the NY Jet 's simply because Mark Sanchez is cute Football is a game filled with testosterone blood and sweat Men behaving like beasts Wrestling and roughing each other up in a battle of strength and strategy So don t be surprised ( or complain ) that watching football makes me want to eat meat drink beer and burp It brings out the animal in us Personally I think it 's healthy to hang with the boys and yell FUCK during bad ref calls I also think it 's perfectly normal for me to drool over two hot chicks in lingerie making out And it 's perfectly normal that I want to jump up and cheer when I see a man taking a stand for himself instead of being emasculated by an over controlling woman If that makes me a caveman or a sexist pig so be it FloTV ( watch here ) takes a regular Joe Schmoe and states that his girlfriend removed his spine made him go shopping instead of letting him 's tay home to watch the game They then encourage him to change out of his skirt and get a FloTV so he can watch sports on the go AKA in the mall In another ad Dockers ( watch here ) incorporates a slogan that is as old as the day is long when it comes to relationships They re calling all men and instructing them that it 's time to wear the pants We all know what that means But it was Dodge Chrysler 's Super Bowl spot ( watch here ) that got feminists fired up the most Titled Man 's Last Stan dthe narrator is as bold as they come saying I will get up and walk the dog at 6 30AM I will eat some fruit as part of my breakfast I will shave I will clean the sink after I shave I will be at work by 8am I will sit through two hour meetings I will say yes when you want me to say yes I will be quiet when you don t want to hear me say no I will take your call I will listen to your opinion of my friends I will listen to your friends opinions of my friends I will be civil to your mother I will put the seat down I will separate the recycling I will carry your lip balm I will watch your vampire TV shows with you I will take my socks off before getting into bed I will put my underwear in the basket And because I do this I will drive the car I want to drive Know why this is funny Because ALL men have felt this way before If you haven t then you must not be married haven t talked to married men or haven t been in any type of relationship long enough to experience this robot-like lifestyle It 's like being a shell of a man where you lose the balls to say no or disagree You simply do as you re told because thinking on your own and doing what you want causes too much drama in your relationship And you hate drama Therefore you rather just say yes dear and go with whatever she says like a zombie You do this because you love her and want to make her happy even though living this way makes you miserable Then finally something comes along in this case the car you ve always wanted that makes you finally put your foot down You realize you take enough shit and do enough for her So it 's time to do something for yourself I WILL DRIVE THE CAR I WANT TO DRIVE I can t say I like Dodge Chargers but I love this commercial because I ve always said I will refuse marriage or get divorced before any woman forces me to buy a car I don t want I will NEVER own a minivan There are lots of things I will compromise on but my car is just not one of them And I don t care if any women thinks my Ducati is impractical either My sportbike is like my Bulldog Both will stay and you will go I am man Hear me roar PS ( I secretly loved the Google commercial best of all It made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside I guess that makes me a sexist pig with a soft center )

Catch the goose We had our opening night today Or premiere Do you call it premiere in English I 'm not sure Anyway it was a success The shot you see I took from where I sit at the piano and I had to shoot from the hip because I had to make sure the audience didn t see me taking the shot Fun Party We had a lot of fun on stage and later had an after show party We hung out until 4 AM and I was so drunk I could hardly walk home Water n ice Yuki was at his daycare all day and I had some time to get my software working I do have lots and lots of sound libraries and I find it difficult to make them work The architecture seems different than on my last computer and somehow they re not recognized by my music software It 's long process to get them to work properly It has been extremely cold in the last days Siberian cold The winter just doesn t want to stop Yuki has a cold again I think this time he also got an eye infection Need to go see the doctor No wonder in this cold Today we had our last rehearsal It went well and we re set for tomorrow Ended the day in a restaurant close to the theatre I still have an undeveloped film in my Nikon I ll a the missing pics when they re finished Almost human This morning our new CD 's arrived Yeah A new CD it 's always nice It 's our band 's 10th CD Yuki slept until 10AM that 's 14 hours After he woke up we went to the zoo where I met Anna Sofie the costume designer from the theatre We hung out until 1PM she feels a bit lonely because she 's from Munich and knows nobody here so I asked her to come to the Zoo with me After she left Sabina came we had lunch at the zoo together I have Yuki all day until 7 when I have to go to the rehearsals again A long day First working on the music with Josephine then off to rehearsals where we tried out our new music after rehearsalsI changed what didn t work then went back to the theatre where we had the first of three run through rehearsals before opening night after rehearsals we had a 2 hour critique with the entire crew and then finally went to a restaurant for some food and wine The rehearsal went really well Joshua watched the play for the first time and liked it very much I think the opening will be fine The new music worked perfectly We were able to incorporate it into the play with only one 2 hour rehearsal not bad at all I came home at 2 30 AM wasted Pink A beautiful Sunday with perfect weather for a trip to the Zoo I had Yuki and we both went there in a good mood There were millions of people at the zoo I usually go during the day and the zoo is often nearly empty but on Sundays it 's a nightmare I 'm not used to that Later I had to work a lot because I had to do last minute adjustments to the music Tomorrow morning Josephine 's coming to my studio and I have to be prepared We were supposed to have a musical rehearsal today at the theatre but the whole sound system broke down so we had to cancel it This is getting tight now There 's still a lot of a itional music we have to try out now that the acting is in place and I wonder when we will do it It 's getting tight Since I had a lot of free time after the cancellation of the rehearsal I decided to rip my studio apart and start to setup my new equipment I know I should wait until after opening night never should do that kind of stuff in the mi le of a project but I want to finish this as quickly as possible as I am getting tired of my old studio It was a nightmare Millions of cables But by midnight I was nearly finished and I can tell you it 's fantastic I threw all of my old studio furniture out I now have a small clean table with my new MacBook Pro and the studio monitors on it very clean very tidy Then about 12 Teras of new har isk power in a cabinet and that 's it Brand new software Mac OS 10 6 2 Aperture 3 Protools 8 Logic Studio 9 and a lot of positive energy to go along with it It will take some time to get everything running smoothly but I 'm very optimistic Rehearsal In the morning again rehearsals then I spent most of the day as I did yesterday installing software on my new Mac It 's very time consuming but well worth the effort I ll be at the front of the pack again after falling back in the last 2 years New sounds new software new OS I love Macs they re the best Then I composed some new music for the play Last minute adjustments so to speak Another world This morning we had a so called AMA in German which means Alles mit Allem in English All with all 'm eaning costumes light and makeup It went pretty well better than anticipated We had our wigs for the first time and we locked hilarious Interesting most interesting really was this As you might remembr our clarinet player Mike has become an orthodox jew He used to be a catholic but converted to Judaism 10 years ago For this rehearsal he had to shave and put on his wig Within a few minutes all that was jewish about him has vanished The clothes the skull cap the beard the body language everything And why Because it 's not real he 's not Jewish He looked like he looked 15 years ago a boy from a small village in southern Germany

What an amazing adventure I d say we crammed one month into a week as the Snoopy Goes To Cuba tour rolled through Havana Our little squad of American cartoonists visited with Cuban counterparts at newspapers animation studios and design schools We dropped in at Hemingway 's house but he wasn t home We even looked for him at all his favorite bars in downtown Havana but he wasn t there either The Cuban people couldn t have been sweeter prompting my new expression :\ You don t meet people in Cuba you fall in love with them The narrow streets of the city are filled with people ( as opposed to cars ) not to mention music and dancing I have never felt so safe walking around in dark alleys at midnight The poverty and deprivation are obvious everywhere but are not enough to dampen their spirits These photos include Jeannie Schulz and me with old Havana in the background

it by buying the book through me Or not mostly I just want to disclose this info nbsp The Chicago Flower and Garden Show was last week You can see my last post on the show on Chicago Garden titled Garden Hits and Misses at Chicago Flower and Garden Show Overall I really enjoyed the themed gardens and walked away with some good ideas that I hope to incorporate somewhere One of the highlights of the show was attending the lecture by Anna Pavord author of Bulb If you haven t bought or read Bulb you should because it is a wonderful garden book with great information on bulbs The bulbs range from Amaryllis bulbs to hardy garden bulbs like tulips I ve said before that I liked Bulb because it reads like something written by a gardener who loves bulbs corms and tubers My idea of Ms Pavord as a real bulb-loving gardener was solidified after hearing her lecture She spoke about bulbs with a passion that can t be faked Her presentation was filled with bulb recommendations for various growing conditions from her experiences growing these bulbs in her own garden My nbsp favorite nbsp anecdote nbsp of hers about how her Amaryllis bulb collection was blooming over the holidays and she wished that people would visit just so that someone besides her would be able to appreciate the blooms Just how serious of a bulb grower is Ms Pavord There were hundreds of tulip bulbs in bloom at the Chicago Flower and Garden Show and she spotted this one among a sea of perfect tulip blooms This purple and white tulip is broken and the coloring is caused by a virus During the Dutch Tulip Craze bulbs with dual colorings were highly sought-after and commanded ridiculous prices This particular bulb gave her an opportunity to talk about the snowdrop craze that is currently sweeping England where gardeners are paying hundreds of pounds for single bulbs She told us about parties and gatherings with Brits crawling around gardens on all fours counting spots on the leaves of snowdrops The snowdrop craze in England won t result in an economic crash but it is interesting to see how even though we know our history we are perfectly content to repeat it I can t recommend Bulb enough and if you are lucky enough to have Ms Pavord visit your area to promote the book do yourself a favor and go hear her talk about bulbs After the presentation I got a chance to sit and talk with her for a few minutes and she even personalized my copy of her book It reads :\ To Mr Brown Thumb- it was good to meet you in Chicago Happy blogging ( amp gardening ) Best wishes from Anna Pavord Yes I got a famous garden author and international best-selling author to a ress a book to MrBrownThumb I hope she chuckles over it for years to come I know I will nbsp Another lecture I attended during the show was about the history of the D Landreth Seed Company by owner Barbara Melera nbsp The D Landreth Seed Company is America 's oldest seed house She sells some really interesting herb vegetable and flower seeds If you re an African-American gardener check out the company 's African-American Hertiage Collection of seeds I picked up a few seed packets and some Maris Piper seed potatoes nbsp From the Dutch bulb growers I bought a Eucomis Comosa a Pineapple Lily with pink to burgandy blooms The circular corm is for a hardy cyclamen and the smaller one is a Dracunculus vulgaris Last year I purchased a Voodoo Lily from these guys and it bloomed before it was warm enough to put it outside The smell that took over the house was horrid Here is last year 's bulb with the original bloom fading and a new one emerging The greater Chicago cactus amp Succulent Society booth was awesome I purchased a new Euphorbia obesa Albuca longipes ( bulb in the center ) and a Tephrocactus articulatus on the left nbsp Kedrostris africana the bulbous plant on the left Fockea crispa center top and a Cyphostemma juttae (T ree grape ) on the left The green mound in lower half of the center is Selaginella K Brownii

without my expressed written consent will cause me to release the flying monkeys http // mrbrownthumb blogspot com nbsp I noticed today that for the past three years Burpee seeds I find at garden centers and nurseries end up being blogged about So I guess this is the 4th Annual Burpee Seeds post which probably makes this more of a Burpee Seed Watch by now In last year 's Burpee Seeds at Home Depot post I pointed out how the Cypress Vine labeled Burpee seeds were what most people call Cardinal Climber I ve never grown Cardinal Climber but I have grown Cypress Vine and it is my absolute favorite climbing vine to grow in the garden The first time I saw what I know to be Cypress Vine labeled as Cardinal Climber by Burpee I thought it had to be an error then I thought Who am I to question a seed giant like Burpee But then I came across these two seed packets at Menards and I was again left scratching my head I purchased these two packets of Burpee seeds at Menards The one on the right is packaged as an heirloom and the one on the left is just a regular packet They re both the same weight and price and seem to use the same photograph The heirloom packet lists Cypress Vine and Cardinal Climber as the common name I know that common names vary from region to region and from person to person A Google search for Cypress Vine will result in page after pages of results discussing ( or picturing ) the Cypress Vine I grow Similarly a search of Ipomoea quamoclit the botanical name listed on the heirloom package will return results for Cypress Vine Do a search for Cardinal Climber or Ipomoea stoleri or Ipomoea x multifida and you ll get results for Cardinal Climber the plant pictured on these two seed packs Park Seeds sells the vine pictured in these two seed packets as Cardinal Climber Ipomoea x multifida So what is up with the Cypress Vine sold by Burpee Was there a name change that I haven t been able to find or is this an error on Burpee 's part I don t think an error like this would ve gone unnoticed by gardeners who are sticklers for properly identified plants To most gardeners this probably doesn t matter but I 'm a seed nerd who likes to know what he 's buying and things like this keep me up at night Most of my seed purchases are done in local big box garden centers and nurseries since they re what are conveniently available Being far more familiar with Home Depot Menards WalMart Kmart and Lowe 's than I usually care to admit I know there are differences in prices for just about everything The same can be said for seed packets and if you look you can save yourself a few cents Here are two Burpee seeds packets both for Cosmos Seashells Mix The seed packet on the right was purchased at Menards where all the seeds were on sale After the 's ale price was taken into account it came out to 1 07 before taxes The seed package on the left came from Walmart 's garden center and retailed for 1 00 before taxes What makes the Cosmos seed packet from Menards more expensive The bilingual labeling nbsp The pricing was the same at Kmart with Walmart beating both retailers even taken into consideration their 's ales It isn t just the pricing the size of the selection varies at these garden centers and nurseries Kmart 's Burpee seed display is downright pitiful Home Depot didn t have their Burpee display out but it is usually a small island The selection seemed to be larger at Walmart with Menards coming in a second This is the first year that I visited Lowe 's in my seed buying adventures and while the display wasn t as large as Walmart 's or Menards the selection looks to be different They carry the Burpee Signature series which is a blue seed packet that I ve never seen before The varieties of seeds look to be fancier like the name implies I couldn t resist picking up some seed packets of Viola Blackjack The prices are higher with no 's ale when I visited but for premium seeds I don t mind paying a few cents more If you ll be buying Burpee seed at either of these locations visit them all and compare the prices and varieties before making your final selection Burpee Blacklist When I discovered I had an interest in gardening the first seed company I became aware of was Burpee I 'm not sure if I made the connection myself or if it was as a result of knowing older gardeners at the time who were from generations of Burpee seed buyers I came into gardening wanting to be a Burpee costumer nbsp The first seed catalog I ever requested 12 years ago now was a Burpee seed catalog Over the years I ve requested one off and on The o thing is that the darn seed catalog never comes I don t know if I have mailman stealing my seed catalogs or if I 'm on the seed catalog equivalent of a No-Fly list nbsp In January one Email led to another and I ended up exchanging Emails with Kristin Grilli who is in charge of public relations at Burpee She couldn t have been nicer and more accommodating even offering me the opportunity to speak with George Ball Chairman of Burpee In the same Email she informed me that she was going to have a Burpee and Cook 's Garden seed catalog sent out to me and that I would have it by the next week nbsp I know I 'm late for the Golden Age of Burpee 's seed catalog but I wouldn t be honest if my heart didn t flutter at the thought of holding a seed catalog that I ve longed for since I was in my late teens amp early twenties I didn t take Ms Grilli up on her offer to interview Mr Ball because wanted to look through the catalog and do some research first Every day since that Email I ve walked out to the mailbox like an old spinster thinking this would be the day a letter from the one that got away would arrive I even checked the mailbox on Sundays because you never know with Chicago mailmen It has now been over a month and no sign of the Burpee seed catalog I ve waiting 12 years I 'm not sure how much more of this I can take I 'm now convinced that I 'm on some kind of list for bad gardeners nbsp Seed Starting Tips Read these previous posts if you re looking for seed starting information and tips Seed starting in plastic soda bottles Seed starting in plastic baggies Seed starter pots from news paper Home made seed pots Paper tube seed pot holders Update The morning after I published this post I nbsp received a call from Ms Grilli who was calling me to make sure she had my a ress correct because she was going to overnight me the catalogs that hadn t arrived Thanks for going through the trouble Ms Grilli like I said it wasn t necessary but I do appreciate it Here is what came this morning The Burpee seed catalog which is more awesome amp wet than I could imagine thanks to lazy postal workers the Cook 's Garden seed catalog a nice catalog with an interesting selection of fruits veggies and herbs Finally The Heronswood catalog which seemed to escape the water / snow damage caused by the mailman throwing the package onto the snowy stairs On the cover of the Heronswood catalog is a black hellebore (\ Onyx Odyssey ) that is out of this world I ve been on the Heronswood site before but haven t really paid it much attention but looking through the catalog I can see I 'm going to have to change that I can t stop drooling over the Heronswood catalog while I wait for the other two to dry out In the comment of the post Nathan gave his theory as to why the seeds with the Walmart label ( above ) were less expensive than the ones bought at Menards He got me curious so I opened the packets of seeds to compare them Do you see a difference in the quality of the seeds Chicago Garden MrBrownThumb my blog about indoor outdoor gardenin I provide a feed people who are interested in gardening following my blog Re-publishing of my

books to review on my garden blog and wanted to share them with you The links below will be to Amazon where you can purchase them and if you buy them from me I ll get a small commission on the sale It is a good way of supporting this garden blog if you find it useful Grow Your Own Drugs and Grow Great Grub Good garden books for beginner gardeners Ever since I first visited the medicinal plant garden in Chicago I ve wanted to create a garden where I could grow many herbs annuals and perennials that are used in alternative medicines The idea of being able to create all-natural remedies from ingredients I d grow and harvest right in my own garden really appeals to the urban homesteader inside me It is a shame that with every successive generation we move further and further away from growing pharmacies in our gardens like our ancestors did heck our grandparents did When I heard of the BBC Two documentary series Grow Your Own Drugs by ethnobotanist James Wong that has him trying natural remedies on members of the public I wished it aired here in America It hasn t been picked up or copied by American broadcasters but fortunately his book Grow Your Own Drugs is being published in America this month and I ve got my hands on a copy of this international best-selling book Grow Your Own Drugs isn t as nefarious as it sounds it is all perfectly legal stuff and just teaches you how to use the various healing properties of many plants that you can grow in your own garden This book is set up like a cook book with a list of ingredient and equipment ( mortar and pestle glass jars-simple things you probably already have ) that you ll use often and should have on hand Nothing seems terribly expensive and can be found at your local home goods store and health foods store Grow Your Own Drugs teaches you how to make things like teas creams lotions balms gargles and cough syrups for common ailments from plants you can grow in your garden It guides you through creating natural remedies for things like digestive disorders skin complaints aches amp pains and female problems The 60 + recipes are easy to follow and most consist of only a handful of ingredients If you don t have a lot of space for growing the plants that make up the ingredients you stick to growing the Top 10 medicinal herbs and source the others from places like your local farmers market health food store or a regular grocery store The last third of the book lists the Top 100 medicinal plants by fruit vegetables trees amp shrubs roots herbs and flowers and leaves The suggested plants section contains some information on growing but it mostly lists the beneficial properties of the plants and the growing conditions and times of years you could forage for them With a few exceptions the majority of these plants are plants you can find in your local garden center or grow from seed Now that I know that lady 's mantle can be made into a salve to stop bleeding in cuts and wounds or to ease itchy skin I 'm going to have to stop letting the dogs pee on my plants Grow Your Own Drugs is a pretty cool book and one I d recommend to gardeners who would like to dabble with making their own remedies for common ailments or who like to grow productive gardens It is published in the U S by Reader 's Digest and retails for 19 95 Growing your own food Grow Great Grub Organic Food from Small Spaces is Gayla Trail 's second book It is a beautifully produced book on edible gardening perhaps the most beautifully done book on the subject I ve ever seen Grow Great Grub is filled with information and tips on composting seed starting suggestions on which vegetables herbs and edible flowers you should grow what vegetables herbs and flowers you should grow based on the site conditions of where you plan on vegetable gardening There are even recipes to help you prepare dishes so that you use the crops your garden produces For crafty gardeners or people who aren t afraid of small DIY gardening project Gayla included a few like the upside down tomato container If you have ever been on the You Grow Girl garden blog or the gardening forum you ve no doubt noticed Gayla 's trademark graphic design style The design of Grow Great Grub is very much like that of the garden blog and gardening forum Curling up with her latest book feels like you re curling up with the You Grow Girl site without your lap getting hot from the overheating laptop Grow Great Grub is a beautiful vegetable gardening book filled with good gardening information and inspiring photos that makes vegetable gardening look stylish and affordable to younger gardeners and those of us without huge gardening budgets This is a great vegetable gardening book for people in urban areas who only have small spaces like balconies decks porches or rooftops who want to get into growing some of their own food It is written in a casual and fun style that new gardeners will be able to relate to and understand If you want to be an urban farmer or urban homesteader pick up a copy of Grow Great Grub it is the only vegetable gardening book you ll need for a couple of years It is published by Clarkson Potter and retails for 19 99 There is some overlap in the plants you can grow for these two books Buy both of them and you can create a sustainable-themed garden that you can use to feed and heal yourself

website / blog without my expressed written consent will cause me to release the flying monkeys http // mrbrownthumb blogspot com Earlier this week I was invited by Mike Nowak to be a guest on his Chicago gardening radio show Being a regular listener of the show I was excited about the opportunity but really scared It is a weird feeling to be asked to come around from behind the computer and be MrBrownThumb in person The first time that happened I had the benefit of going in with other garden bloggers and it feeling like someone had my back Part of the reason I don t like to do it besides people not asking regularly is that I 'm not sure the MrBrownThumb 's htick translates outside of blogs and 140 character tweets So after being invited to be on the radio show I quickly had to improvise another security blanket to help me cope with the stress I asked Mike if I could bring my laptop in and perhaps incorporate Twitter into the segment He agreed and this morning I headed down to the radio station extra early I got there so early for my segment that I nbsp had time sit down to read Waking Up in Eden and was a couple of chapters in when Mike 's producer came running into the room I was waiting in and said I was up The next thing I remember I 'm sitting in a studio with a microphone in my face and my fingers tapping at the keys of my laptop posting something on Twitter Mike introduced me as something to the effect of the King of Twitter ( honestly I can t remember exactly what he said ) to which I replied that I was the Court Jester and that Ron Wolford having way more followers deserved the title The rest of the half-hour segment is as much of a blur as how I got into the studio and into the seat but I was fortunate to once again have gardeners who had my back Several garden bloggers and gardeners on Twitter were listening to the show and they became part of the live radio show Here is a list of those that tweeted at me during the segment Xanboni The Yarden nbsp Alexander_Roman MySkinnyGarden HoneyCoop UrbanGarden (T he King of Horticulture and Social Media ) FineDiving Kiss My Aster NSandlin nbsp JPirovano TomNTMJ Even some gardeners outside of Chicago were listening BG_Garden ( Ohio ) SJones71 ( Connecticut ) IndoorGarden-er (W ashington DC ) Get In The Garden (W estern NY State ) If you re looking for a fun bunch of people to follow on Twitter give these tweeple a follow If you don t do Twitter visit their Twitter account any way and check out the profile links because many of them are gardeners and bloggers too My favorite part of the segment was seeing some of them get a kick out of hearing their names said on the radio Garden Corporate Shill The one part of the show that wasn t a blur was talking about how I like to blog about seed saving and seed starting Right after that Mike asked me if I had started my seeds yet I answered that I hadn t because I had yet to check out what the big box 's tores were carrying I said this right as he was segueing into a commercial for a local garden center that get this had their seed supplies ready for customers Did I really go on Chicago 's Progressive Talk on a gardening radio show with lots of local gardening sponsors and mention that I shop at big box 's tores Yes yes I did After the show I had almost convinced myself that I hadn t committed such a fabulously idiotic faux pas I had almost talked myself into believing it hadn t happened but then I checked my phone and saw a message from a gardener who noticed that I gave an unintended shout-out to the big box garden centers At least @T heYarden benefited from hearing about Sid 's Greenhouse and said she was going there to shop Maybe that will balance out my karma Why I like Twitter nbsp I know Twitter isn t for everyone and not everyone will get it but I really like it for now Besides it being a place where I can get the validation my parents never gave me as a child I think it is as great place to meet fellow gardeners As I mentioned on the show I like how I was able to connect the Cook County Master Gardeners with Renee 's Garden and seeing the donation of 500 seed packets she made to them Twitter made that possible nbsp I hope the interactions that Mike had during his radio show with gardeners on Twitter propel him to a social media into the programing I know sometimes when I 'm listening to him amp Beth Botts I feel the urge to chime in but don t feel like picking up the phone Being able to send a quick question or comment to the show would be great Plus there 's the ability to tap into a national audience that could be listening online like those gardeners from outside Chicago were doing today We may not all live in the same gardening Zone but we all speak plants I 'm grateful to Mike and his crew for being so nice and for the opportunity to be on the show It was scary but it was a lot of fun and now I wish I had a radio show all of my own 0 ) You can listen to The Mike Nowak Show on WCPT 820 AM in Chicago on Sunday 's from 8-10AM It is always informative for gardeners and really funny He has a regular column that runs in Chicagoland Gardening magazine that you should check out

Your Own Eat Your Own by Bob Flowerdew While flipping through the pages I was charmed by the photography design of the book and food styling for the recipes Yes I judge books by their cover and the whole look of the book is a bit of a shock for someone accustomed to the antiseptic ( in a good way ) design of books and magazines by Martha Stewart or Organic Gardening magazine While they contain good information and are aesthetically pleasing it sometimes bothers me to see hand models with perfectly manicured fingernails and oxford shirts in gardening publications Where was I Oh yes Everything about the garden ( farm ) that 's pictured in this book would probably give Martha Stewart a heart attack An old garden gate leaning against a pile of unidentifiable junk strawberries growing in tire planters a backyard vineyard planted in white buckets missing windowpanes a la er leaned against the grape arbor that leans against a dilapidated shed All of these beautifully flawed vignettes would probably be cropped out of photos or not show at all in most garden books and magazines In Grow Your Own Eat Your Own the largest photos are dedicated to the chaos of a real garden one that isn t concerned about the way it looks because the purpose of the garden is to grow fresh organic crops Who is Grow Your Own Eat Your Own for Gardeners and the latest urban and backyard agriculture enthusiasts People interested in a sustainable way of life where they re connected to the food they re putting on their table While you can find many books about growing your own food they only guide you to a certain point What do you do with the crop you grow so much of you don t know what to do with besides unloading it on your friends and family And what to do with that crop that doesn t yield you enough to share with your friends and family How do you keep all of that fresh produce fresh Not many gardening books give you practical advice such as preserving canning juicing or give recipes that make the most of the crops your grow Grow Your Own Eat Your Own does What I like the most about the ideas for preserving and recipes is that it doesn t look like you need fancy kitchen gadgets and appliances to make the dishes preserves and deserts suggested After you ve picked out all of the vegetables and fruit trees you want to grow in your garden pick up a copy of Grow Your Own Eat Your Own so you know how to preserve and produce your grew in your garden I wasn t familiar with Bob Flowerdew before I received a copy of this book but the book jacket informs me that he is Britain and Europe 's leading organic gardener With a surname like Flowerdew it probably shouldn t have come as a surprise but it did Other books by Mr Flowerdew of interest to gardeners and backyard farmers include Bob Flowerdew 's Organic Bible The No-Work Garden and The Gourmet Gardener You can read the writeup I did for Bulb by Anna Pavord on my Chicago Garden blog The links to Amazon

Hello again all I join you briefly today to discuss a little bit of Internet security We all know how dangerous the web can be if you are not careful about what you view and download so we all take the usual precautions and hope for the best Well sometimes the best doesn t happen and you re left with a nasty virus noisome malware or some other sort of security vulnerability Most users are caught unawares by these issues and when they realize what 's going on they usually don t know what to do That 's why it 's good that there are sites like PCThreat com out there I got an email about PCThreat com a while ago and while honestly I usually ignore such emails PCThreat com actually seemed like a useful site Every day I hear about peoples computers getting viruses or griding to a halt under adware and so often do I hear the scared cry of someone who thinks their computer is about to blow up because of all this stuff Well I can usually tell them that nothing is going to blow up but really however annoying these problems are they are usually fixable and most often preventable That 's where PCThreat com comes in They have a really good website that outlines a lot of the troublemakers that are out there in the vast tubes of the Internet I was looking through their list of Parasites and came across some interesting things - such as a rouge antispyware programs that seem to be helpful but are actually dangerous malware programs Ironic eh And while many skilled users out there will laugh at this the fact is that many people don t know the good from the bad on the internet and fall victim to these kinds of scams PCThreat com has information on thousands of these sorts programs seeking to cause you harm or violate your privacy Of course when you actually have one of these nasty things on your computer you often don t really care what it is as long as you can get it off as quickly as possible PCThreat com again comes in handy here with instructions on how to alleviate your computer 's malware ailments For example check out their page on the Trojan Agent cbdr trojan They have an excellent description of the infection and also list in simple terms the danger level and the common symptoms (s ee the sidebar on the page ) Very useful indeed Everyone loves to browse the web but it is important to remember to do so safely Check out PCThreat com and become more educated today Every so often as I wander my way through the myriads of blogs in the blogosphere I stumble across one that strikes me as possessing a certain 's omething that sets it apart from the usual monotone self-absorbed blogging world one is exposed to on a daily basis Other times that blog happens to stumble upon you Recently I was contacted by a very nice teen who happened to be Spanish and wanted to share some bloggings I checked out his blog and although it was in Spanish I liked what I saw ( I am actually learning Spanish in school at the moment and I 'm quite enjoying the language ) It 's a fledgling blog but I think it has potential and the fact that the author contacted me was pretty cool (p rops to you man ) Really it all kinda reminds me of when I started blogging I never really thought anyone would take notice of my blog However I spoke to some more experienced bloggers and they helped me out ( thanks :) ) Sometimes all it takes is a link to get a new blog going Anyways way check out the site HERE is a link for the blog in full Spanish and HERE is one translated w / Google to English Note from the Nerd Gotta love that name too eh The best start is a good name :D One of the few problems I experienced in my recent fresh install of Ubuntu 8 04 ( Hardy Heron ) was the non-functionality of the media keys on my Saitek Eclipse II keyboard This problem came as quite the o surprise seeing as the keys worked great in 7 04 and 7 10 It has always been puzzling to me that a new release can actually take a step backwards in terms of device compatibility but what do I know I don t code it so it must be harder than it looks Either way I soon set out to find a solution for this irksome issue I had on my hands Who would have guessed that salvation came in the form of a Gentoo wiki page Nice eh Well if you have explored that link a bit you may note that it is quite lengthy and perhaps just a tad confusing for the Linux newbie So I bring you my simplified version I have taken only the essential steps that were required to get the media keys on my Saitek Eclipse II keyboard working I am sure that the guide works for other keyboards as well The first step of this process is find the raw scancodes that the kernel spits out and X interprets when a key is pressed To do this in a nice simple fasion issue the following command and press the keys you would like to configure in an order that you can remember xev sed -n s / ^ -keycode - \([ 0-9 ]\ + \) - / keycode 1 = / p uniq Close the window when you are done There should be an out put left that looks somewhat like so keycode 36 = keycode 144 = keycode 162 = keycode 164 = The first line isn t actually a media key so just ignore / delete it Now we must set up xmodmap to recognize the keys and assign them their proper keysyms In your home directory create a file named Xmodmap In this file you will enter the appropriate keysysm to match the media key My file ended up looking like this keycode 162 = XF86AudioPlay keycode 164 = XF86AudioStop keycode 144 = XF86AudioPrev keycode 153 = XF86AudioNext You can find all possible keysyms listed in the following file on Ubuntu / usr / share / X11 / XKeysymDB This should now all be automatically loaded at startup If it doesn t try / usr / bin / xmodmap HOME / Xmodmap Now that we have the keys properly identified and configured we can assign them to the actions of our choice I like to have my keys set up in Amarok so I set the to their respective functions under Settings Configure Global Shortcuts You can also set the keys through gnome by going to System Preferences Keyboard Shortcuts However in the past I have noted that this can cause conflict with Amarok so I usually just leave the keys disabled in the Keyboard Shortcuts dialog ( Amarok will handle them just fine that way ) If all went well that should get you full support for you mutlimedia keys in Ubuntu and Amarok If it doesn t work then take a look around the wiki page maybe you will find something that fixs the issue or ( even better ) inspires you to come up with your own hacks and workarounds :D Have fun Note from the Nerd Many thanks to the people who contributed to the Gentoo wiki page I have so extensively referenced in this post Hello all I start this summer 's posting off with a review of the topic that is on everyone 's mind of course the new Ubuntu release Or rather it was on everyone 's minds Seeing as I just didn t have the time to crank out a review during the entire post-release-blog-all-you-can-about-Ubuntu hype fest I bring you my review now and hope that it reaches just a few of you out there Let 's get started Installation What can I say I love Ubuntu installations As with most previous releases Hardy Heron comes on a nice LiveCD through which you can dip your toes into Linux and decide whether or not to take the plunge As for me I ve done my fair share of dabbling so I tend to just boot up the CD to see if the preliminaries work ( wifi sound video ( ish ) etc ) With Ubuntu there is a great probability that a large percentage of your hardware will be detected ( if not as in many cases all ) and configured properly right off the bat On loading the CD you have the choice to try the Try Ubuntu Without Making Any Changes to Your System go straight to the install boot normally check the CD for defects or test memory Choosing the Try Ubuntu Without Making Any Changes to Your System will get you into the nice LiveCD mode From there you can test out your internet connectivity and check and see if your basic hardware has been detected Clicking the installer icon on the desktop will start the installer The installer is excellent as usual and even the unassuming Linux newbie can figure out what to do Most of the process consists of the standard language / time / user / password setup The installer also features an assistant to help import your bookmarks and other preferences from older versions of Ubuntu or other operating systems My favorite part of Ubuntu 's installer continues to be the integration of the nice gparted disk partitioner GUI It really makes a difference seeing how the hard drive is layed out Other distributions like openSUSE don t have this nice visual aid and can be confusing Ubuntu really has it figured out In its entiretity the install was amazingly simple The total install time on my AMD 3700 + system was about half an hour ( about 10 min of which were spent messing w / my partition scheme ) First Impressions and Usability Usually this is the time when I grip about how ugly Ubuntu looks but honestly why bother I can theme it all I like and quite seriously Ubuntu has a much more refined look than any other distribution I have ever come across I 'm actually kinda warming up to the whole brown-orange theme In Hardy Heron especially I find it to be tastefully done and altogether not all too obtrusive Ubuntu scores big again on hardware support in Hardy Heron All my devices worked and required practically zero configuration The exceptions to this are my wireless connection ( rate set at 1MB / s on startup ) and the media keys on my Saitek Eclipse II keyboard I ll discuss my solutions to these problems in upcoming posts Media support is great again too The helpful codec installer gets you all the plugins and codecs you need to jam to your favorite mp3s and ogle at your beloved DVDs I immediately installed Amarok seeing as it is the single best media player in existence and greatest thing since pre-compiled kernels ( aka good stuff ) Not sure what else to say everything just worked - ) Compiz can be simply enabled after installing the nvidia driver through the restricted driver manager and provides several levels of desktop-effects goodness Overall Overall Ubuntu 8 04 ( Hardy Heron ) is another great release in the Ubuntu line and surely deserves the prestigious LTS ( Long Term Support ) title that accompanies it So this hasn t been quite as inclusive as some of my other reviews but I ll be churning out a few other posts to explain my fixes for my keyboard and wireless issues I ll also update the review as I see fit ( hoping that some more inspiration will randomly come to me ) Hope you enjoyed what I did have - ) I 'm slowly getting back into the blogging world so give me some time to re-adjust Peace out everyone And remember have some fun with Linux this summer Many moons ago I posted about a fledgling project seeking to provide fully open graphics cards and drivers to the open source community and consequently the world After some separation from the tech world I have come back and note that this wonderful project has made some brilliant strides In fact it has come so far as to now offer pre-orders for their first card the OGD1 The road hasn t been an easy one The OGD1 design has actually been finished for a couple of months now In that time we ve been chasing a chick-and-egg problem We can take all the orders we want but there 's as much as an 8-week lead time between when we place our order for 100 boards and when we get them so that we can test and then ship them It would be inappropriate to charge our own customers until we ship to them That leaves us with a 60000 bill to pay before we have any revenue and that 's too much for Andy Howard and I to float on our own We didn t want to make a formal announcement for re-orders until we solved this problem The card will initially be offered at 1500 with discounts of 100 for the first 100 pre-orders But who is this card aimed at Obviously the 1500 price tag is a bit high for the performance offered so those seeking cutting edge graphics acceleration will have to look elsewhere ( Matrox ) Rather the card is meant for hackers and for those wanting to accelerate the pace of open graphics We often get inquiries about the use of OGD1 as a graphics card It can easily-enough function as a graphics card but for most such uses it is badly over-priced On the other hand OGD1 is very competitively priced as an FPGA development kit We need to make it clear what OGD1 is and why buying one is an important step for Free Software Check out the full announcement on the project 's mailing list or read a bit Kernel Trap Also be sure to visit the project 's wiki Everyone loves a good April Fools joke and this year the BBC came up with one which was quite appealing to the Linux crowd Since I am particularly partial to penguins I simply must share this video be it a week or so old now ( live with it you can never see too many penguins ) I ll let the video speak for itself However the true geek will want to know how this was made possible Of course CG can blurt out of anyones mouth but I 'm sure there was more put into this than just computer graphics So I went off to stroll the Internet in search of some behind the scenes footage Well leave it to BBC to make my search easy apparently I wasn t the only one asking questions after having seen this vid Here 's some great 'm aking-of footage But now what would a great joke be without a parody on it Leave it to digg to share the most random stuff on the Internets I recently found this rather nice Linux-themed improvement on the original video I particularly enjoyed the music on this one It is well made almost as though it were always meant to be a Linux commercial Well I hope that these penguins have brightened your day as they have mine today ( and for that matter the other 5 days I have watched this vid ) Recently my trusty 2GB Corsair Flash Voyager died on me when it 's head su enly popped off as I was attempting to use it It was one of those moments where your whole life just flashes before your eyes Ok so maybe it wasn t that bad and like all bad things this rather tragic incident had a quite enjoyable bright side Namely I got to buy a new flash drive Yes the nerd inside of me is still alive and kicking I decided to go with the same brand / model because it had been so good to me for the years of its service with one 's mall upgrade 4x times the storage - ) Yup that is 8GB of flash memory goodness in my pocket Great stuff really I got it off the egg for just 40 That 's how much the 2GB model cost a few years ago It is really crazy how much flash memory prices have gone down As one usually is when receiving new hardware / gadgets I was rather excited when the drive shipped just 2 days later ( I love you newegg ) I popped it in my computer and received an interesting surprise Instead of nautilus opening up I was greeted by gtkpod Apparently the drive was being recognized as a Digital Audio Player Annoyed I set off to find a solution to my problem Sadly forums were not much help but finally I found a post far back in the Ubuntu support forums that quelled my need for an answer According to Bug 90286 on launch pad I was not the only one experiencing these issues Check out the solution the Ubuntu forums That worked for me Now my drive is recognized as a normal USB disk I ll include these keywords to aid searchers Corsair Flash Voyager Recognized as Digital Audio Player IMPORTANT UPDATE I forgot to mention in my original posting that one of my best friends kindly saved my data for me as my flash drive was dying Using a complex system of holding the drive in place and quickly maneuvering through My Computer she managed to save the most essential of my data Here 's to you :: CHEERS :: The Asus Eee PC is one of the hottest new gadgets 'm aking its hype around the internet The sub-laptop became an instant hit offering extreme portability great performance and excellent productivity Some would say that the device is just about perfect Then there are some that want more And so we get awesome mods like this one from jkkmobile who mo ed a touchscreen into his Asus Eee PC Needless to say this thing is awesome and extremely sturdy to boot A HOW-TO is promised soon Check out the vid jkkmobile

I challenge you to try it This should stop that kind of nonsense Want a print A couple of toy eye balls Sir Lawrence Olivey-EyeJust because Also- My goal this week is to start working on more zombie related images You love em I love em so why not take advantage of this situation and make more Sometimes I get ideas that I need to follow through with even though I 'm not sure why Materials - One and a half packages of beef jerky ( I ate the other half ) 12 inches tall I got him to balance for about a minute at a time Just long enough to take a few photos This may be the first jerky sculpture on the internet I couldn t find any others in a quick search I found a dried beef dress but nothing else If it is the first then goody for me and I deserve some kind of prize like a couple of packages of good beef jerky Feel free to send me some Edit Feb 9 - Thanks to Joe for commenting and leaving this link This film was on my mind when I was making this jerky guy 
I didn t have a lot of studio time today so I looked for a small project I could quickly finish I d done the drawing for this painting about 6 months ago and thought I d be able to complete the underpainting in the short time available After about a week this layer should be dry and I ll be able to paint the color layer I think it should be a nice little painting I 'm looking forward to it Most of the in-progress images I post here are of work on the final color layer so I thought I d show a little window into work on the underpainting ( above ) Here 's the completed underpainting Tomorrow I ll be starting on a very very fun project I ll write a quick post about it in the evening Jeffrey Hayes In Progress 6 x 11 inches Actually this painting is done I won t post final images of it until it has dried and been varnished It 's probably hard to appreciate with this lower-quality shot but there 's a depth and richness to the color that I 'm very pleased with especially the copper which has become one of my favorite things to paint I managed to finish it despite the torrential downpours we got here in Eastern Massachusetts about 8 inches of rain in the last 48 hours - falling on saturated soil from another recent storm I now have a nice duck pond where my back yard used to be and water is flowing freely into my basement However so far the pumps have done their job and it 's been more of a nuisance than anything else Others nearby were far less fortunate mandatory evacuations submerged automobiles and all that Since I barely slept last night dealing with the water I 'm exhausted think I ll head off to bed early More progress and getting close to the finish At this point the biggest thing I need to worry about is anchoring the objects to the surface they re sitting on Objects which aren t properly painted in relation to their context never feel like they have the proper weight and gravity and as a result sit awkwardly in the painting And that of course just wouldn t do I wish you all a great weekend Jeffrey Hayes Work In Progress 5 x 11 inches Here is further progress on my current painting I really like the idea of building paintings around 2 opposed and unequal groups of objects It seems to lend the composition some built-in tension and intrigue I 'm almost tempted to call the painting Culture Clash or something similar though that 's probably more amusing to me than it is to most others Jeffrey Hayes In Progress 5 x 11 inches This is the very latest piece I ve been working on I don t ordinarily work on one larger piece immediately after finishing another larger piece but I d completed the underpainting for this some months ago and just wanted to get it done After this I ll be working on a very cool project more on that in a few days After my recent cancer experience I got a lot of messages of concern and support so I thought I d pass along some good news Today I had my first physical since then and overall I 'm in very good shape So back to work for me I d like to finish this one as soon as I can I haven t mentioned it here in a while but I have an active presence on both Facebook and Twitter I d like to invite everybody who reads this blog to join my Facebook fan page and follow me on Twitter Thanks Jeffrey Hayes Lime No 2 Oil on panel 4 x 4 inches (10 x 10 cm ) Dimensions with frame 8 x 8 inches (20 x 20 cm ) Available Purchase Information Jeffrey Hayes Lemon No 2 Oil on panel 4 x 4 inches (10 x 10 cm ) Dimensions with frame 8 x 8 inches (20 x 20 cm ) Available Purchase Information Thanks everybody for all the great comments you ve left over the past few weeks I really appreciate all of them I ll be sending out my next newsletter in a couple of days to get it please sign up here

Hey guys sorry I haven t posted in a while Rest assured we ll be back in full force soon In the meantime has anyone out there seen this site It 's totally gruel by which I mean great + cool Hey guys Sorry I haven t posted in a while but don t worry With this one the Short Box is back on track because it 's time to LOOK AT MY BOOBS Ha ha Not mine I mean Wonder Woman 's See back in the 90s comic book publishers used to use highly over-sexualized drawings of women to increase sales Ha ha can you believe that Using sex to sell products That 's so wacky Now that I think of it they might still be doing it today But I 'm not sure I haven t read any comics since 1996 Fortunately I have a stockpile of examples for when I get lonely and in my experience one of the worst perpetrators ( or worst titillators ha ha ha ) is Mike Deodato Some people might remember him from a run on Thor where he insisted on putting Asgardian go esses in thongs but he 's probably best well known for his work on Wonder Woman which was even more sexed-up than the standard at the time But heck he is the guy who had Dr Strange accidentally astral projecting himself into Elektra 's shower once Ha ha Get it He 's a dirty old wizard But anyway back to Wonder Woman Don t be fooled by that cover folks That might pass for a cleavage shot from Brian Bolland but it doesn t hold a candle to what you get once you re inside Oh man It looks like there 's a big arrow pointing between her boobs That is hysterical Some of you are no doubt wondering ( ha ha get it ) why the Wonder Woman in this comic has red hair and a drooling problem Well at this point in continuity Diana the regular Wonder Woman had been replaced by another Amazon called Artemis It 's sort of like that time that Superman was two guys or Batman was French and it lasted about as long As for the drooling well I think that was just mandatory If you ever want to know if you re reading a bad comic from the 90s just follow the checklist 1 Lots of hair Check 2 Copious amounts of spittle Check 3 Shouting about something with tiny feet at least two yards apart Check Or you can just look for it on this website Ha ha Doing stuff in list format makes it easier to write and easier to read As you can see she not only gets Wonder Woman 's job but also her clothes including a pair of sandals that grant the power of flight and a corset that grants the power to stand with one 's shoulder blades totally perpendicular to one 's ass This leaves Diana fighting crime in a fetching ensemble composed of bike shorts a bra with shoulder buckles and an entirely new article of clothing I ve decided to call Ab Straps But this issue isn t just about fashion There 's also the hint of a plot to keep things moving along Artemis is mad at Diana because everyone still thinks of her as Wonder Woman and so she tries to kill a crime boss and then Diana throws her through a building That 's pretty much it Oh except for the part where she 's put in tentacle bondage becuase it just wouldn t be Wonder Woman without that right Ha ha Man Comics sure were crappy back then huh Isn t it hysterical And that brings another installment of LOOK AT MY BOOBS to a close but before we go since us guys have had some eye candy here 's a little bit for the ladies Ha ha Crappy comics Hey guys Sorry I haven t posted in a while but things have been pretty crazy around here lately Rest assured that we ll be back to our regular posting schedule very soon In the meantime here 's an idea I had while I was looking over the 93 comments on my post about Wonder Woman wearing a thong What if from now on instead of saying something was cool we started using the word Ca yshack as a universally positive adjective Ha ha Wouldn t that be radical Or should I say Wouldn t that be Ca yshack Rumor has it that back in the day Brian Doyle Murray and Chevy Chase discussed this same thing happening and that on a dark night out on the golf course Chevy sacrificed chances of having an enduring career and a good reputation to make this very thing happen And now I 'm bringing it to you I know Sometimes I can t believe how clever and hilarious I am either But in order for this idea to bring me the mountains of fame that I totally deserve you guys are going to have to do all the work Why not start by using it in casual conversation with your friends or in post comments Then you can email these images to your friends or use them in your sig files on message boards Isn t that a totally Ca yshack idea you guys It 's simple visual comedy using found art that EVERYONE can enjoy Ha ha ha Check it out You can use it to express your opinion about baked goods Or your bowling team Or even your favorite movie Ha ha Isn t that great You can use it almost everywhere Just don t use it in reference to Ca yshack 2 because o ly enough that 's not Ca yshack at all Weird 
Let me break my blogging break to wish all those who start with month when writing their dates a wonderful Pi Day as March 14 or rather 3 14 represent the first three digits of the mathematical constant (p ronounced Pi ) The British and the rest of us however will have our Pi day on 22nd July (22/7) which is apparently a Pi Approximation Day since 22 /7 is not the precise value of Pi So if you re celebrating your day today have precise fun Looking forward to approximate celebration of celebration in July :) Some angry Moroccan has hacked the Africa Cup of Nations website after Morocco got beaten by Ghana the hosts 2-0 on Monday 28th January 2008 The website www ghanacan2008 com and below is the screenshot in case they ve fixed it now Update Fixed the url Thanks Jeff The website has been restored now I ve also changed the tooltip text on the photo from ghanacan2008 com hacked by soyapi on Flickr to ghanacan2008 com hacked Photo by soyapi on Flickr :) With that loss Morocco is now out of the competition We all know how physical exercises are good for your body That is equally true with your brain Regular brain exercises make your brain healthier That 's why newspapers usually include puzzles to help your brain as you relax during a short break at work or after work I remember playing the cross-number puzzle which features regularly in The Daily Times of Malawi when I was young To win the puzzle game you fill empty boxes with with one digit numbers (1-9) such that vertical horizontal and diagonal numbers in the inner 4x4 boxes a up to the sums in the bottom and right-most cells - similar to a cross-word puzzle Every time I saw a copy of the paper I would write down the puzzle on a piece of paper solve to it later I spent my childhood days in Chikwawa south of Blantyre and I would look forward to reading The Daily Times and solving a new puzzle whenever my father returned from a trip to Blantyre But when I started using computers I slowly found myself without pencils or pens and started shifting my reading medium from printed papers to electronic files That also meant playing less and less of my favourite puzzle game I 'm sure there are lots of you out there who used to solve this or similar puzzle games but no longer do so these days Maybe you ve started playing Freecell or other computer games and puzzles When I was learning computer programming back in 1998 one thing I really wanted develop was a program to help me play and solve that puzzle game The program would also be intelligent enough to solve a puzzle for me I remember starting to code it in dBase IV :) but got distracted and went on to code other things during my free time If you re one of those who enjoy solving puzzles that involve numbers I have some good news for you You can now play that cross number puzzle game this time online I have finally developed a web application that will let you play a game or solve one from The Daily Times or another source for you at http // soyapi com / puzzle New button gives you another Puzzle to Solve Create lets you upload a new game from the Daily Times or any other source Solve will give give a solution for the puzzle either created or generated using New You can use keyboard arrow keys to navigate through the cells or click on the white cells to enter the numbers But that 's not all What happens when you see a Puzzle in The Daily Times and want XNumber Puzzle to solve it for you but you re not on a computer with internet access What if you want a new game to solve on paper but can t find a copy of The Daily Times around Well you can go to http // soyapi com / puzzle / m via your GPRS enabled mobile phone Since most mobile phones don t support JavaScript you ll have to play it on paper And if you care about the technical details it 's not written in dBase IV Times have changed since 98 I used Ruby on Rails and little bit of good old C After almost 10 years I ve finally canceled the Cross Number Puzzle Player and Solver on my To Program list Now get your daily brain exercise Prescription 2 puzzles 3 times a day One reason I haven t blogged in the last 2 months is because of my other personal software projects As Dare Obasanjo once put it on his blog description Writing Code Will Always Be More Important Than Writing About Code I 'm therefore pleased to announce that SearchWith version 0 4 has been released and is available at Mozilla A ons SearchWith site ( a ons mozilla org / firefox /2194) SearchWith is search extension for Firefox Thunderbird and Flock It allows you group search engines by service ( content type ) and search from the context ( right-click ) menu Apart from big fixes this version includes improvements to the A ressbar option especially in Thunderbird A ressbar option now integrates well with Google 's Feeling lucky feature Another enhancement in this version is that when you search with all engines for a particular service SearchWith will automatically remember to pre-select all engines under that service by default To select all engines or change this back use the Advanced Search dialog which pops up when you hold down the SHIFT key while selecting a search service on the context menu or when you right-click without selecting any text Thanks to all those who sent comments suggestions and bugs I recently had the privilege of holding and playing with Apple 's iPhone Wow What an experience it was It was wonderful to play with the device 's on-screen keyboard iTunes Cover Flow shifting photo slides turning the little animal 90 degrees and the like What I realised after playing with the iPhone is that there is new paradigm of User Interfaces from What You See is What You Get (WY SWYG ) to What You See is What You Touch (WY SWYT ) Since Graphical User Interfaces came up with Windows Icons Mouse and Pointers (W IMP ) it has been fun moving a mouse beside a keyboard and watching something move accordingly on the screen Although it becomes a simple and wonderful user experience dragging and dropping stuff this way it requires a lot of getting used to initially Novice users have to learn some principles of the mouse e g it doesn t work if you lift the mouse in the air To be honest we can all agree that this is not a perfect user experience because in the real world if you want to open a door you don t move around and click some weirdly named device on one side while watching its effects on another You push or pull the door open If you want to poke or slap someone you poke or slap them As simple as that At Baobab Health we have seen how touchscreen systems are so intuitive to users No one needs a class to learn how to touch a button on the screen not even in developing countries I 'm therefore excited to see Apple bringing this user experience to the masses with their iPhone and iPod Touch devices Of course there have been others who developed Touchscreen systems way before Apple But Apple 's design genius and hype production behind their touch devices have opened doors to more simple intuitive and exciting user experiences Just hope Facebook 's touchscreen slap feature won t be as painful Tim O Reilly has written a post suggesting a source code version control web service for Google Gears applications While reading the post I was reminded of my what I ve been asking myself lately when I started porting one of my open source projects from the Desktop platform to the Web You see for desktop apps SourceForge provides open source projects with download services so that users can download and then install your application But web applications don t need downloading rather support for various server-side scripting languages server side database access monitoring tools and bandwidth The requirements are different For the non-commercials users the Sourceforge for Web2 0 can run mandatory ads on every application and impose bandwidth restrictions You can then allow developers to run their own ads and provide them with monitoring tools so they see for themselves when it 's time to go pro That should be workable right So far I haven t heard of any service like this It looks like Amazon is the only well-known company doing something similar with their web services division where they are providing storage and CPU services But as far as I know that 's only paid for services that don t include hosting various types of databases and scripting languages or does it cause that would be super cool WhiteAfrican has been playing African TechCrunch recently covering creative Africans working on cool startups right here in Africa Some of the interesting innovators covered that I really liked include Adventures of Nyangi A 3D Adventure game created by a

making headlines even at Digg and BoingBoing Malawi 's The Nation Newspaper of 2nd July 2007 also carried a feature article titled Behold the scientist from Malawi The same paper carried a programme by ESCOM Malawi 's electricity company detailing scheduled power outages running the whole week in various areas Some outages were scheduled from 05 00 to 13 30 and others from 17 45 to 21 00 Innovators like William have huge opportunities in Africa At TEDGlobal 2007 participants were privileged to listen to great speakers give their well prepared talks in Arusha Tanzania And indeed you ll agree with me when the videos get uploaded on web that they were great talks The sessions included both 18 minute talks and short 3 minute presentations by a diverse group of speakers including business leaders artists activists engineers inventors and musicians Among these was a 3 minute Question and Answer session where the curator Chris Anderson asked William Kamkwamba questions regarding the Windmill he created for his home in Kasungu Malawi at the age of 14 Through the Questions with photos on the slides William told his story which made people shed tears and later give him a big applause and a standing ovation In the sessions that followed William 's story became the most cited talk among the talks at this conference Speakers like Ory Okolloh of Kenyan Pundit journalist Dele Olojede and Noah A Samara of WorldSpace referred to William Kamkwamba 's tale of invention in their sessions The picture above shows Ory Okolloh who included the photo of William 's QnA session with Chris Anderson from the previous day in her slides Look out for the TED Talk videos from TEDGlobal 2007 when they re uploaded on TED 's website 
Reading Bob del Grosso 's blog I saw that fat is a 6th taste As Bob points out fat isn t a flavor - it is a taste I 'm reminded of the chart above about Mangalitsa pork from a Swiss book There 's a nice post here about our Mangalitsa lard I encourage everyone to compare whatever lard or shortening they ve got side-by-side with our Mangalitsa lard so they can see how superior our stuff is Besides Foods in Season Chef Shop is also selling Wooly Pigs brand lard There 's an article about butchery in the Sacramento Bee It had a quote that stood out :\ There are a lot of chefs getting into salumi and curing their own (p ork ) bellies and curing their own pork jowl and because of that rising interest in salumi you have to be fairly adept at butchery he said You don t have to be adept at butchery if you buy your pork from Wooly Pigs As described in this document we sell cuts that are ready to be cured whether by meat processors or chefs The chef doesn t need to know how to produce a neck or a belly - he just needs to have the money to pay for it I was talking with Michael Clampffer of Mosefund yesterday and he mentioned that he d sold some pork to Momofuku a famous New York City restaurant I found this blog post that mentioned it If I had to describe this extra fatty pork it would be foie gras pork If I had to describe Mangalitsa I d call it pork that 's actually worth eating There 's so much hype about pork these days but most of it isn t worth eating - and that includes heritage breeds The reason Mangalitsa gets so much press is that it tastes fantastic Other pork doesn t live up to whatever hype it has Americans are used to ignoring food hype When something is actually superior it makes waves I think the fact that Mangalitsa is incomparably better than all other pork just shows how pathetic pork is now - you d hope that some other pork would be somewhere close to Mangalitsa in eating quality Unfortunately for consumers there 's no pork produced in the USA that isn t Mangalitsa that comes close to Mangalitsa in quality Hopefully Momofuku will serve Mangalitsa again some day Curemaster Rufus Brown ( left ) I saw this on the web about Provenance Farms and their Mangalitsa pigs I got to meet Steve one of the owners of Provenance Farms in New Jersey at Mosefund where he helped to kill dehair butcher and process Mangalitsa pigs under the instruction of the guy who trained our processor how to cut pigs make lardo and Speck and so on I love the fact that due to the efforts of Wooly Pigs people across America - from California to Texas to Florida to to Maryland to New Jersey to Massachusetts to Minnesota to Missouri to Washington - are enjoying a new sort of extremely high quality food I 'm very pleased to see non-foodie Americans - the kind who own trucks and live away from the coasts and wear camo - producing this stuff That tells me that extreme lard-type pork isn t just a fad Speaking of which - from talking to Rufus Johnston County Hams is about to finish its first batch of hams bacon and cured jowl made from our pork Mike Sloan and his Mangalitsa lardo The Sausage Debauchery has a post about Mangalitsa lardo Knight Salumi is about to start making Mangalitsa lardo I 'm going to bet that in 2010 and 2011 American foodies will start to talk about how amazing Mangalitsa lardo is Pre-sliced Mangalitsa lardo - jalapeno flavor Wooly Pigs has finished its first batch of Mangalitsa lardo It was made by Swiss Meat amp Sausage Company the company that Christoph and Isabel Wiesner trained We did four flavors Inspired by the Wiesners ( who export pepperoncini lardo to Japan for sushi ) I had Swiss make some jalapeno lardo I would have done pepperoncini but I ve not had American-made pepperoncini as good as the Italian stuff and Americans like hotter stuff like jalapeno so I decided to go for it with jalapeno lardo It was excellent The pepper gives the product some heat Mangalitsa bellies Swiss Meat can cut Mangalitsa pigs the way they do in Austria as the photos show There were no Austrians in the room when they fabricated these parts It was an entirely American production People who buy our products and meat are helping to improve America 's culinary expertise one bite at a time - because that 's what pays for it all Mangalitsa hams ready for curing While we were there a guy who d bought some feeder pigs from me Harry Cope brought one in to have it killed and cut Austrian-style He specifically brought his pig to Swiss to get it done that way He could have gone somewhere closer but they couldn t cut his pigs that way If Wooly Pigs and Swiss hadn t taken pig butchery to the next level he d be stuck with wasteful Anglo-American butchery Mangalitsa shoulders ready for curing In a ition to getting hams to cure Harry will get shoulders de-ribbed bellies de-reribbed loins cur curing fatback for lardo fat for sausage soft fat for rendering and leaf fat for leaf lard Much of that product is going to Mark Sanfilippo - the same Mark Sanfilippo that the Wall St Journal wrote about along with Mangalitsa Lardo maker Rey Knight The fact that Cope / Sanfilippo will get 4 categories of fat - an entirely reasonable thing from a Mangalitsa - isn t normal in America but makes a lot of sense for a meat processor or a chef Mangalitsa sirloins Mangalitsa rib-loins So our first batch of lardo finished It was interesting to see how normal Missourians like the stuff It was very popular People immediately got that a little Mangalitsa lardo on a Ritz cracker or a Mangalitsa lardo sandwich on some sandwich bread is a fine snack Slicing it thin - as shown in the picture above - makes it more palatable to people and really stretches it I figure we ll have to sell it pre-sliced ( a bit like Kraft singles ) so that those without rotary slicers can enjoy thinly-sliced lardo Making lardo requires the butchers to separate the meat from the fat very carefully Gouges in the fat are undesired because salt will get trapped in it The goal is to cleanly separate the fat slab from the meat It is quite a challenge because the guy doing the cutting can t see inside the meat Last Fall Wooly Pigs sold a lot of Mangalitsa loins The loins had the fat on them Some chefs complained that the yields were too low To get the most out of the loin they needed to remove the fatback and cure it into lardo Looking back I can t believe that we expected them to do that How are they ever supposed to get any practice doing that sort of cutting and lardo making - especially considering that most American pigs don t have much fat on them and the fat they have is typically unsuitable for making cured products I can remember asking slaughterhouses in Washington and Idaho to separate the meat from the fat so that the fat could be processed The fact that we wanted special cutting was consistent with the special hogs ( very fat ugly and hairy ) - yet they weren t responsive to our needs The results were a lot of waste That 's why I 'm so happy about Swiss Meat - they ve taken this stuff seriously To my knowledge there 's no other slaughterhouse in the USA where you can bring in a pig ( Mangalitsa or otherwise ) get it killed and cut European-style and have them make lardo out of its backfat It won t surprise me if Swiss kills cuts and even processes meat-type hogs the way they process Mangalitsa pigs - because right now there 's no other USDA-inspected plant up to the task Torm Siverson of Pasture Prime Wagyu sent me photos of his first pig It is astonishingly fat Must be chefs - look at their shoes I got an email from Pasture Prime Wagyu 's Torm Siverson about the first pig they killed They non-butcher humans in the photo are some Florida chefs The carcass was around 200 It looks smaller to me in the photos Torm ( r ) looking at his work Given the coloring on the pig it wouldn t surprise me if it was the cutest piglet in this photo the little white piggy Edit Chef Windus wrote about this pig ( and Pasture Prime Wagyu ) on his blog He 's got more photos 
I 'm getting used to carlessness As Mark Twain once said Be carless in your dress if you will but keep a tidy soul Or something like that It 's all explained here Today the FTC announced that Lifelock and the Commission settled claims related to the company 's advertising The action may sound serious and of course the press loves to sensationalize these types of stories The truth however is far different than what the newspapers report Obviously I 'm biased but judge for yourself The FTC claims that Lifelock deceived the public by guaranteeing that it could protect consumers from identity theft even though Lifelock 's protection is not 100 % effective in preventing ID theft since it fails to stop fraud on existing credit card accounts According to Illinois state attorney Attorney General Lisa Madigan Unfortunately there 's nothing you can do or purchase that will protect you 100 percent from identity theft Madigan said Don t be scared into spending your hard earned money nbsp Now Lifelock has never claimed that it could prevent identity theft with 100 % efficacy What Lifelock has promised and delivered is a proactive identity theft protection service backed up by a guarantee that if the service fails ( as any security mechanism will at times do ) Lifelock will protect the subscriber 's time and money by contributing the legal / accounting / forensic work necessary to set the record straight And Lifelock 's guarantee is 100 % effective in protecting consumers from loss of time and money due to identity theft ( And no one even bothers filing claims about credit card fraud because the banks already cover those losses for the consumer ) And even if the FTC were right that Lifelock is not 100 % effective does that really mean that the service has no value -- that consumers shouldn t spend their hard-earned money on it That would mean that consumers should never buy ANY security product at all since nothing is 100 % effective Finally the FTC thought that Lifelock 's claims were too strong because we promised to prevent identity theft And yet prevention is the promise of most every security product on the market nbsp According to the Symantec Store Norton Internt Security nbsp prevents virus-infected emails and instant messages from spreading According to McAfee its Host Intrusion Prevention for Desktop product will prevent loss of confidential data by securing desktops from targeted attacks Experian ( when they re not selling your data ) also promises to prevent fraud This Google channel partner promises that Postini will Stop Spam Prevent Viruses The truth is that the FTC doesn t care whether consumers need protection from Lifelock 's ads The FTC has clear direction from President Obama to demonstrate its dominion over financial services as he campaigns to establish a consumer protection agency and so the FTC is prepared to enforce and potentially litigate even in cases they know they can t win Lifelock understood this and so even though 12 million is a LOT of money it 's nothing compared to what the lawyers will charge over the next 5 years to successfully defend against an FTC crusade I 'm proud of Lifelock 's success its team and its technology I 'm a happy subscriber along with 1 7 million other people I know of no better way to protect my family from identity theft than Lifelock lt -- Friday Afternoon Nathalie and I were really glad we had decided to stay to the end Saturday was a great day Benoit Mandelbrot Score 4 balloons I had so looked forward to hearing the inventor of fractals Unfortunately he did not deliver He sat back and reflected on all his work with a lot of jargon and an expectation that the audience was already familiar with chaos theory George Whitesides Score 6 balloons The Harvard chemist whose publications are the most cited in the field presented a talk on the two kinds of complexity -- emergent and stacked Emergent complexity arises out of systems with many simple parts interacting and a steady supply of energy ( the most prominent example is human life which emerged from the evolution of competing cells ) Stacked complexity -- like the internet -- emerges from exploiting predictably functional parts in systems with more and more layers of functionality ( e g transistors ICs computers networks ) This talk should have preceded Mandelbrot 's which might have then made more sense Sir Ken Robinson Score 10 balloons As with Raghava KK 's talk we d have never guessed beforehand from the speaker 's bio or the content that this TED talk would score 10 balloons But Sir Robinson whose recent book The Element presents his theories on education elocuted a summary of those ideas with compelling humor and wit His primary message is that educators should prioritize the campaign to help students identify and ignite their passions rather than pushing standard tedious work Philip Howard Score 5 balloons Phil Howard author of Life Without Lawyers delivered a rousing rally against litigators It was very well received ( way more than my 5 balloons would suggest ) but I think it lacked substance and instead merely tapped into mob psychology Phil provoked anger at trial lawyers by illustrating examples of trivial litigation But in my opinion he did not provide a balanced view -- even after cherry picking his examples I think that they crumbled beneath some critical thought For example his flagship example was a schoolteacher he met in the woods one day who complained that she was under legal pressure to reverse her late penalty on a particular student 's grade Furthermore when she wanted to drive two students to an extracurricular activity the school prohibited it because of The Lawyers insisting instead that they use a school bus Imagine that How shocking that parents will sue an earnest hard-working schoolmum for teaching discipline and prevent her from simply driving a couple of kids to a scholastic opportunity Those lawyers are OUT OF CONTROL I don t know the details of the schoolteacher 's case -- Howard did not share them But I do know that in most of these cases where parents seek legal advocates relating to grades the situation arose because the student -- usually a child on the autism spectrum -- has some learning difference that warrants accommodations in the classroom (s uch as extra time for homework ) These accommodations are exactly the kind that Temple Gardin and Ken Robinson prescribed to standing ovations not to mention that such accommodations are legally enforceable under federal law But sadly teachers who lack experience with learning disabilities sometimes see these accommodations as unfair co ling or inconvenient and choose to ignore them forcing the parents to either seek legal help or else watch their children unnecessarily fail at school As for the school bus I do not want teachers driving my kids around when a trained licensed school bus driver is available Do you I am all for legal reform but let 's approach it with balance and reason rather than pitchforks and nooses Anyway here 's the talk so you can decide for yourself Alan Siegel Score 9 balloons If by some chance this TED Member 's 3-minute talk makes it into a video watch it It was a very compelling description of how this guy makes the world better by simplifying complicated forms The world is too complex Alan complains with too much fine print But instead of organizing a posse like Philip Howard Alan does something practical -- he redesigns forms to be much simpler This kind of transparency is not only good for avoiding legal disputes but it 's also good for business The examples he showed were a clear streamlined one-page credit card agreement that every lender should use and the second was a streamlined easy-to-understand IRS form that will replace a gobbledygook 9-page notice that millions of taxpayers get today Adora Svitak Score 8 balloons Incredibly impressive 12 year old girl talks about her views on education The content is secondary -- her charm confidence and eloquence are eery John Kasaona Score 9 balloons For many decades in John 's homeland Namibia the local poachers like John 's father were prohibited from the wild game preserves (\ This Land For Use Only By White Persons read the signs ) at the punishment of death But the locals had lived alongside the wildlife for millennia sharing a sustainable ecosystem Under white rule the game was hunted for trophy and profit and the animals dwindled to the point where only 20 lions remained in northwest Namibia Finally the Prime Minister overruled the colonialists and charged the local poachers with protecting the wildlife John 's father and later John were among the newly deputized conservators According to John they succeeded in restoring the animal populations with 60 conservancies now operating across the nation The program is funded by the newly enabled tourism with surplus profits funding a thriving new school system The call to action here was to learn from Namibia 's example of how important it is to support the local human populations when trying to conserve ecosystems James Cameron Score 8 balloons The director of blockbuster films like Titanic and Avatar shared some great stories about his life and motivations James described his younger self as an introverted sci-fi nerd who for lack of access to space resolved to learn scuba diving after seeing such alien life forms on the Jacques Cousteau programs This was the inspiration for The Abyss the first film to feature a character completely rendered by computer graphics Cameron also confessed that he agreed to direct Titanic solely because he knew he could thus compel the studio to send him down to tour the real thing which he did in a Russian submersible It was on that trip as he remotely controlled a video robot through the wreckage that he first became interested in virtual agents and avatars Cameron 's message was that the most important ingredient for success -- at least in bu ing filmmakers -- is imagination And that 's what the world needs now lt = Friday Morning Saturday Morning = gt Friday afternoon and evening were packed with official TED talks TED member talks (3 minutes on stage ) and entertainment I ll cover the major stuff here but there were too many short format talks to cover them all Raghava KK Score 10 balloons This was the best full TED talk of the day-- a Slumdog Millionaire tale of an Indian cartoonist 's coming of age The delivery was masterful and funny Watch it now Denis Duton Score 3 balloons Duton is a philosophy professor from New Zealand The intriguing thesis of his book The Art Instinct is that appreciation for beauty is an evolutionary adaptation -- that we naturally find beauty in things and scenes that support our survival or reproduction For example he claims that people naturally prefer landscapes where the trees have low lying branches -- the better for escaping predators Unfortunately his delivery was not up to TED standards Marion Bantjes Score 1 balloon A totally self-absorbed artist shares her doodles Okay so lots of folks liked her and I 'm just a Philistine Still ick Temple Grandin Score 7 balloons An autistic woman whose autobiography is the subject of an upcoming film presented her position on education Temple has turned her intuitive understanding of animal cognition into a successful career improving slaughterhouses and now she 's preaching the importance of reforming education to accommodate learning differences Amen Specifically for kids on the autistic spectrum schools should integrate mentorships hands-on activities and on-the-job internships so that Asperger 's kids can one day make their way to Silicon Valley David Rockwell Score 4 balloons Architect designs innovative playground for kids Crowd goes wild with sentiment David Byrne Thomas Dolby and Ethel Quartet Some great music to ease us in after the break Natalie Merchant Score 9 balloons Even after David Byrne Robert Gupta and Sheryl Crowe the best musical show of the week was Nathalie Merchant 's performance of the classic poems she has put to music in her upcoming album Leave Your Sleep Here 's a nice one The Janitor 's Boy Nathalia Crane (1913-1998) Oh I 'm in love with the janitor 's boy And the janitor 's boy loves me He 's going to hunt for a desert isle In our geography A desert isle with spicy trees Somewhere near Sheepshead Bay A right nice place just fit for two Where we can live alway Oh I 'm in love with the janitor 's boy He 's busy as he can be And down in the cellar he 's making a raft Out of an old settee He ll carry me off I know that he will For his hair is exceedingly red And the only thing that occurs to me Is to dutifully shiver in bed The day that we sail I shall leave this brief note For my parents I hate to annoy :\ I have flown away to an isle in the bay With the janitor 's red-haired boy Julia Sweeney Score 10 balloons Julia Sweeney aka Pat from SNL is my heroine for writing and performing her theatrical production Letting Go of God ( which you can see on Showtime next week ) In an impromptu 3-minute talk Julia hopped on stage and recounted the birds-and-bees conversation she just had with her daughter It was hysterical -- if this makes it into a TED video watch it Meanwhile you can check out her debut TED Talk from 2006 Eve Ensler Score 9 balloons The woman behind The Vagina Monologues presented an outstanding reading from her new book I Am An Emotional Creature The Secret Lives of Girls Around the World We heard the tales of two young women -- one in an Asian sweat shop and one who was kidnapped by soldiers in Africa Again if this makes it onto video watch it Sarah Silverman Score 4 balloons Silverman performed a stand-up shtick with shock comedy that became the subject of much controversy when Chris Anderson himself tweeted how god-awful she was Later he deleted the tweet and apologized for sending it but also apologized to TED for bringing Sarah in the first place Silverman 's supportive bloggers insist that she was simply shaking up the establishment sticking it to The Man by using the word retarded Now I 'm all for shock comedy and so I laughed hard at her jokes about poop hot sex and Jews -- for the most part she met my high expectations But when she mocked dying retarded kids she lost me and most of the room Less polite audiences would have booed off her the stage but TED still applauded Now I ll never criticize a comic for making folks uncomfortable or offending sensibilities but Silverman hurt a lot of parents in there and ( maybe even worse ) the joke just wasn t funny The controversy has fanned many anti-TED flames in the blogosphere some of which I 'm bound to attract because I admit I didn t laugh at one of Sarah 's jokes Apparently the detractors find TED to be elitist and self-important we at TED don t produce fresh enough ideas we take ourselves too seriously and we re too crusty to get Silverman 's sophisticated form of parody The o thing is that I only hear this from people who didn t attend TED Really who has time for this The Party As usual TED hosted a Grand Party on that last night which was okay ( chilly crowded and short on food ) But the REAL party erupted unplanned in the lobby of the Westin where Jake the Uke player held court among those of us who speculated that there just might be a repeat of last year 's Westin lobby sing-a-long As the hours passed TED performers of all kinds must have read their tweets and made their way over joining the impromptu jam session Robert Gupta of the LA Philharmonic the Ethel quartet Louis the flamenco guitarist Natalie Merchant soundtrack composer Carter Burwell on the piano and others joined the fray riffing off each other 's music and whipping up the crowd At the pinnacle of the party Harry Shum of LXD ( and the cast of Glee ) turned the lobby into a dance spectacle ( check out the video below ) This performance won t make it into a TED Talk video but if you want to see it I 'm betting that Friday Night at the Westin has now become a TED institution lt -- Thursday Afternoon Friday Afternoon -- gt John Underkoffler Score 7 balloons Fun demo of the hand-gesture UI developed at MIT Media Labs that Tom Cruise used in Minority Report Blaise Aguera y Arcas Score 8 balloons Very cool demo of Microsoft technology that synthesizes photos in the public domain stitching together a navigable 3D virtual street view product ( without having to dispatch trucks everywhere ) Watch it for yourself Bill Gates Score 8 balloons BIll Gates gave a great talk on the landscape of choices facing us in the energy arena Since renewables are intermittent and all the batteries on Earth can store only 10 minutes worth of the world 's energy usage we need to make nuclear power work Tothat end Gates has funded Terrapower which aims to make fuel out of Uranium 235 which is far more abundant and safer than enriched Uranium 238 Sergey Brin Chris Anderson interviewed Sergey about Google 's changing posture toward China ( and you can watch it here ) Sergey responded openly about the difficulty of figuring out what is right to do as China enforces political censorship Some say I 'm naive That may well be true -- I wouldn t have started a search engine company in 1988 if I wasn t However Sergey wimpily dodged Chris question as to whether Google found evidence that China was behind the cyber attack Soon after a Googler came on stage to demonstrate the Nexus One which seemed uncharacteristically commercial for TED until the end when Chris announced that Sergey brought enough unlocked Nexus Ones for everyone Really Mike Feinberg and Dave Levin Score 7 balloons The co-founders of the Kipps charter schools led what can best be described as a pep rally for educational reform -- low on content and but high on volume and fun The Kipps schools target underprivileged neighborhoods and so far their 82 schools are delivering phenomenal results that have raised the high school and college graduation rates to be on par with national averages George Church Score 2 balloons This Harvard biologist touched on many interesting topics but did so incomprehensibly He defines life as replicated complexity and discussed his work synthesizing molecules that somehow 'm irror organic compounds but can t interact with the wild Gary Lauder In the best short-format TED Talk so far Gary Lauder reflects upon how we might organize traffic differently at a time when we care about carbon emissions lt --Thursday Morning Friday Morning -- gt David Byrne Score 5 balloons David Byrne of Talking Heads fame gave an interesting talk about the impact of spaces on music -- how the elements of different musical genres can be traced back to the spaces in which that music was performed or the technical capabilities of the delivery mechanism ( e g radio CD car boom box iPod ) He draws examples from Baroque Jazz Choral and other styles explaining they differ in their allowance of volume changes key changes held notes musical detail and other stylistic effects based on the acoustics of the cathedral palace room smokey bar or other venue Of course he also shared photos of his grungy basement where he and his bu ies first wrote and performed Nathan Mhyrvold Score 8 balloons To combat his reputation as patent troll the former Microsoft CTO talked about his company 's facility for invention such as an optical scanner that can detect malaria by illuminatng hemozoin ( waste from the malaria parasite ) or a container that can dispense vaccines but keep the remaining ones cool inside -- without power -- for up to 6 months But he brought his team 's most awesome invention to demonstrate on stage although it may not be the most practical intervention for African malaria it is surely the coolest a laser defense system from mosquitoes Mhyrvold 's machine which we got to examine up close later in the lobby was made purely of parts bought on eBay At one of the stage he placed a fish tank with mosquitoes flying around At the other end a good 20 yards away he placed his gizmo that tracks the mosquitoes through long range infra-red cameras extrapolates their motion in a computer and then illuminates them each as they fly with frickin laser beams To keep the demo going they used low energy levels so as not to burn the critters though of course that 's what the machine is built to do ( and Nathan brought videos of the buggers smoking up just to prove it works ) Even better they use two different color lasers to distinguish the genders so they could choose to kill only the infectious females ( I 'm guessing no one would mind if they killed all the mosquitoes but someone thought up a way to hear the difference and it was too cool a feature not to include ) Legion of Extraordinary Dancers I don t normally blog the entertainment but the LXD are superheroes Check them out Mark Roth Score 8 balloons Cancer researcher Mark Roth presented another candidate for the It-May-Not-Be-Pratical-But-It 's -Cool-As-Shit Award He and his team studies 'm etabolic flexibility the phenomenon observed in rare medical cases where people are dead for hours -- usually in frozen conditions -- and then revived when their bodies are warmed They hypothesized that our bodies may have some agent that can somehow lower our metabolism to the point where under distress we can do without oxygen for hours The concept of inducing suspended animation is not pure science fiction Human eggs survive up to 50 years inside ovaries and plant spores can survive up to 250 million years The number of cases where human beings returned from frozen death states with no heartbeat has inspired the saying You re not dead until you re warm and dead Some of those cases involved industrial accidents in which workers collapsed after exposure to hydrogen sulfide and were thought to be dead for hours until they were removed from the poisoned air and woke up Roth realized that we have trace amounts of hydrogen sulfide in our brains and so perhaps this is the mystery agent Early tests on rodents support the hypothesis successfully killing the specimens until they are removed from the hydrogen sulfide chambers So Roth 's team is now in clinical trials with a drug that would place trauma victims in suspended animation for hours until their wounds can be properly treated Really Seth Berkley Score 6 balloons AIDS Researcher Seth Berkley presented some startling statistics on flu pandemics suggesting that we are likely to soon see another like the one in 1918 that killed 100 million people Berkley also presented some promising research on a new vaccine to fight AIDS He presented a great animation developed by XVIVO to illustrate the mechanism by which the memory cells that develop from vaccines can fight the AIDS infection Stephen Wolfram Score 8 balloons With Wolfram 's characteristic ego he launched his talk about the biggest idea of the century which is if I understood him computational complexity Wolfram has made his career studying emergent complexity as documented in his humbly titled volume A New Kind of Science At TED he presented three things an impressive demonstration of Wolfram Alpha his web-based front-end to a computational engine some background on mathematica his attempt to build a structured comprehensive computational engine and his simulation of physical models designed to suss out those that reflect reality ( I think he 's basically trying to find the grand unification theory of physics through trial and error ) Thursday Afternoon -- Thursday morning was a celebration of reason -- my favorite part of the program Michael Specter 8 ( out of 10 ) balloons Michael Specter is a New Yorker journalist who lambasted the anti-science movement He wrote the book Denialism How Irrational Thinking Hinders Scientific Progress Harms the Planet and Threatens Our Lives Belief in magic instead of science leads to disease and war With a passion befitting Christopher Hitchens he ripped apart the movements that oppose vaccination engineered foods and western medicine Science is NOT a company As a laymen he seemed to carry more credibility than those know-it-all scientists though he wasn t as eloquent as a Dawkins or a Harris In a 3-minute presentation Graham Hill ( founder of TreeHugger ) reflected on a question he had asked himself last year why couldn t he bring himself to be a vegetarian when it 's so much better for his health the animals and the planet 's climate I just couldn t imagine that THIS is the last burger I will ever eat So he became a Weekday Vegetarian -- an 80 /20 solution He gets most of the benefits of vegetarianism without feeling deprived Now I normally don t blog the 3 minute presentations but based on the hallway chatter here at TED his Weekday Veggie meme has spread very successfully In another 3-minute diversion Jim Daly taught us all about carnivorous plants like the Venus Fly Trap native to North Carolina These plants are quite beautiful and one of them is now the basis of medical ant-bacterial research it has a compound that kills its prey 's bacteria so that the bacteria can t digest the bug 's nutrients before the plant does Sam Harris 9 balloons For the first time I got to hear Sam Harris author of The End of Faith and Letter to a Christian Nation Sam 's talk today attacked the sacred cow belief that science has nothing to say about moral values Provocative and compelling he offered up some great examples of how relevant the scientific method is when grappling with serious moral issues of the day such as economic disparities pollution and women 's rights He challenged the ethos of cultural relativity -- some behaviors are simply wrong no matter where you grew up so we must overcome our fear of saying so Do we know enough to judge a father whose reaction to his daughter 's rape is to kill her He offered lots of examples Is it right to apply corporal punishment in school ( as endorsed by the law in 21 states ) Science can a ress this question by examining the well being and educational success of the children blessed with such discipline How did we convince ourselves that every culture has a point of view on morality worth considering The Taliban is ignorant on physics how is their ignorance on human well being any less obvious One example he offered was in my opinion a bad one Science can tell us he said whether it 's a good idea for people to believe that the evil eye is watching and punishing us for what we say about others He slipped here confusing belief and action we cannot select our beliefs based on what is good for society lest you invite a demand for theism despite the utter lack of evidence of for it simply because it tricks some people into being good on Sundays His conclusion It 's possible for entire cultures to care about the wrong things Just admitting this will transform our society we must converge on the most important questions about human life We must first admit that these questions have answers Nicholas Christakis Score 8 balloons Christakis is a Harvard professor of medicine and sociology and author of Connected He studies the properties of social networks such as friend counts centrality ( are you in the thick of the social graph or on the fringe ) and transitivity ( are your friends connected to each other ) In his talk he overlaid obesity as a property to analyze and learned that obesity clusters in the social graph If your friends are obese you are 45 % more likely to be obese yourself If your friends friends are obese you re 25 % more likely Why would obesity cluster Turns out that that are three reasons friends are exposed to the same bad food choices based on their environments friends encourage each other to make the same choices they make (\ Let 's have muffins and beer ) and people tend to befriend others like them Elizabeth Pisani Score 7 balloons Pisani is an epidemiologist who studies the spread of AIDS in Africa Her presentation centered on the hi en rationalities behind the choices people make that spread HIV -- kind of like behavioral healthcare From afar it 's easy to dismiss the intelligence and well being of junkies and prostitutes but a closer understanding of their circumstances yields clues as to why they share needles and engage in unprotected sex In Indonesia for example anyone stopped by the police with a needle will be arrested and imprisoned so a icts have no choice but to share Prostitutes in that country earn close to 10 per hour rather than the 30 cents they would other otherwise earn Pisani 's agenda is to encourage clean needle programs In the UK Australia and Netherlands where clean needles are available 3 % of heroin a icts are HIV + In New York Jakarta and Moscow where they are not available 50 % of heroin a icts are HIV + Pisani is particularly frustrated by the short-sighted moralistic arguments against the distribution of condoms and needles dismissing the notion that they encourage destructive behavior Pope Benedict if you re watching this TED talk I carry condoms and I NEVER get laid Valerie Plame Wilson Score 7 balloons Wilson is an outed CIA agent who worked covertly to stem the proliferation of nuclear weapons She explained why terrorism and accidents will likely lead to catastrophic nuclear explosions and the Global Zero movement to eliminate nuclear weapons altogether She showed a trailer of the film Countdown to Zero aired at Sundance and previewed by TED Thursday night Michael Sandel Score 7 balloons Sandel is the renowned and dynamic Harvard philosopher whom I was fortunate to have as my professor for Justice as an undergrad ( watch one of his lectures below ) To improve the quality of our public debates he prescribes raising the level of dialogue from the specific issue to a discussion of the fundamental philosophies that underlie the arguments The example he used was the controversy around Casey Martin 's use of a golf cart due to his disability and the application of Aristotle 's philosophy to the question (d espite Aristotle 's notoriously high golf handicap ) The TED talk was entertaining ( e g mocking Justice Scalia ) but it didn t tie together as well as the full lecture presented above and Sandel was too wimpy to broach the underlying theistic philosophies that underlie arguments against gay marriage stem cell therapy and women 's rights Christopher 'm oot Poole Score 6 balloons Founder of 4chan the immensely popular anonymous and often profane chat site The teenage Poole talks about his accidental fame and his commitment to preserving privacy on the internet Kevin Bales Score 8 balloons This sociology professor founded Free the Slaves a movement to liberate the 27 million people around the world currently enslaved Largely an unknown phenomenon slavery exists in many nations where for hte most part bandits kidnap impoverished men women and children often under the guise of legitimate employment I d have given this guy the TED Prize Stewart Brand Score 7 balloons Brand presented the merits of nuclear power followed by a spirited debate with Mark Jacobson Nuclear power is clean and doesn t require the huge land resource footprint of solar power (50 square miles per gigawatt ) or wind power (250 square miles per gigawatt--although he seems to have forgotten that wind farm land can still be used for agriculture ) The debate exposed a lot of numbers and costs and the answer really boils down to whether you think that nuclear power will inevitably lead to radioactive accidents or the use of nuclear weapons If so it 's an awful choice but if not then it 's a no-brainer The audience came into the discussion 75 % pro-nuclear and exited 65 % pro-nuclear Jane McGonigal Score 4 balloons Game designer Jane McGonigal asserts that the 3 billion hours per year of computer game play prepares children well for the challenges that face our species To win today 's games one must face daunting world-shaking challenges despite awful o 's overcome failure numerous times and innovate Nathalie and I topped off the morning enjoying a picnic lunch in the sunshine with Dan

Tribune Company Once a major broadcasting and publishing giant ( Chicago Tribune LA Times etc ) it is now crumbling like a sand castle And Michaels who in a similar role with Clear Channel Communication laid the groundwork for that empire to collapse So it 's understandable why Tribune would hire a non-newspaper man to oversee their operation in it 's most dire time Anyway recently he issued an edict to the news director of WGN radio listing 119 words or phrases WGN newscasters were no longer allowed to say WGN Chicago is one of the most respected radio stations in America I can

Phoenix is the land of bar food I don t think there 's a place in town that doesn t serve buffalo wings including sushi bars and vegan cafes There are also gift shops in every restaurant This is very strange to me But you can enjoy a hearty breakfast at the Cracker Barrel and still pick out that perfect we ing gift for sis We dined our first night at the Sa le Ranch Chop House What really sold us on the place was the décor They had a mechanical bull A attractive women and beers from many lands and there 's no greater entertainment in the west Suburban Cowboy For mi le-aged Jewish guys this was Hooters without the guilt The Chop House was just one of many fine establishments in the Westgate City Center It 's as if a developer said You know what would look good on this empty field in the mi

Wednesday I got to announce the Dodger game from their spring mecca Camelback Ranch It was seen on Prime Ticket in southern California and just my luck nationwide on the MLB network What a train wreck and by that I mean mostly me First off I still have an inflamed cornea so I really just have one good eye I was fine as long as no one hit a ball to left field I was counting on watching the monitor but because of the glare of the sun I couldn t see it They d be flashing starting line ups on the screen and I d be merrily talking about something else Eight years major league experience and viewers must ve thought I was there because I d won an auction Then someone batted out of turn Well to be more specific three players batted out of turn This never happens My daughter Annie said How could they screw that up Isn t baseball like the only thing they do So now I 'm on coast-to-coast TV completely confused Then all the substitutions began and it was like Lucy and Ethel at the candy factory and those chocolates just kept coming down the conveyor belt faster and faster I may have called a Diamondback pinch runner Diablo Cody I 'm not sure Steve Lyons my partner said in fourteen years of broadcasting this was the hardest game he 's ever had to call It was surely not my finest hour but still I had a blast Thanks again to Steve for never saying on the air What the hell are you talking about and the Dodgers for the chance I look forward to doing another game when runners pass each other on the base paths and a meteor lands on the field If you do come out for spring training make sure you catch a game at Camelback Tickets are affordable and new this year free parking Would you call that a fee nix That 's maybe the only stupid thing I didn t say during the telecast Happy Ho ur has two meanings in Phoenix The standard one ( that I took advantage of downing six drinks in rapid succession after the game ) and it 's also code for Early Bird Specials The old people who aren t filed away in Florida are in the Valley of the Sun And they love their early dinner specials So if you stop off at a local eatery looking to wet your whistle and order the Happy Hour special don t be surprised if they bring you boiled chicken But you don t have to be 80 to feel old Howard and I asked the young desk clerk at the hotel where might we go for a good breakfast ( and decorative soaps )

received The show next week was unprecedented Host Jackie Gleason just sat in a chair and well you ll have to see for yourself Jackie Gleason :\ You re in the Picture Uploaded by werquin - Discover more animation and arts videos Here are more Friday questions answered From rockfish Being in both writing and sports do you know why sports has rarely translated into a successfully popular TV show TV tends to shy away from sports-themed shows because they can be way expensive At some point you need to see the games and that requires crowds a lot of production and MONEY There have been some attempts but they tend to be too costly to justify their ratings The worse ever was a sitcom on CBS adapted from the Jim Bouton book BALL FOUR They did it as a multi-camera taped show all set in the locker room You never saw them play It was insane but cheap FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS proves you can make a great sports-themed show I just wish more people watched it And there have been others THE WHITE SHADOW for one I 'm sure you can come up with two or three more M Shawn wonders What exactly is the job of a Television Producer I know what a Director amp Writer does but I 'm ignorant to what a Producer does Unlike in features this is a hazy area In features a producer puts together the whole package finds or develops the material champions the project until the studio greenlights it hires the director and cast manages the budget and in some cases raises the financing In television the show runner acts as the overseer of the production and in most cases he is a writer But then there are the non-writing producers ( or pods ) Here 's where it gets real murky These are generally former network or studio executives who are given sweet production deals And studios are now forcing writer / producers to attach themselves to these pods because the studio is paying for these pods So in many cases these producers merely a another level of interference and take part of your profits for the privilege There 's nothing they do that the writer / producer couldn t do without them and has been doing without them very successfully for fifty years Executive Producer Tony Soprano And finally from YEKIMI What teacher did you love the most someone in grade school high school college or someone in the industry who may have taught you some things you would have never learned anywhere else The best teacher I ever had was a high school history teacher named David Solkovits He made the subject come alive and kindled an interest in history I have to this day Along the way I have been incredibly fortunate to learn the craft of comedy writing from Larry Gelbart (p ictured ) James L Brooks the Charles Brothers Tom Patchett amp Jay Tarses Gene Reynolds and Jerry Belson My directing gurus were James Burrows and David Lee There 's not a single English teacher I can point to in high school or college who really made a positive impact But there was a radio newsman named Bruce Anson who taught me more about writing than anyone else Here 's the post I once did about him What are you pondering these days Last week there was some grumbling that I didn t answer enough Friday questions So this week I 'm devoting two days to your questions More answered manana Jeff gets it started We are big Frasier fans but we just watch whatever show comes on cable I never read about Roz - although we like her character a lot Any stories there First off Peri Gilpin is the sweetest human being on the planet That has nothing to do with the story but I wanted to say it anyway One day during the first season after a runthrough I said she looked very comfortable behind that control board She said Well my dad was in radio Being an old radio guy myself I asked who he was She was sure I had never heard of him He died quite a few years ago Still I wanted to know Jim O Brien I was floored I did know Jim O Brien He was program director of KHJ in 1969 and I did an audio documentary for college on the station and spent a day interviewing him He was a great guy After KHJ he moved to Philadelphia where in a ition to radio he started doing TV weather He died tragically young in a sky diving accident saving a fellow diver whose chute didn t open One day on KHJ he filled in on the air and I happened to tape the show I dug up the tape it was an old musty reel-to-reel and gave it to Peri the next day I knew the sound department could figure a way for her to hear it She was very touched A couple of days later at runthrough she thanked me again and said it was the first time she had ever actually heard her father on the radio She was very little when he died I have other Peri stories but that 's my favorite Dan Brown asks What kind of priority was reality in your scripts How much emphasis was there in keeping things plausible My biggest pet peeve now with sitcoms is that even some good shows such as The Office defy believability The other night Dwight punched out Pam 's window and tore up the house with a sledgehammer when asked to retrieve an iPod Uh sure ) Even in comedy shouldn t writers ask themselves Would this really happen I can t speak for that OFFICE episode but personally I think it 's crucial to keep it real ( Jesus I sound like Randy Jackson ) On MASH we had medical advisers on-set nurses and military advisers just to make sure everything was plausible And on CHEERS we drank But the best comedy comes from reality If you can believe or better yet identify with behavior the better your chances of laughing Characters can act irrational crazy weird anything you want as long as it 's justified We joke about actors always needing to know their motivation but they do Rachel Roberts a wonderful actress on the old TONY RANDALL SHOW once said to us after a scene in rehearsal So what 's my motivation I 'm an out patient Yo dawg keep it real Know what I 'm sayin What 's your question I try to get to as many as I can Honest Really No I mean it So let 's switch gears from yesterday and baseball Spanning the dial to bring you the cheesiest in reality shows I have uncovered a gem Many thanks to my daughter Annie for turning me onto this little beauty RU PAUL S DRAG RACE on Logo Logo is the gay network although I think this show is even too gay for them RU PAUL S DRAG RACE follows your standard reality competition format with contestants put through various challenges and one getting eliminated every week Except they re all drag queens and the grand prize is 25 000 a P R firm 's services for a year and various and sundry drag queen gigs Not exactly life-changing but certainly enough to warrant these guys humiliating themselves on national television We get to meet the drag queens in and out of costume And we see Ru Paul not in drag That was a first for me Out of the wig and gowns he looks kinda like the villain in PRINCESS AND THE FROG The contestants all go by their drag queen names So Pandora 's Box is pitted against the likes of Jujubee Raven and Tatiana They live together in a house with big steel doors and exposed rivets on the wall I half-expected to see the Gimp from PULP FICTION chained to the floor Imagine my disappointment The first challenge was called the Queen is Right It was the Price is Right except with items drag queens would consider essentials So they had to guess the price of white tube socks pepper spray duct tape brass knuckles and a human hair wig These items were displayed by muscular male Chippendale-type models who were bare-chested except for neck ties The winner got to call his mother I swear I 'm not making this up Then they all had to play the Snatch Game Gene Rayburn is rolling over in his grave The queens were expected to impersonate a celebrity of their choice complete with costume and make up of course So they went as Carol Channing Beyonce Pink Lady Gaga Britney Spears Paris Hilton Whitney Houston ( the Bobby Brown Whitney not Clive Davis version ) and Ru Paul The 200 pound man who did Carol Channing was a riot and the guy who did Britney looked so authentic he could actually pass for Britney Spears until he got out of a car They had to answer Match Game type questions like Slutty Sally was so slutty when she rode on a disco stick she Everything about this show just screams class Then there was a runway competition One by one these bruisers came out in flamboyant ridiculous gowns cat suits and Jackie Kennedy outfits The bottom two were selected and to help Ru Paul make his final decision they had to Lip Sync For Your Life Cat woman stripped down to bra and panties and did cartwheels with such force the stage almost collapsed He proved to be the loser as Ru Paul delivered the soon to be famous catch-phrase Sashay away And my favorite moment this is what got me hooked Ru Paul asks one of the drag queens Where did you get your sense of humor from to which he replies My father passed away That 's it I 'm setting my DVR for a season pass right now RU PAUL S DRAG RACE For good delicious jaw dropping entertainment you gotta check it out Squirrel friends 
Last week Hard Assets Investor published another one of my articles In it I compared the correlations between several energy ETFs and the prices of commodities they are tracking The takeaway message is that for the most part ETFs do a bad job tracking commodities prices There are a few reasons for this The first and primary reason why the correlation is less than perfect is that the front-month futures contract for every commodity is constantly changing Since most ETFs hold only the front-month contract this means that sometime before expiration the fund must sell its holding of one (s oon to expire ) contract and then purchase another (s oon to be front-month ) contract There is almost always a significant discrepency between the two prices particularly if it 's a commodity that doesn t deliver every month Take a look at the futures chains on the CME group website for crude oil gold and corn As of writing the difference between the front month and second month contract is about 40 1 and 10 respectively That may not seem like much but that price difference represents a pure loss in the value of the fund with every roll that takes place Just to prevent declines the fund would on average have to be increasing in value between 1 and 5 % a month That means that depending on the commodity and the fund a monthly percentage increase if not sufficiently high may actually mean you re losing money The second problem with ETFs is that they create a secondary market on top of what is already a volatile market in its own right And while the underlying instruments are the same for both ( futures contracts ) the factors driving the supply and demand may be drastically different For example while natural gas might be moving up on strong demand resulting from a particular weather forecast if the primary participants are energy hedgers no such demand would exist for UNG the world 's biggest natural gas etf As such UNG might theoretically follow the price of gas with something of a lag rather than actually track the price in real time Don t take my word for it take a look at this graph comparing oil price movements with the price of USO the world 's biggest crude oil ETF over the last four years Click here to download Flash Player now View the full Crude vs USO chart at Wikinvest Now you might be saying those charts seem to follow each other reasonably well but that 's the problem Reasonably well isn t good enough An investor buying a share or shares in a commodity ETF that puportedly tracks the price of a commodity wants her investment to actually do just that not merely track the price reasonably well It 's true that there are some ETFs especially those dealing with precious metals that eliminate the problem of the roll yield altogether simply by buying and hoarding the commodity in question and storing it in a vault somewhere no futures contracts required While certainly effective in mitigating the problem this only works for a very specific subset of commodities that do not have a cliff for their usefulness Other than those few cases in general the moral is that if you really truly want exposure to commodities don t waste your time with an ETF As they stand very few of them can be relied upon to achieve their goals Though that may change in the future for now your best bet is get into the futures market directly Last week a couple of the major commodities exchanges announced the a ition of some new futures contracts to help producers and consumers of raw goods hedge their expenses and simultaneously give commodities traders three more reasons to develop stress-related ulcers First across the pond the world 's foremost metals market the London Metal Exchange ( LME ) yesterday opened trading of cobalt and molybdenum futures In shocking concordance with my previous post about the emerging need for a lithium futures contract the cobalt contract is designed specifically with battery manufacturers in mind cobalt being a major input to rechargeable batteries in things like laptops and cellphones Molybdenum which I had never heard of before this Wall Street Journal article is apparently used in the production of stainless steel Meanwhile here in the States the ever-growing Chicago Mercantile Exchange announced that it will be a ing a contract for distiller 's dried grain ( G ) a by-product of corn ethanol production This is interesting because with the a ition of the contract which will begin trading in April ethanol producers can now effectively hedge every step of their production For example before the harvest you might buy a corn contract so as to protect yourself from unexpected price swings at your local grain elevator Then once you ve got your corn and begin distilling ethanol you can sell both a G and ethanol contract to lock in prices for your two resultant byproducts Further you can buy or sell oil gas or natural gas contracts to take advantage of spread deviations between the fuels This is also interesting because the G contract may become a major hedge-staple for corporations that produce ethanol for non-fuel purposes you know like Jack Daniel 's The government and now the private markets are conspiring to make ethanol a real and viable energy source with plenty of economic safegaurds A bizarre reaction to these announcements is concern that opening these contracts to the public will increase volatility in the prices of the commodities and could potentially drive them too far one way or the other Yes that is true prices will become more volatile but only for the traders The hedgers (p eople producing and consuming ethanol ) actually need volatility to protect themselves from things like price-fixing and su en unexpected swings Without and open public market there 's no way to plan for and predict what G would and will cost Also hedgers are not entering and exiting positions over and over to make a quick buck they are locking prices in exiting positions and taking the difference as market protection As per my post last night and today 's news on housing starts I certainly ought to eat a little crow according to the Census Bureau January housing starts were up from December as well as January 2009 Specifically according to the Bureau 's report Privately-owned housing starts in January were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 591 000 This is 2 8 percent ( 11 5 %) above the revised December estimate of 575 000 and is 21 1 percent ( 12 3 %) above the January 2009 rate of 488 000 So yes it appears I was wrong with my initial assessment and the housing market indeed showed signs of picking up in January potentially contributing to the Lumber run-up of the last month However the actual meaning of the housing start increase is slightly more complicated than the above quoted numbers and I would make the case much less meaningful than reports are making it out to be Let me explain First regarding the meaning of the number itself the 2 8 % increase in housing starts is an increase in the seasonally adjusted housing start rate Because the US Housing market is highly seasonal ( i e more building projects begin in the spring and summer months ) examining trends on a purely month to month basis is not meaningful when analyzing long-term trends Housing starts will almost always go up in March and they will almost always go down in October As such the US Census Bureau developed a statistical method called X12 ( and its predecessor X11 ) used to remove the expected seasonal effects of this type of data The best article I could find describing the algorithm is o ly enough on an old Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas webpage but suffice to say the algorithm is designed to remove expected seasonal effects for a given data series thereby showing the actual overarching trend Thus the published number is a point estimate for what the current annual housing start rate is in this case 591 000 housing units started per year As with any statistical analysis there is a margin of error to that point estimate and the margin is given right in the reporting sentence This is 2 8 percent ( 11 5 %) above the revised December estimates Wait a minute 2 8 % 11 5 % That should give us a range of 8 7 % to +14 3 % and if I 'm not mistaken 8 7 0 14 3 As any statistician can tell you a confidence range that includes zero is not statistically significant at all And the Census Bureau uses a 90 % confidence interval in their calculations so it 's not as though they re being overly conservative with their estimates and confidence ranges In other words this number is fundamentally meaningless In fact if you actually bothered to read the report ( as apparently no one in the media did ) you d see that the 11 5 % figure is asterisked with a footnote that reads as follows :\ 90 % confidence interval includes zero The Census Bureau does not have sufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the actual change is different from zero So in other words there is no evidence that there was a change in the seasonally adjusted rate WHATSOEVER This number is meaningless Moving on despite the lack of evidence for a month over month change the increase in rate from January last to now does appear to be truly significant with a confidence interval of 21 1 percent 12 3 % ( between 8 8 % and 33 4 %) for the change from January 2009 's seasonally adjusted rate ( Note that that range does not cross zero ) The report also lists the raw housing start numbers ( those that haven t been seasonally adjusted ) Here are the highlights ( all numbers pulled from the aforementioned report ): 2008 Year in full 905 500 2009 Year in full 554 500 January 2009 31 900 November 2009 42 300 December 2009 37 100 January 2010 37 800 The takeaway from all of this is that the housing market has improved significantly since 2009 In fact using either the December or January estimate for the seasonally adjusted housing start rate yields a significant improvement over the 2009 total figure However there is not sufficient evidence to suggest that any further progress has been made over the last two or three months the numbers ( both seasonally adjusted and raw ) do not demonstrate sufficient statistical significance to draw that conclusion Starker still is that the market today remains at about 65 % of where it was in 2008 How did the Lumber market today respond to all this Somehow despite the hype prices moved mostly sideways either this information was already priced in or it doesn t really exist Full Disclosure As of writing author is short May 2010 Lumber ( LBK10 ) Today 's Wall Street Journal ran a great article on the recent surge in Lumber prices (T hough sadly the online version 's headline was changed from the print 's pun-tastic Builders Nailed by Lumber Prices to the infinitely more boring High Lumber Prices Threaten Housing Market ) The article does a fantastic job explaining the why 's behind the recent insane price movements in the lumber market which I have discussed at length in a previous post In that post I laid out my then somewhat limited understanding of the reasons for lumber 's price increase which the WSJ article largely confirms and significantly expands upon Basically here 's what happened Due to a dramatic falloff in demand largely the result of a depressed housing market lumber mills and loggers have significantly decreased production According to the WSJ article lumber output fell 45 % ( ) between 2005 and 2009 As the housing market remained stagnant lumber wholesalers saw no need to maintain large inventories throughout 2009 further disincentivizing output from loggers and mills Because of the lack of demand and low prices several lumber mills have indefinitely shuttered This of course in itself drove prices higher The article specifically mentions Canfor Corporation a Vancouver-based producer responsible for half a percent of total North American lumber output who indefinitely ceased operation on January 5th 2010 as one of the major mills to shut down amid the sluggish market Annually home builders restock their lumber supplies in January and February in anticipation of the upcoming spring building season As supply was already incredibly tight and production was being scaled back across the board wholesale buying triggered a supply shock up the chain sending prices higher A itionally some firms continued buying on anticipation of consumers taking advantage of the federal home-buying tax credit before it expires As the industry was not in any place to su enly ramp up production the market created something of a feedback loop driving prices higher from January through to today Exacerbating the problem is that shuttered / suspended mills do not have the capital ( or guarantee of near-term capital ) to quickly start up operations again What is perhaps most interesting about this is that everyone seems to be in agreement that the surge is entirely supply driven To the question of demand the article says the following :\ The supply crunch is striking because just a few years ago the North American lumber industry was able to supply enough wood to start more than two million homes a year That was nearly four times the pace of home starts in December In other words home-building demand hasn t simply petered out it 's fallen off 75 % and still the price goes up purely as supply stays tight But perhaps the most interesting quote in my mind anyway comes towards the end of the article in a discussion of near-term production prospects :\ The ongoing recession will keep production light said Matt Layman who called this the only sustained supply-driven rally he has seen in 30 years of trading lumber Thirty years is a long time and Mr Layman 's quote only serves to highlight just how strange this market rally seems on the surface My readers already know that I 'm bearish on Lumber but honestly everything about this rally seems crazy to me At least now we understand the circumstances that pushed prices high in the first place but for this kind of rally to be sustained I 'm just not sure what it would take short of a spectacular resurgence in the housing industry Tomorrow the US Census Bureau will announce the figures for January housing starts A slight bump will be good news for the lumber bulls a downtick could mean the beginning of the rally 's end I ll put a post up as soon as we see what happens and what it 's immediate effect may be Sorry about the dearth of posts lately but I ve been out of town Speaking of I just got back from a trip to beautiful Whitefish Montana If you re a skier and / or outdoor enthusiast I can t recommend the city highly enough On the train ride out there I ended up having dinner with a couple of Montanans who own and work a farm on the eastern edge of the state We got to talking and I asked them what they raise to which the response came from the husband :\ Durum wheat peas and chickpeas On hearing the word wheat my interest was piqued so I asked :\ I 'm curious do you ever use futures contracts to hedge your crops To which he jumped into a very long very interesting discussion about the commodities markets The short answer to my question was no because there is no durum wheat futures contract he doesn t really have the option to hedge in the commodities markets however he can often lock prices in advance with individually agreed upon forward agreements with grain purchasers though he admitted that this is not as useful as a true futures contract because there is less liquidity in the market If you can t deliver your full crop he said you d better have the cash Following this conversation the man 's wife asked me :\ How do you know so much about wheat I explained that I was a commodities investor and sometime analyst to which she sai dWow because you sound exactly like our son What does your son do He 's a wheat farmer The commodities markets have always fascinated me because in some sense it is one of the last pure markets in the country When you put a bid in for a commodity like wheat you re not betting on earnings reports or interest rates CEO scandals cash flow statement readjustments corporate lawsuits etc etc You are simply betting on the price of a bushel of wheat It is one of the few places in the world of business where the Montana Farmer and Wall Street Analyst are not just peers but equal experts and it is a market that is open to EVERYONE If that doesn t stir your inner capitalist I don t know what would By bearish of course I mean pessimistic In other words I expect the price to go down Here 's a chart of Lumber futures prices over the last month Click here to download Flash Player now View the full FUTURE LB00 chart at Wikinvest Of particular interest is the big upward movement starting on January 28th Between then and this last Friday lumber TWICE went up the session limit of 10 / thousand board feet ( mBF ) At the beginning of the month I was bearish on Lumber because I suspected housing starts have not actually increased whatsoever ( and at the time I took a short position only to be stopped out in accordance with my personal trading philosophy ) however now I am even more bearish because I don t think this pricing run up either makes sense or is in any way sustainable Quick background about the market the random length lumber futures contract ( what most people mean when they say lumber ) is used extensively by lumber industry participants that is timber harvesters and construction companies to hedge against erratic price movements in the cash market ( the price you get at your local mill on any given day ) The biggest factor affecting lumber prices is the US housing market When the housing market is booming lumber skyrockets When home construction is depressed so too the lumber market There is very little else driving lumber prices as most of the lumber we use is grown domestically we export almost none of it and what lumber we do import comes almost exclusively from Canada Now that that 's out of the way a recent article from Reuters basically comes to the following conclusions as to why the price has shot up There are fewer mills currently in operation ( many had closed down when the housing market dried up ) creating a minor supply shock in the cash market and sending prices up There is an expected increase in demand as the result of the approaching Spring building season A realtor survey 's howed pending home sales were up 1 % in December My reason for being bearish on Lumber right now is that I believe there is a logical fallacy at play in the market Follow me here on this treatise If the housing market picks up ( i e demand increases ) Lumber inventories ( i e supply ) should be pressured and may diminish If inventories stay the same or diminish The price should go up This is basic supply and demand but I ve made each bullet cascading to point out the conditional nature of how the market in theory responds The other way for the price to go up would be as follows If lumber inventories diminish ( i e supply decreases ) If the housing market moves sideways or picks up ( i e demand stays the same or increases ) The price should go up Note the difference between the two cases In the first demand is the driving conditional in the second supply Also note and this is what 's important that demand and demand alone has an effect on the other predictive variable in the equation That is to say when demand changes there is NECESSARILY an effect upon the supply (Y es I know it 's possible that demand has been perfectly predicted and supplies tailored to meet the expected demand but this is incredibly unlikely in a market based upon a fungible commodity such as Lumber ) When supply decreases on the other hand there is by no means any necessary or expected response in demand Demand could stay the same demand could increase demand could decrease There 's simply no way to know or even extrapolate based on supply alone What we have in the lumber market is the second scenario Supplies seem to be diminishing because of the drawdown in milling operations However that in and of itself in theory anyway should not cause the price to go up For that to happen we d need to see that demand has at least not diminished or at best has increased If this were the other way around if we knew that demand really was increasing we could infer that supply was likely to decline and the facts about the mill drawdowns would confirm this and we could say that yes indeed lumber prices ought to go up However we cannot say that demand for lumber is increasing we can only say that supply looks like it might be decreasing and there is at best a possibility that demand is on the rise depending on how much faith you put in a self-reported survey from an industry with a financial incentive to make itself look healthy As for the 's pring building season 'm entioned in the Reuters article it 's important to note that this is buying by retail lumber dealers in anticipation of the season This is not a construction company buying lumber to build a house Unless that lumber is actually used it will just sit on the shelf delaying future orders and a ing to the supply Of course we can talk about what a market should or shouldn t do in theory about what 's the right or wrong expected price movement based on any set of information but the truth is that a market cannot be right or wrong A market simply is Lumber is trading at over 270 / mBf because someone was willing to buy a contract at that price and someone was willing to sell However while the market itself cannot be wrong the participants in the market can be Extrapolating that supply is decreasing based on mill slow-down is an assumption and it can be incorrect Believing the housing market is picking up is an assumption and it too can be incorrect If two people a buyer and a seller have the same incorrect assumptions the price they agree on will force the market in a particular direction and this will happen regardless of the assumptions validity Now this buyer and this seller they might be right It might be the case that lumber supply is falling and that demand is picking back up but personally I don t think so I don t think the housing market is picking up and I don t think supplies are in any way close to depleted enough to cause a significant shortage Housing starts declined in December you can read the reports on the Random Lengths website ( a sort of trade-mag for the lumber industry ) do we have any reason beyond the above realtor survey to believe they have increased since Again maybe Maybe I 'm wrong about this it 's very possible but I simply don t see housing starts increasing enough to justify this price run up Again I could be wrong I could be dead wrong and the US housing market might be ready to explode and the decline in mill output might cause a serious supply shock but even so in closing let me drop a little perspective The last time lumber was consistently trading above 260 / mBF was May - August 2007 Between then and now it broke the 260 barrier only one other time August 2008 As I discussed in a prior post whatever the natural gas market is the other nine months of the year during the winter it 's an inverse thermometer for the Eastern seaboard Take a look at these natural gas headlines for the last month from the Wall Street Journal 1 /6/2010 - Cold Weather Heats up Natural Gas OJ Markets 1 /15/2010 - Natural Gas off 2 5 % Falls on Mild Forecast 1 /23/2010 - Chilly Forecasts Lift Natural Gas 1 /27/2010 - Natural Gas Falls on Milder Forecasts 2 /1/2010 - Elements Hold Down Natural Gas - 2 /2/2010 - Cold Weather Boosts Natural Gas Couple things to notice here the first is that the 1 /23 headline was modified from its original incarnation Cold Forecasts Warm Up Natural Gas Prices 's ometime between when I wrote my prior post and now In fact you can still see that headline as the page 's title So it 's good to see that someone over there is insisting on slightly more variety of diction even if the changes are occurring four or five days late The second and more important thing to notice are the functionally opposite headlines occurring 24 hours apart on 2 /1 and 2 /2 Anyone at all (s ay for example a professional commodities analyst ) could point to at least TWO prior headlines that month and say that the news of EITHER 2 /1 or 2 /2 supports her model of rising OR declining gas prices The volatility of these markets especially when the weather is your primary driver makes every session a significant one -In the print version of the 2 /1 article there was also a B-Roll shot of some dudes playing football in Washington DC with the caption :\ ICING THE KICKER Unusually warm weather was a boon for football players in Washington in November not so for those betting on gas Awesome That picture really helps me get a better understanding of the natural gas situation You couldn t have put a chart there or something ( NB Yes I appreciate the irony of making fun of a superfluous picture and then not showing said picture myself while discussing it but wsj com seems not be hosting it Apologies ) If you own stocks this week

Then go ahead and change the view so that you re looking at the price over one month I 'm not a geopolitician but from what I understand Greece Portugal and to a lesser extent Spain are all having terrible times restructuring their debt so much so in fact that investors are fleeing EU investment vehicles for the 's ecurity of American government bonds and the US Dollar The dollar in essence this week fed on the ballooning deficit of three EU nations and the fears they brought to investors The side effect here is falling commodities prices as gold copper and oil all declined significantly over the last few days thanks primarily to steady increases in the value of the dollar Gold for example is down about 60 from where it opened on Thursday I find this notable for three reasons The EU

suffers This would be the equivalent of a debt crisis at an Illinois community bank making the dollar worthless in Japan To what extent is Greece 's fiscal stability the business of other EU nations How beholden is Greece to EU nations helping it out of a jam Commodities prices are decreasing as a function of a strengthening dollar against the Euro specifically The dollar has been falling against the Yen all month while moving more or less sideways against the Loonie With all of the global trade that goes on I would not have expected a simple shift from European to American investments on its own to have that sizable an effect on commodities prices typically you d need the dollar to get stronger against EVERYTHING for this kind of pricing plummet Investors are fleeing Europe for the stability of the dollar That 's the US Dollar The currency of the nation with 10 % unemployment and interest rates of functionally 0 The nation with a 1 4 Trillion deficit The nation currently fighting two wars If the US economy is somehow the world 's safe-haven right now that does not bode well for the world 
This was the scene as we gathered together to meet in the Annual meeting of Des Moines Preceptory of Legion of Honor for DeMolay The meeting always takes place on March 18 and it is a great group of men who have been honored by the Order of DeMolay I am the Secretary -Treasurer of the group so I had to be there a little early I stopped and picked up my new suit on the way out to the Willow Creek Golf Club It was a good Iowa Pork Chop dinner and the meeting went very well When I got home I started a Facebook group for the Preceptory Miles in on my S * T list He pulled my Rosicrucian 's necktie off the table and chewed it in half I should have taken if off and put it on the rack Oh well he is just being a puppy And he is still a puppy Just a big one Then a real treat I got to watch the group Straight No Chaser on Iowa Public Television And that reminded me that I needed to make my pledge so I took care of that I support Iowa Public Television and Iowa Public Radio They enrich my life immeasurably I am tired so I think I shall close this The Jokes are ready and they will be posted at 7 00 AM Thanks for stopping by Hugs

Thank you for the great comments everyone has been leaving lately nbsp There have been some questions about my materials I use to draw or software to animate nbsp So I d like to answer some of them nbsp I animate in Flash for 2D and Maya for 3D with the exception of the occasional animation in After Effects or Nuke nbsp I almost always draw quick people observational sketches with a pen I have a nice Faber Castell S PITT pen nbsp If I 'm drawing from my imagination then I almost always use a medium-hard pencil nbsp H 's or F 's nbsp If I like the drawing I will sometimes refine it with a soft 4-6B pencil nbsp If I a color I usually scan in my drawing set the drawing layer ( in Photoshop or Illustrator ) to 'm ultiply blend mode and a color on layers below that This is an illustration I made for an insurance company a few years ago nbsp I was going through some old files and stumbled on it It seems to give the sense of busy which is what I am right now nbsp It 's an animated gif that I created in photoshop nbsp Basically you feed 5 or 6 versions of a drawing into photoshop and it loops them Last year while on vacation at one of the lakes in northern Indiana there was this young girl who would catch frogs every night with a flashlight and a bucket Not only could she catch them but she could also stun them by rubbing their bellies A couple of weekends ago I rode down to Venice Beach to draw nbsp I found a nice spot to sit and watch the graffiti guys working on the Art Wall The History Channel has some new programs we ve been enjoying at home nbsp Here are a couple of characters from Pawn Stars and Pickers After a long Christmas break the quest continues as I try to dust the cobwebs off Here are some people that held still long enough for me to draw them The highlight of the day was the guy wearing heels and carrying his wife 's purse I attended the CTN-X animation expo this weekend With all of the great panel discussions going on it was a perfect time to draw and watch the hand gestures of the different speakers it seems most people have similar hand / arm movements but the subtle differences in the tension in the fingers reveal the unique personalities They didn t broadcast the Colts game here on the west coast so I was stuck watching a couple of teams that I didn t have much interest in So I started drawing

Welcome to Grade 1 :\ Alright students what does an ichthyosaur look like nbsp They look like dolphins nbsp Whales like whales nbsp Yeah FISH nbsp SHAAARKS nbsp Ooo ooo Mr Bond oooo Yes Billy Miga nbsp They look like Miga nbsp YEAH MIGA nbsp MIGAMIGAMIGAAAAA Settle down CHILDREN CHILDREN Ugh Miga for the uninitiated was an Olympic mascot here in Vancouver - part bear and part orca nbsp I assume it is the orca that Billy the made-up child in this real-life situation is relating ichthyosaurs to nbsp Dolphins whales fish orca - ARE ichthyosaurs so similar nbsp Or like Miga more of a mix of creatures Or are we just imposing our understanding of extant animals upon extinct ones nbsp What did ichthyosaurs look like With these beautiful aquatic reptiles being the focus of ART Evolved 's next Gallery I thought we should begin discussing how exactly they should be reconstructed nbsp What are the current controversies palaeo-artists are dealing with when restoring ichthyosaurs from fossil to flesh Darren Naish ( at Tetrapod Zoology ) recently (S ept 2008 ) discussed a few of the assumptions we make when we think of what ichthyosaurs look like and how they behave nbsp Did they really have dorsal fins nbsp How much of our knowledge of ichthyosaur body shape was faked by unscrupulous preparators nbsp Most aquatic swimmers ( fish dolphins ) have a dorsal fin two pectoral fins and a powerful tail nbsp Why did ichthyosaurs retain their two hind-fins nbsp In an older article Naish ponders the question Did they use their pectoral fins and fly underwater nbsp There are also a few questions I d like to ask here confronting the traditional view about ichthyosaurs 1 ) Was their skin slick and smooth like a dolphin or bumpy and scaly like a monitor lizard 2 ) nbsp Did they eat only squid and ammonites 3 ) nbsp Did all genus of ichthyosaur reproduce through live birth 4 ) nbsp Did they partake in cannibalistic behavior 5 ) nbsp What did the huge Shonisaurs eat 6 ) nbsp Could I have ri en one 7 ) nbsp Isn t there an easier way to spell ichthyosaur nbsp Maybe with less h 's I am hoping that some of our readers might have some insight into the World of Ichthyosaurs nbsp Help us reconstruct more accurate creatures nbsp Speak up nbsp We won t bite much And to get our collective ichthyosaur brains working watch this They Might Be Giants Nine Bowls of Soup 's taring Mr Ichthyosaur Some fantastically modern artwork from 1959 Use the contents drop-down menu to go the the Where Evolution Stands Today article Check out the ads along the way I adore the way that evolution is embraced by this popular magazine and - yeah feel nostalgic Note cross-posted from my blog because this is just too cool nbsp When I say Therapod what pops into your mind nbsp A sharp-toothed fleet-footed flesh-eating monster of a dinosaur right nbsp Tyrannosaurs spinosaurs raptors But what about a squat tiny-headed long-necked plant-eater These plant-eating therapods are known to the world as Therizinosaurs - named 's cythe lizard on account of their abnormally large claws on their hands This family of dinosaurs (T herizinosauridae ) previously know as Segnosaurs has a strange and convoluted history of discovery with palaeontologists at times calling them turtle-like lizards prosauropods and carnivorous reptiles nbsp It wasn t until the discovery of similar genus in the 80 's and 90 's that Therizinosaurs were finally classified as advanced herviborous maniraptorian theropods Recreating an animal so recently reinterpreted takes skill research and time nbsp The wonderful results from this process are collected below - a Time Capsule full of Therizinosaurs recreated in glorious pencil paint and pixels nbsp To participate in this and future Time Capsules all you need to do is send your image to artevolved gmail com nbsp It 's not too late to join in the fun So without further ado welcome to ART Evolved 's Therizinosaur Gallery Click to enlarge them nbsp

Time Therizinosaurus a creature from Jim Henson 's The Dark Crystal by Sarah Snell-Pym I started off by looking at creatures I thought had similar features or habitat niches to the Therizinosaurs and then drew a 's hape outline from a skeletal representation p199 of Vertebrate Palaeontology 2nd Edition The creature seems to have had an identity crisis in the world of palaeontology but the most recent stuff I found suggested feathers and stiff hair type structures so that 's what I went with My actual aim was to build an evolution of Therizinosaurs in palaeontology of which this would be one of the end members nbsp Therizinosaur by Anthony Contoleon Therizinosaurus 2000 by David Tana An early attempt at reconstructing Therizinosaurus ( Late Cretaceous Period China ) using only pencil and

the Devil 's Postpile in California A Slap in the Face by Peter Bond A Therizinosaurus cheloniformis repells an attack by a passing Alioramus remotus on a floodplain in Mongolia 70-65 million years ago I wanted to illustrate one of the less-shown uses of those giant claws Hopefully the Alioramus can afford the facial reconstruction surgery Therizinosaurine by Peter Bond Maniraptors Therizinosauria by Albertonykus ( From shortest to longest Beipiaosaurus inexpecticus Falcarius utahensis and Therizinosaurus cheloniformis ) nbsp nbsp nbsp The therizinosaurs were a group of strange-looking maniraptors This caused a lot of confusion in the past For example some therizinosaurs ( then known as segnosaurs ) were thought to be prosauropods ( basically all the sauropodomorphs besides the giant four-legged sauropods ) It was a while before the segnosaurs and therizinosaurs were recognized as the same group within maniraptor theropods Therizinosaurs had gigantic claws but their tiny heads and teeth suggest they were plant eaters To be fair they aren t the only plant-eating theropods ( link ) but few other theropods show such extreme herbivory nbsp nbsp Therizinosaurus by Jared Needle From a 13 ( or 12 ) inch square of double MC tissue paper violet / orange nbsp nbsp Still in progress after two months It has literally been standing like that for a month straight before I photographed it today It 's obviously missing a head I ve gone through at least a dozen attempts over the last month and still have yet to design a satisfactory head ( I also haven t had time to work on it ) I am extremely happy with the rest of it It came out perfect It just needs a good head nbsp We hope you enjoyed that look at all things Therizinosaurs nbsp Great job everyone nbsp The new poll is up on the right sidebar so be sure to vote for July 's Time Capsule ( wouldn t you just LOVE to draw ferns Erm ) As for the next Gallery the winner of that poll is ICHTHYOSAURS So be sure to submit your Ichthyosaur by May 1st 2010 nbsp nbsp To participate in an ART Evolved Gallery send your art along with a title and a small description to artevolved gmail com We accept art from anybody and everybody It 's hard to believe that only a year ago this site was launched So much has happened in that time In actuality ART Evolved as a concept is a bit older then a year In December 2008 Peter and myself thought up the idea of a multi-artist p alaeo -art show However when we contacted potential participants about such a show every one of them thought there was enough interest to go a step further and create a proper blog So for the beginning months of 2009 in secret we put together and constructed ART Evolved for its official launch in March It was one year ago to this day that ART Evolved debuted and it has exceeded any of our original expectations We have been featured in a magazine been a blog of note on Google 's official Blogger site and most important of all hosted 6 highly successful Palaeo -art galleries So to celebrate this epic first year and to get in some palaeo -art on this big day we present this B-Day cake created by cake artisan Rhonwyn Vaudrey So happy blog day to ART Evolved its members and participates We also extend a big thank you to everyone who submitted artwork wrote posts or just visited the site for helping to contribute to this great start Of course it doesn t end here Look for an equally exciting second year right here on ART Evolved Just a couple more Therizinosaur Live Blogs to bring your attention too The new comers

Since my brain is still a bit foggy from the meds I 'm using to fight the phlegm-based-evil which attacked me this week I ll simply give you a rundown on what needs doing round these parts A List of Kid Games I Need To Review Birds Bugs and Beans Burg der 1000 Spiegel Click Clack Das Magische Labyrinth Enuk the Eskimo Feed the Kitty Gelini Nightlife A List of Other Games I Need To Review ( or at least comment extensively about ) A Brief History Of The World Adios Amigos Alea Iacta Est Burger Joint Ca h n Gun Live Dungeon Lords Fightball Aztecs vs The Dark Keltis Der Weg der Steine Marrakech Piece o Cake The Adventurers Tobago I 'm never quite sure what to expect from fiction by an author of Christian faith for every wonderful reading experience ( like Stephen Lawhead 's Celtic Crusades or C S Lewis Chronicles of Narnia ) there are numerous slogs through preachy amp cliched schlock ( Insert obligatory reference to the Left Behind books here ) It 's a little like Tim Burton films - you never know when an Edward Scissorhands is going to bloom amongst a field of weeds like Batman Returns and Planet of the Apes It helps of course when you trust the author as someone who appreciates story amp subtlety which is certainly true of Jeffery Overstreet As a long-time reader of his articles amp reviews at ChristianityTodayMovies com and his blog LookingCloser org I was excited to find his first book Through A Screen Darkly which is a series of essays on movie-going amp faith So when Mr Overstreet released the first book in The Auralia Thread series Auralia 's Colors I checked it out from the library amp felt really guilty about not reading it Yeah I know that wasn t the story I wanted to tell either but it 's the truth I 'm not sure what kept me from digging into the first novel - some of the reviews I d read made it sound artsy and I never managed to pick it up and get into it before I had to return it Fast forward a couple of years to the early part of 2010 when I agreed to blog / review Raven 's La er the third book in the series I quickly realized that I didn t want to read book 3 before I read the first two books So for the past couple of weeks I ve carted around The Auralia Thread books and read them whenever I could waiting for my boys at the park taking a break at work even squinting at them by the light of a bedside lamp Yes the books are that good It 's my assignment to review Raven 's La er a task which I 'm finding daunting I want to try amp paint a picture of the book ( and the series that leads up to it ) without spoiling the joy of discovery that comes from reading a fantasy series set in a new world I hope to get you to pick up Auralia 's Colors and find yourself swept up by Jeffery Overstreet 's beautifully crafted descriptions amp plotting leading inexorably to you buying all three books As I ve thought about how to do this I realized that The Auralia Thread reminds me of the TV series Lost No there 's not an airline crash or a smoke monster or even a four-toed statue but Mr Overstreet uses the same kind of cinematic style of storytelling to move his plot forward We get to see important moments from the viewpoints of different characters Hints are dropped amp questions are raised at o moments that pay off chapters ( or sometimes even books ) later The author much like the writers on Lost isn t afraid to kill off characters or radically alter their lives rather than simply pander to our desires for things to be tied up in a simplistic package And while the story has definite philosophical amp spiritual themes ( esp the relationship of art amp faith ) those themes don t seem to drive the plot Instead they flow out of the natural development of the characters and their lives Importantly for me this is NOT a Christian allegory Playing the who 's the Christ figure game with Christian-penned fantasy novels quickly grows tiresome and takes me out of the book and into theology debate 'm ode Jeffery Overstreet deftly avoids this while still dealing with questions about blind faith the relationship of art amp theology legalism amp freedom desire as the arbiter of truth and a plethora of other important themes I realize that writing about 's erious themes is likely to turn off some readers I wonder if my initial hesitation to read Auralia 's Colors has to do with other reviewers writing similar things Pleased give the story a chance let the wonder amp mystery of this fascinating fantasy world pull you in Some specific notes about Raven 's La er The prologue tells a story that I was sure would be the first half of the book ( based on what had gone before ) In other words Jeffery Overstreet managed to both fulfill my expectations and take the story in some wild new directions in just a few pages The book covers even more of The Expanse in vivid detail There 's a story ( told by Krawg ) that absolutely blew me away near the mi le of the book and the implications of what happens to that story speaks volumes about the way we deal with truth amp art in our culture Some key story lines are resolved here while others are advanced and left hanging thankfully there is at least one more book coming It 's probably no surprise that I recommend this book ( well the whole series ) heartily These are the times that try men 's souls Thomas Paine was actually talking about the American colonies fighting for independence from British rule but it 's the first quote that popped into my head when I thought about being a parent Parenting is hard For those of you who are parents this is not a surprise There are so many competing needs expectations amp dreams bouncing around in our brains both for our kids and for ourselves It 's a wonder anybody survives the 18 or so years it takes to raise a child let alone two or three kids (T hose of you with 4 + children are either saints of incredible patience or gluttons for punishment or both ) Some of us had great parenting models from our families that balanced wise discipline with gracious love We had families that showed interest in our lives amp hearts and encouraged us to make good choices regarding spiritual truth amp moral / ethical choices Others of us had families of origin that were replete with all sorts of dysfunctional behaviors verbal amp physical abuse neglect a ictions amp codependcy the list could go on amp on Either way it 's pretty common for parents to latch onto some kind of resource to act as a guide for their parenting - when you re tired amp frustrated amp overwhelmed it 's a lot easier to read a book and follow what it says This explains in earlier generations the popularity of Dr Spock amp his book Baby amp Child Care ( and no this isn t the live long amp prosper Spock btw ) and in the last few years the cultural impact of folks like Dr Phil and Dr Laura ( Interesting side observation we like to listen to people who sound like they are well-educated ) In Christian circles the go-to guy has been Dr James Dobson ( there is that doctor title again ) While I don t agree with every political crusade that Dr Dobson has undertaken I ve found his parenting books amp the materials he recommends to be helpful But there are more folks out there who have teaching ministries purporting to have THE Biblical way to parent your child ( ren ) most effectively Some of those ministries go beyond the bounds of what you can legitimately claim from Scripture to support their particular ( usually legalistic ) version of parenting Without going into major detail I want to refer you to a couple of sites that talk about two of these ministries The checkered history of Gary Ezzo and the variety of resources he has published ( including Babywise and Growing Kids God 's Way ) is worth a very careful look - Ezzo info does a great job of compiling articles amp responses The teaching that set me off to write this post comes from Michael amp Debi Pearl and their No Greater Joy ministry - TulipGirl 's blog has an excellent list of warnings amp critiques of what they teach and the horrific consequences For me any kind of useful parenting advice is going to lead me to balance grace amp truth to show both justice amp mercy to use discipline in order to build up the character of my boys rather than break their spirits It will not affirm my cultural preconceptions but instead inspire me to treat my family ( and esp my children ) as gifts entrusted to me amp my wife Good parenting techniques will not necessarily make my life easier In fact they will focus on helping me raise adults rather than control children When the advice goes the other way - and particularly when the advice purports to be God 's way - I need to call it what it is a lie You didn t know this All you have to do is watch read / watch the news to figure it out For example did you know that Avatar is the highest grossing film of all time Really - of course that means you don t take inflation into account or currency fluctuation or the premium charge that most theaters levy for watching films in 3-D and / or IMAX Nah math is magic remember If you can a up the numbers it 's A-OK Or another example this one a bit more serious Did you know that the current war in Iraq ( which on March 20th of this year will have lasted 7 years ) is longer than World War Two Granted that depends on when you count WW2 as starting See if you date it by American involvement it 's not quite 3 years amp 9 months from the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941 to the surrender of Japan in August 1945 The traditional start of the war however is September 1 1939 with the Nazi invasion of Poland ( which makes the war almost 6 years long ) and I would suggest that you could make a case for the starting date being the Japanese invasion of Manchuria (S eptember 13 1931 ) which means the war lasted 14 years But what really cheesed me off about NBC 's comparison of the Iraq War last week was the length comparison to WWII followed by a list of Americans killed amp wounded in Iraq In nearly 7 years of fighting amp occupation 4380 American soldiers have been killed and approximately 30 000 troops have been wounded Those are tough numbers - no one wants to see that kind of grief amp pain visited on families amp friends However NBC failed to provide context to those numbers particularly since they had JUST made the length comparison to the Second World War Over 400 000 US soldiers were killed during our involvement in WWII 670 000 plus were wounded In fact over 19 000 US troops were killed during the Battle of the Bulge which lasted just over 6 weeks Look I 'm not arguing for or against the Iraq War or the success of a 3D movie for that matter What drives me crazy is that by refusing to set our pronouncements in historical context we make decisions based on our visceral reaction rather than on good sense and that is exacerbated when we imply false comparisons of data OK I ll climb down off my soapbox amp start working on my sermon for this week now I posted a bit yesterday about my Annual Oscar Birdbath and so as promised the results Well I 'm a bit embarassed I won Not a commanding win mind you - I got sixteen correct ( out of 24 ) and FOUR 2nd place finishers each got fifteen correct They are Elizabeth Arneson ( oh-so-patient amp loving wife of Erik Arneson my friend who runs the About com / Board Games site ) Gigi Johnson ( who was nice to me back in high school amp not just because her sister amp I share the same birthday ) Margaret Kellar (1/4 of the much-missed Kellar clan her husband was our worship / youth pastor here at NewLife ) Susan Rozmiarek ( Ed amp Susan are gamers friends and -

it 's actually about pop culture amp science education but see if it doesn t apply equally well to ministry Neil deGrasse Tyson At the end I sai dJust by a show of hands how many among you do not own a television These are people who teach physics Half the hands went up I sai dOf those who remain who own a television how many of you don t watch it except maybe you put a movie on it Half the hands went up Which meant three-quarters of that audience had no access to the single greatest force on the thinking of the people who it is that they re trying to teach And I said to them you cannot call yourself an educator if you have no insights into the tangled mental pathways that exist in the people who you are trying to teach It 's not just a lesson plan you re handing people You ve got to get in the head and find out how they re going to misthink what it is you re saying You ve got to get in the head and find out what excites them to care about what it is you re saying And if you don t you re just simply lecturing You re not an educator you re a lecturer and they either get it or they don t If that 's what you are fine but don t pretend you re anything else So the average kid watches 30 hours of TV a week You should at least know what it is I 'm not saying watch it every night But if there 's a hit show know what the hit show is Take a minute watch American Idol Watch NOVA Watch the movie of the week Watch the football game Watch Janet Jackson 's left breast Find out what people are talking about Because that will matter to them whether or not it matters to you You know something You re not the subject of that class -- they are Not all television programming lends itself to that analysis but nonetheless there could have been an episode that had an interesting twist a plot that you can tap In fact I view those tools as features on the utility belt that I carry with me every day I ll call that my cultural utility belt And therein I think should be the tool kit of the educator Little bit of pop culture little bit of sports little bit of politics little bit of everything that 's not in your field because it 's going to be in everybody else 's portfolio of interests It allows you to go places undreamt of if all you did was speak to the line-by-line notes of your curriculum Read the whole thing at Why Educators Need A Cultural Utility Belt 44 years ago today John Lennon opened his mouth during a magazine interview in England and this is what tumbled out Christianity will go It will vanish and shrink I needn t argue about that I 'm right and I ll be proved right We re more popular than Jesus now I don t know which will go first rock n roll or Christianity Jesus was all right but his disciples were thick and ordinary It 's them twisting it that ruins it for me A few months later the American magazine Datebook reprinted the quote and things went a bit nuts There were record burnings death threats and even the KKK got involved By the way important safety tip you can figure out when you ve probably gone off the deep end in your reactions when the Ku Klux Klan agrees with you (Y ou can read more details about it on Wikipedia ) Lennon I suppose if I had said television was more popular than Jesus I would have gotten away with it but I just happened to be talking to a friend and I used the words Beatles as a remote thing not as what I think - as Beatles as those other Beatles like other people see us I just said they are having more influence on kids and things than anything else including Jesus But I said it in that way which is the wrong way Reporter Some teenagers have repeated your statements - I like the Beatles more than Jesus Christ What do you think about that Lennon Well originally I pointed out that fact in reference to England That we meant more to kids than Jesus did or religion at that time I wasn t knocking it or putting it down I was just saying it as a fact and it 's true more for England than here I 'm not saying that we re better or greater or comparing us with Jesus Christ as a person or God as a thing or whatever it is I just said what I said and it was wrong Or it was taken wrong And now it 's all this Reporter But are you prepared to apologise Lennon I wasn t saying whatever they re saying I was saying I 'm sorry I said it really I never meant it to be a lousy anti-religious thing I apologise if that will make you happy I still don t know quite what I ve done I ve tried to tell you what I did do but if you want me to apologise if that will make you happy then OK I 'm sorry So this morning my friend game designer Stephen Glenn decided to use his Facebook status update to mock the Beatles tune All You Need Is Love - and then I commented about the anniversary and we were off to the races Let 's say for sake of argument that at any given time the Beatles -were- more popular than Jesus In the big False American Idol contest Jesus comes in third behind money and The Beatles Why would that even matter to someone who had chosen to dedicate their life to Christ Are they so insecure and threatened if someone / thing happens to be more popular than their guy First ouch Score one point for the snarky game designer with the Spiel des Jahres nomination under his belt Biblically Jesus was a 'm an of no reputation ( Philippians 2 7 ) and despised amp rejected by men ( Isaiah 53 ) so I must humbly admit that you Stephen Glenn are correct So I didn t use it in a sermon - though that may still happen It became a blog post (S tephen graciously OK d my use of this so I didn t have to steal amp therefore missed breaking a commandment tonight - thanks dude ) Look if Jesus really was a man of no reputation - a guy who managed to cheese off both the government amp the religious leadership - why are we who call ourselves followers of Christ so concerned about polishing his image Isn t the objective to be more like Him rather than to make the world like Him And if that 's our goal our vision our pot of gold at the end of the proverbial rainbow why do we waste so much of our time amp energy trying to force other people to pay respect to God like we were some kind of enforcers for a spiritual mob boss or a ministers of protocol to some tinpot dictator If God doesn t care that much about his Q rating why should we I ll let singer / songwriter Rick Elias have the last word (s) with his song Man of No Reputation It was said this man was of no reputation Yet He could stop the rising storm With a gesture of His hand But He chose to use His hands to heal Hearts of darkness hearts of stone Just like mine would be revealed He was a man of no reputation And by the wise considered a fool When He spoke about faith and forgiveness In a time when the strongest arms ruled But this man of no reputation Loved the weak with relentless affection And He loved all those poor in spirit just as they were He was a man of no reputation It was said this man brought only confusion That He d achieve his ends by any means And the truth that it brings revolution And for once they were right The truth set us free The hearts of the captive were his only concern And the powerful knew their days were ending One day soon the gates of heaven will open wide And the Prince of Peace will come back for His bride But for now we live on these streets Forbi ing and tough Where push always comes to shove And it 's said love 's never enough Where a prophet in rags gives hope to a fearful world No injustice no heart of darkness Will keep this voice from being heard He was a man of no reputation And by the wise considered a fool When He spoke about faith and forgiveness In a time when the strongest arms ruled But this man of no reputation Loves us all with relentless affection And He loves all those poor in spirit come as you are 
This article written by Jonathan Hartley was originally published in the Python Magazine Acceptance Testing NET Applications using IronPython Unit tests demonstrate to developers that individual functions and classes work as expected Acceptance tests are an orthogonal complement to this They verify to everybody including managers and clients that features they understand and care about are completed and working correctly They also prove that the system as a whole is correctly integrated and that no regressions have occurred Resolver Systems is developing a NET desktop spreadsheet application Resolver One for which we have accumulated an acceptance testing framework This framework uses Python 's standard unittest module and is executed using IronPython While Resolver One is written in IronPython this technique allows IronPython tests to interact with product code written in any NET language This article describes the principles of this IronPython acceptance testing framework and demonstrates them by creating an acceptance test for a small sample C GUI application March 9th ( that 's tomorrow at the time of typing ) IronPython in Action is the Manning deal of the

Logging A nascent project to Port Log (4 5 ) J from Java to C with the goal of usefulness in Silverlight especially for IronPython A WPF Picture Viewer NotifyIcon to use from IronPython nbsp Two Japanese blog entries both by sasakima-nao As with previous entries the code examples are very readable The first is a simple WPF picture viewer ( nice penguins ) and the second shows how to create a NotifyIcon and ContextMenu in the taskbar ( with Windows Forms classes ) Python-Ruby ( and a little bit of soap ) This blog entry is in Russian but I think there are enough code examples for it to be useful for those of us who don t speak Russian As I ve mentioned before the promise of the Dynamic Language Runtime is that dynamic languages can interoperate and share libraries This is exactly what this blog entry shows using the Ruby soap / wsdlDriver from Python The cool thing is that this is done with a helper / wrapper library that looks like it could be used to expose virtually any Ruby module / class that can be accessed through IronRuby to IronPython Using his ruby module the code looks like this from ruby import _import_ get_class _import_ (\ 's oap / wsdlDriver ) Soap = get_class (\ SOAP ::W SDLDriverFactory ) client = Soap (\ http // localhost1 / Service1 asmx WSDL ) create_rpc_driver () client HelloWorld ( None ) I ve Been Bitten By IronPython Marcus McElhaney has discovered IronPython and likes it The reasons he gives are 1 I can very easy use everything I know about the Net Framework VB Net and nbsp C 2 I can run IronPython in Visual Studio 3 I can reference ESRI 's nbsp ArcObjects libraries in nbsp Visual Studio and IronPython What 's even more gratifying is that he has been exploring IronPython through IronPython in Action and likes that too A slight misspelling gives rise to my favourite quote about IronPython in Action IronPython In Action is probably the best Python book I have ever pickled up because it also explains a lot of not just Python but also about Net If any book deserved to be pickled up this is it Have a great 2010 My belief is that the answer to the question in the title of this entry is an emphatic yes Microsoft have poured a lot of money into IronPython IronRuby and the Dynamic Language Runtime and have demonstrated a consistent commitment since the inception of IronPython What they haven t done is build full support into their premier development tool Visual Studio The reason for this is that it is a very difficult problem Visual Studio is built around statically typed languages Features like intellisense refactoring and code navigation all rely on having type information which is absent in languages like Python and Ruby (T he way they are implemented in Visual Studio requires that information I mean ) What Microsoft have done is provide example integration in the form of IronPython Studio which frankly sucks Many important features are fragile broken or missing altogether Good IDEs like PyDev and Wing do provide these features so it is definitely possible - it just requires a lot of work from scratch Microsoft have however a ed intellisense for Javascript particularly for jQuery into Visual Studio Javascript is of course a dynamic language but without having tried the integration I can t tell you how well it compares to using a good Python IDE I believe that Microsoft would like to a support for dynamic languages to Visual Studio and that it will come eventually Really they have a lot to lose by not doing it Now they have a good platform for dynamic developers to use which they give away free but the tools they charge for don t really support them This puts them in a position of either bringing developers to their platform but not being able to make any money or having their existing developers stay with their platform but losing dependence on the toolset Neither option looks much good for Microsoft ( NOTE for those who can t wait for official Microsoft support and have Visual Studio 2010 try Jeff Hardy 's IronPython for Visual Studio Extensions ) Anyway K Scott Allen sees things a little differently and I understand his frustration Is Microsoft taking Dynamic Languages Seriously Consider this IronPython got underway in July of 2004 Five years later it appears IronPython is still not a candidate to be a first class language in the NET framework and tools You can vote on this issue Microsoft first released IronRuby at Mix in 2007 Nearly three years later it appears IronRuby is still not a candidate to be a first class language in the NET framework and tools You can vote on this issue A first class language is deployed when the full NET framework is installed It 's as easy to find as csc exe It 's not a language you have to ask the IT department to install separately It 's not a language that requires you to jump out of Visual Studio to edit or run Most of all a first class language doesn t require justification to higher powers A first class language is pre-certified and stamped with a seal of approval It 's as easy to use in the locked-down big corporate setting as the company paper shre er Of course here we are talking about Microsoft as if it was a single entity with a single intention The reality of course is that Microsoft is a huge company with many divisions and even more individuals working there In all likelihood the vast majority of Microsoft employees have never heard of IronPython The relevant division is the programming languages group which includes Visual Studio development and where the majority of employees who are developers probably have heard of IronPython if not actually used it A ing official dynamic languages support to Visual Studio would require substantial investment of time and effort so even if everyone in this department was determined to a support it would still be dependent on forces from other parts of the company who have other needs and priorities Ironclad is a compatibility layer that allows you to use Python C extensions with IronPython Ironclad is open source and development has been funded by Resolver Systems and it is integrated into Resolver One to allow you to use Numpy within Resolver One spreadsheets Ironclad works by implementing the Python C API in a combination of C C and Python Although Ironclad only works on 32 bit Windows at the moment the implementation has been done in such a way that porting it to run on other platforms ( with Mono ) and 64 bit would be relatively easy Patches welcomed Recent development has changed the implementation to use gcc-xml to access and transform the Python C source code By reusing as much of the original implementation as possible it minimizes the amount that needs to be hand-coded It leaves only a ( moderately ) small core that would need to be reimplemented if Jython PyPy ( or other implementations ) wanted to reuse Ironclad The C would need to be re-coded in Java or RPython using the platform 's native FFI instead of PInvoke on NET The advantage of reusing Ironclad is that difficult problems like handling the Global Interpreter Lock and matching reference counting to different garbage collection strategies are already solved ( well for some value of solved ) Anyway that is all by way of introduction William Reade core developer of Ironclad has just announced Ironclad 2 6 RC This is a release candidate of Ironclad targeting IronPython 2 6 Ironclad 2 6 0rc1 released I 'm very happy to announce the latest release ( candidate ) of Ironclad the 120-proof home-brewed CPython compatibility layer now available for IronPython 2 6 No longer need NET pythonistas toil thanklessly without the benefits of bz2 csv numpy and scipy with a simple import ironclad ( most parts of ) the above packages -- and many more -- will transparently Just Work Get the package from nbsp nbsp nbsp http // code google com / p / ironclad / and get support from nbsp nbsp nbsp http // groups google com / group / c-extensions-for-ironpython or just ask me directly I 'm very keen to hear your experiences both positive and negative I haven t been able to test it on as many machines as I have in the past so your feedback is especially important this time round- Cheers William - I d be especially grateful if someone with a newish multicore machine would run the numpy and scipy test scripts ( included in the source distrbution ) a few times to check for consistent results and absence of weird crashes if someone volunteers I ll help however I can William has recently started blogging I recommend browsing the few entries he has already posted particularly this rant on static typing and this post on NET marshalling but his latest is of particular interest Spare batteries for IronPython As we all know Python comes with batteries included in the form of a rich standard library and on top of this there are many awesome and liberally-licensed packages just an easy_install away IronPython of course includes -most- of the CPython standard library but if you re a heavy user you might have noticed a few minor holes in the course of my work on Ironclad I certainly have Happily for you I can vaguely remember what I did in the course of bodging them closed with cow manure and chewing gum here then for your edification and delectation is my personal recipe for a delicious reduced-hassle IronPython install with access to the best and brightest offered by CPython on win32 More IronPython and DLR related projects articles and news from around the web Embe ed IronRuby and IronPython in Silverlight

scripting to applications that run in the browser slimtune A free profiling and performance tuning tool for NET applications IronPython 2 6 has useful new hooks for profiling and debugging IronPython code Unfortunately most 's tandard NET tools don t know how to use these and if you attempt to profile IronPython code (p articularly in an embe ed environment ) you have to work hard to get useful information about performance of your Python code It 's nice to see a new ( and open source ) tool that is designed to work with IronPython SlimTune is a free profiler and performance analysis / tuning tool for NET based applications including C VB NET IronPython and more It provides many powerful features such as remote profiling real time results multiple plugin-based visualizations and much more The source code is available under the terms of the MIT License SlimTune is currently in the prototyping phase of development but a preview release is available for testing and feedback is welcome Both x86 and x64 targets are supported but only sampling based profiling is available in the release Future of Managed JScript When IronPython 2 and the Dynamic Language Runtime were announced one of the three Microsoft developed languages that ran on the DLR was JScript Managed JScript was an implementation of ECMAScript ( otherwise known as Javascript ) and touted as a useful bridge for porting traditional-ajax applications to run on Silverlight Unfortunately as the DLR evolved JScript languished and there was no official word on its fate In this post on the DLR Codeplex forum Bill Chiles (D LR Program Manager ) gives the bad news The DLR JScript was experimental for informing the design of the DLR ( expression trees interop callsites hosting etc ) nbsp The JS we released with asp futures and the Silverlight dynamic sdk became very old and unserviceable as the DLR continued evolving for release in CLR 4 0 nbsp Unfortunately there are no plans at this time to develop and release a DLR-hostable JScript IronPython SHGetFileInfoW is ctypes A Japanese blog entry showing example code using the new implementation of ctypes in IronPython 2 6 ctypes is the Python FFI and in IronPython it is built on top of PInvoke the NET FFI ctypes is used for calling into native code like the Win32 API Calls SHGetFileInfoW which Retrieves information about an object in the file system such as a file folder directory or drive root IronPython on deviantART No idea what this has to do with the implementation of Python for NET but IronPython is the username of someone on the alternative community art site deviantART Some pretty nice computer generated art and who knows - maybe they were created from Python IronPython and the Dynamic Language Runtime make it almost ridiculously easy to a scripting to NET applications In recent weeks several examples of using IronPython to a scripting or interactive shells to NET applications have been posted by the NET community Command-line scripting of IronPython code in AutoCAD This post was heavily inspired by the code presented by my old friend Albert Szilvasy during his excellent AU class on using NET 4 0 with AutoCAD In this post we ll take Albert 's technique and implement a command-line interface for querying and executing IronPython script This approach could also be adapted to work with other DLR languages such as IronRuby of course Here 's the updated C code which now not only implements PYLOAD functionality but also a PYEXEC command nbsp Scriptability via the DLR and PostSharp nbsp Making an application scriptable (p articularly in a static language ) has historically been difficult With the advent of the DLR (D ynamic Language Runtime ) on the NET platform it becomes almost trivial to a scripting support to any application For a recent project I needed the ability to a scripting hooks throughout the application and coupling the DLR with PostSharp AOP attributes made this effort pretty straightforward Here 's how it was done Revit Python Shell Introducing RevitPythonShell According to wikipedia :\ Autodesk Revit is Building Information Modeling software for Microsoft Windows currently developed by Autodesk which allows the user to design with parametric modeling and drafting elements nbsp Building Information Modeling is a Computer Aided Design ( CAD ) paradigm that allows for intelligent 3D and parametric object-based design Jeremy Tavik blogs about working with the Revit API and in this post he discusses a Python Shell for Revit that created by Daren Thomas with IronPython Daren Thomas of the Professur für Gebäudetechnik Institut für Hochbautechnik at the technical university ETH Zürich has published a Python Shell for Revit It was implemented using IronPython and is used to automate the running of daily tests of a building energy analysis package Hosting IronPython via a Revit plug-in is a now solved problem Daren 's intention is to continue publishing samples of what you can do with it pretty regularly in the future The source code is available under the GNU General Public License v3 from a Subversion repository on code google com It is documented though there is currently little other stand-alone documentation One would probably want to look for the IExternalApplication entry point and go from there What the application does is A a button to the Revit ribbon to start the python shell Execute a python script entered in a text box with output going to a separate window Daren describes one of the main scripts like this it will open up an interactive interpreter loop known as a REPL that will let you explore the Revit API And by explore I mean type a statement hit enter see the results carry on It doesn t get easier as this Scripting ADAM with IronPython IronPython is an implementation of the Python language for the NET framework using the new Dynamic Language Runtime (D LR ) as language services layer on top of the Common Language Runtime ( CLR ) The DLR 's reusable hosting model makes it extremely suitable to a scripting capabilities to existing products In this post we ll create an ADAM command line utility that will allow us to run IronPython scripts against an ADAM application Our command line tool will expose a single command RunScript that will take in ADAM connection information and a path to a Python file to execute

some spring photo shoots at the park in Acton Waltham Boston and a few other places I think it will be lots of fun I 'm going to set up a studio shoot and try to photograph as many dogs as I can I 'm hoping that will be a good promotion for my photography business Still in the planning stages but more info will come soon Dog toys as just toys are so old skool Check out Nina Ottosson She has created a whole set of dog PUZZLES Yea average chew toys with some food in it isn t enough for the serious dog owner anymore You ve got to get the puzzle to really keep your pet entertained My mind thought that this might be a little o for a dog Almost mean because I would think the dog doesn t really care about the game only about the treat But in the article in the Bark magazine online she points out dogs that are goal driven like herding dogs really enjoy and learn the process I like the idea I 'm not sure my Toby would really be into it but I do know a few dogs at the park who would get a kick out of something like this to pass the time If they couldn t make it to the park that is flickr-photo border solid 2px 000000 flickr-yourcomment flickr-frame text-align left pa ing 3px

where the dogs spend most of there time We didn t get very far because the path was too icy We came back down and hung out with the Aussies There is always a few here at the park There can be as many as 12 or more on a busy day but that is more in the summer There were some new dogs who found there way to the park this weekend too Word of mouth is a powerful thing One dog Colby ( like the cheese ) just moved to the area and are really loving the open space his owner heard about the Acton park from a neighbor and found her way here It 's always good to have more dogs playing Colby met Ringo and played non-stop for almost an hour flickr-photo border solid 2px 000000 flickr-yourcomment flickr-frame text-align left pa ing 3px flickr-caption font-size 0 8em margin-top 0px Toby surrounded originally uploaded by phaird Winter can be hit or miss at the park When one day can be sunny and nice and the next could be windy snowing and cold you ll always have the regulars at the park They know what to expect and their dogs demand that they show up So the people show up all wrapped up in there winter gear faces covered gloves on and leash ready There was a group who showed up on sweat shirts thinking that would be enough in an open field with no protection from the wind I watched as they scurried back to their car to get their heavy coats Most of the dogs don t care Some like mine a small rat terrier with a short coat is much happier in doors on the couch wrapped in a blanket ( yea he 's spoiled ) But others like the Aussies love it They can run and never get over heated The community and interaction is something that they look forward to every week To be honest so do I flickr-photo border solid 2px 000000 flickr-yourcomment flickr-frame text-align left pa ing 3px

really cold for the past few days and even with the sun out I didn t last too long at the park Some dogs like the Aussies don t care at all They love being out in the snow running around chasing balls It was great for them The More the better Tikka Jake bella and others were all out today There is a pretty large group of Aussies who come very weekend and they are always great to see Very smart dogs they love coming out being around other dogs as well as good with people you never have to worry about them getting out of hand As herding dogs I d expect to see them chasing the other dogs around and try to keep an order but that isn t the case They hang out play ball and check in with there owners most of the time It does help that there owners love them dearly and treat them so well It 's nice

Before reading any of the reviews you should read the intro the FAQ the MOVIES I HAVE ALREADY SEEN list and if you want the glossary of genre terms and What is Horror which explains some of the that 's not horror entries There is also a handy recommendation thread that you can use to post suggestions for movies And to keep things clean all off topic posts are re-dated to be in JANUARY 2007 ( which was before I began doing this little project ) once they have expired ( i e are 10 days old ) Due to many people commenting I have to see this movie after a review I have decided to a Amazon links within the reviews ( they are located at the bottom ) as well as a few links to the Horror Movie A Day Store around the page hopefully non-obstructively Amazon will also automatically link things they find relevant so there might be a few random links in a review as well If they become annoying I ll remove the functionality Right now I 'm just kind of amused what they come up with ( for example they highlighted a horror movie in the mi le of one review and it links to of all things the 50 Chilling Movies Budget Pack ) Last but not least some reviews contain spoilers ( NOTE - With a few exceptions anything written on the back of the DVD or that occurs less than halfway through the movie I do NOT consider a spoiler ) I will be a ing 's poiler alerts for these reviews as I go through and re-do the older reviews ( longtime readers may notice that there is now a 's how more which cleaned up the main page as well as listing the source of the movie I watched i e Theaters DVD TV ) to reflect the new format This is time consuming so bear with me Thanks for coming by and be sure to leave comments play nice and as always watch Cathy 's Curse MARCH 16 2010 GENRE PREDATOR SURVIVAL SOURCE DVD ( ONLINE RENTAL ) I was surprised to learn that William Girdler was only my age when he died ( in a helicopter crash ) shortly after the release of his epic The Manitou I had figured he was in his 50s or something especially since that and his previous film Day Of The Animals ( aka Something Is Out There ) featured mostly mi le aged characters It 's rare to see someone write / direct a film populated primarily with characters that are far older than they are It 's really a damn shame that he died so young in just seven years he made NINE features all of which have a cult following ( and are quite entertaining at least of the ones I have seen ) I wonder what he would have done in the 80s Anyway Animals is a treat It 's apparently a but with more animals version of his previous film Grizzly ( which itself was a Jaws knockoff ) so I hope I haven t spoiled that film for myself but if its even half as much fun as this I 'm sure I ll still have a damn good time Like Frogs or Long Weekend the film is about animals taking revenge on the humans that have ruined their habitat but it 's far more entertainment-minded than those films And by that I mean I laughed at pretty much every death scene The key one is when Jon Cedar 's character is killed by snakes AND a dog ( o team up ) as he tries to get into a car that will allow him to rescue a little girl Stupidly backing into his snake-filled car he is first bitten a few times by the rattlers and such and then the dog leaps on him and tears him apart Not only is his death a bit of a surprise (s ince he was a pretty decent guy and had been more or less set up as a hero ) but it 's also a bit of a hilarious bummer since it seems likely that the little girl isn t going to get rescued either ( but she does much later ) I just wish there was some more variety or at least fewer dog attacks The film 's poster suggests an entire Wildlife Treasury box of antagonists but it 's primarily dogs for the film 's final half hour which is o as they aren t exactly forest dwelling animals They also prolong one of the dog attacks ( at the helicopter ) by obviously re-using shots I d rather the attack was just shortened and then maybe a lion or some rabbits show up and make things worse Can t go wrong with the cast though You got one of the many Christopher and Linda George ( real life husband and wife ) team ups although their characters o ly rarely speak to each other despite being in the same location for the bulk of the film Like Girdler George died way too young his performances are usually the highlight of the numerous horror films in which he starred during the late 70s / early 80s But even better Leslie Nielsen in a rare villainous role He plays the requisite asshole of the group ( a la NOTLD 's Mr Cooper ) and turns from mildly abrasive to full blown crazy over the course of the film ultimately attempting to rape one of the female members of the ill-fated hiking group ( after knocking around a woman AND her 10 year old son ) Even scarier - he plays his final scenes without a shirt If you ve only seen him in his spoof comedies this shit will blow your mind ( it 's still not as disturbing as his sleazy john character in Nuts however ) Incidentally one of his Airplane co-stars also shows up - the little girl who takes her coffee black like her men RIP Peter Graves by the way It also has enough characters to keep it from getting boring and refrains from killing them too quickly which allows for more suspense As with Tremors they repeatedly put supporting characters in danger but allow them to escape with minor injuries A movie like Rogue sort of weakens itself by keeping the supporting cast out of it for the entire last third of the film but this one keeps everyone around And Girdler split them into three groups so we get different settings different group dynamics and yes different animals ( though again dogs seem to be everywhere ) And as this is a 70s disaster film you get a wide variety of characters - a cancer stricken football pro a journalist a young couple Nielsen 's bitter businessman the mother and son etc Some faces may be more familiar than others but it really is an ensemble piece even the Georges don t have noticeably more screen time than the others And it stays with them - there are some haz-mat guys wandering around at the end but it 's not like The Crazies where we keep cutting away from the action to show government and scientist types yammering about the problem and how to solve it I just wish Media Blasters / Shriek Show had given the film more respect in the AV department The transfer itself is fine - in that it 's anamorphic and doesn t seem to be washed out But they were using a terrible print as the source the entire film is covered with scratches color artifacts ( the woods are purple during a big chunk of the climax ) and even skips At one point Nielsen is walking along with George talking about food and then su enly he is stopped talking to one of the other characters about something else entirely The sound is pretty lousy too it sounds like a record playing from the next room Basically it looks like the stuff you get on Mill Creek releases except you re paying 20 bucks instead of 20 cents The TV Version is also included and it 's taken from a much cleaner source ( no major print damage ) but it 's also washed out and horribly cropped - they seemingly matted the ( cropped ) 1 33 TV ratio to 16 9 which means you re missing the sides AND the top and bottom of the image Examples below No idea why they did this ( and obviously both versions are more compressed than they should be in order to fit what is essentially two films on one side of the disc ) but I wish they had looked for a better print or at least tried to clean up the one they had The technical issues carry over to the commentary too Lynda George is muffled Cedar sounds hollow and Scott Spiegel sounds like he 's outside of the recording booth entirely Spiegel is there to moderate presumably but he does a lousy job of keeping them on track For every story about the film itself there are about five about other movies / people / subjects entirely Some of them are amusing - George talks about Pieces - but others are extraneous at best I must admit I don t really care to hear their thoughts on the merits of Gigli the Mission Impossible movies or random Bill Shatner anecdotes especially when the audio is so all over the place The retrospective interviews are better especially as they include animal wrangler / co-star Susan Backlinie ( best known as the girl who gets killed in the opening scene of Jaws ) though George is absent for some reason ( they had her for the commentary they didn t grab an interview ) Basically it SOUNDS like a really great package on paper but the actual presentation is largely sho y and frankly amateurish Make sure you pick this up dirt cheap Now on to Grizzly Or Abby Girdler 's infamous Black Exorcist that was pulled after Warner Bros threatened to sue Anyone have a copy of that one What say you MARCH 15 2010 GENRE THRILLER SOURCE DVD (ST ORE RENTAL ) Remember the good ol days when legit horror movies were billed as psychological thrillers or whatever by horror-fearing producers Nowadays it 's the other way around standard thrillers like Possession are sold as full blown horror movies The DVD and trailers proudly point out that the film is from the producers of The Ring and The Grudge and the cover showed a ghostly Feardotcom -y figure that has fuck all to do with the film And the title was changed from A icted to Possession apparently in an attempt to get it to join Alien Monster Werewolf and several other films where the title shares a name with its would-be HMAD genre tagging Spoilers ahead If you notice I have not listed this as a Possession movie But if you ve seen the trailers or read a synopsis you know the basic premise behind the film - two brothers one an asshole ( Lee Pace - surprisingly effective as a hardass ) and the other a perfect man ( Michael Landes ) get into a car accident that leaves them both comatose Pace wakes up and claims he 's his brother having all of his memories and very much in love with the guy 's wife (S arah Michelle Gellar ) Is he possessed Did they switch bodies Or is the asshole just putting on the most gloriously complicated act in history so he can nail his sister in law I ll let you double check the genre tagging and make your decision Now to be fair at least it grounds the movie in some sort of reality in that there 's nothing supernatural or metaphysical about it - the dude is simply lying But in order to work we have to suspend far too much disbelief in fact even more than we would had there actually been a supernatural explanation Not only does he have to take on all of his brother 's mannerisms but he has to learn how to sculpt garden etc as his brother did ( whereas he seemed to be some sort of electrician in his asshole life ) He also has to hope that Gellar never asks him anything he can t answer such as I dunno one of the presumably millions of things they did together that the brother DIDN T take a photo of or write about in a love letter See Gellar finally figures out the ruse when she goes through her letters and photos and sees that her husband had written about every single thing that Pace had used to prove he was Landes It takes a full year for this to dawn on her which is stupid enough (d id she not READ the letters when they were given to her ) but again - did she restrict her inquiries to only the most memorable moments in their relationship I suppose we are to believe that the part of her that wanted her husband back allowed her to sort of live in denial a bit In fact that IS the point of the film 's original ending which is available on the DVD It makes the film even less of a horror movie but it 's at least more interesting Originally she realized he was lying and just let it slide because I guess she figured a guy pretending to be her husband was better than nothing In the ending on the film itself she confronts him and they have a typical chase through the house on a rainy night battle killing him in the process Her real husband remains comatose ( in the original ending they took him off life support ) There 's a bit too much repeated footage on the alternate ending ( it 's literally the entire last half hour of the movie but only about 5-10 minutes are different ) and again it makes its horror connection even flimsier but its definitely preferable to the one that ended up in the film from a creative / storytelling point of view If you are still interested in watching it after I ve just spoiled BOTH endings switch to the alternate after Gellar and Pace make love in the theatrical I also think they go a bit overboard with trying to make Landes seem like the perfect man He brings her flowers ( twice ) makes her a cake decorates the outside of their house with lights lights a bunch of candles doesn t mind when she forgets their anniversary fixes her grandmother 's necklace OK bu y you re a god and it would be a real shame if something bad happened to you WE GET IT The movie could have benefited from possibly not painting the brothers as such polar opposites - it would make the concept a bit easier to swallow and they could use that screentime to develop Pace 's character a bit more Why is he such a scumbag And where did he acquire such fantastic mimic skills Interestingly if you go back and watch the film a 2nd time ( or watch it knowing the ending ) you can see him learning his brother 's styles by watching him garden make love etc So he wasn t just being a creepy perv he was doing impersonate my brother research You know JUST IN CASE they both went comatose someday The DVD also has some other deleted scenes including one where William B Davis hypnotist character more or less spoils the ending which I assume is why it was cut The trailer is also included but you don t need it because the featurette is essentially just the trailer mixed with brief interview snippets with the stars and directors Joel Bergvall and Simon Sandquist who wear matching jackets Not very insightful stuff they basically reiterate the plot and try to make you think the movie is far more twisty-turny than it actually is You want a good version of the car accident / amnesia plot Watch Wolfgang Petersen 's 1991 thriller Shattered with Tom Berenger Good stuff GREAT twist And if you want to see Gellar deal with unexplained memory problems in an only-sort-of-horror setting watch The Return which is far more interesting than this movie ( and inches closer to horror territory to boot ) What say you P S I learned later that the film is (s igh ) a remake of an Asian film Anyone seen it Actually horror Many folks will mistakenly but understandably refer to Hatchet as Adam Green 's debut film but it 's actually his second His FIRST film was Coffee amp Donuts which was shot for 400 dollars using borrowed equipment from the cable company that he and trusty DP Will Barratt ( who has shot all of Green 's films ) made in 1999 The film showed at a single film festival ( where it won Best Picture ) and fell through the cracks as a result of (s adly aborted ) attempts to turn it into a sitcom Thus the film hasn t been shown since but that is about to change This Thursday March 18th the ( where else ) New Beverly Cinema will be showing Coffee amp Donuts for the first time in a movie theater ( or at all really ) in over a decade- But first Green will present his excellent new film Frozen in glorious 35mm complete with a Q amp A with the cast ( all three of the chair-bound heroes as well as Kane Ho er ) He will also be showing a few of his legendary Halloween short films And if we bug him enough maybe he ll talk a bit about Hatchet 2 ( which is now in post-production ) The whole shebang costs 7 measly bucks and you can buy your tickets online HERE ( which is a good idea since it 's very likely that the show will sell out ) See you there -Please note that C amp D will be a digital projection as it was shot digitally in the first place Again though Frozen will be a 35mm print MARCH 12 2010 GENRE GHOST SOURCE THEATRICAL (P RESS SCREENING ) Now THIS is a good romantic horror movie Unlike yesterday 's To Die For Conor McPherson 's The Eclipse takes time to develop its characters which not only makes the story far more interesting but also allows for the scares ( which to be fair are fairly limited - more on that later ) to really work I must admit I got jolted twice whereas I 'm usually amazed if they can get me once The film concerns a would-be writer ( Ciarán Hinds ) who volunteers for the annual literature festival in a seaside town in Ireland He gets directly involved with two of the authors a celebrity novelist played by Aidan Quinn and a horror novelist ( Iben Hjejle ) with whom Quinn had a one night stand with some time before ( and wants to continue the affair ) So yeah - it doesn t exactly scream horror but that 's actually what makes it work There are only five attempts at scares in the entire movie two of which made me jump and one ( the first ) just plain creeped me out And the reason they work so good is that the love triangle plot was compelling enough for me to keep forgetting that there was a horror element to the proceedings catching me off guard Now because the focus is on the romance / character study horror and nothing else fans will probably hate the film ( expect to see the word boring thrown around a lot if you read any reviews ) The horror elements are never really expanded upon - don t look for a scene where Hinds fights the ghost or digs up town records in order to find a bunch of exposition because it 's not there All of the ghost appearances are the result of his character 's guilt manifesting itself For example the first couple of appearances 's eem to be of his (s till living ) father-in-law who is in a nursing home and was left behind when the festival began ( Hinds forgot to pick him up ) Most movies would just have this sort of character flaw play out in a normal way - Hinds would realize his error and call the guy to apologize or drink or whatever In this movie he gets pulled into the ground by a bloodied arm ( whether the apparitions are real or psychological is never explained nor does it matter ) But they never go beyond that - brief but largely successful scares that help reflect the character 's state of mind Hinds is terrific in the film He 's in all but one or two scenes and those non-Hinds scenes suggest that the film will be a complete study of all three characters but ultimately the film is solely about his character 's grief ( his wife died before the film began - hence why he is in charge of looking after his father-in-law ) and how he tries to put himself out there after living in borderline seclusion for so long It 's a sad portrait ( Quinn provides the film with its few moments of humor ) which could border on depressing with a less appealing actor in the role but Hinds makes it not only watchable but enjoyable You really feel for the guy and want him to break out of his shell My only quibble is that they suggest some stuff and never really develop it into a meaningful plot thread Hjejle 's character writes ghost novels and they sort of suggest that she like Hinds is haunted by apparitions as well but never go beyond that hint Granted the film is about Hinds growth but it seems o to bring it up and not do anything with it she could have just as easily been a romance novelist for all the purpose her horror background serves to the story I guess we can assume that Hinds takes an interest in her because he thinks she can help him understand why he is seeing these things but she 's also a very attractive woman in his age group ( not that he fawns all over her ) so I don t think anyone in the audience would think much of it if they struck up a friendship without any supernatural-based connotations Then again it 's also an incredibly short film (88 minutes ) so maybe there was more to it and it was cut to keep the focus on Hinds ( and again keep the audience from thinking they were watching a traditional horror movie ) Magnolia is putting this one out which means it will probably debut on VOD at the same time as its theatrical release I 'm sure it will play just as well at home ( I doubt it will be playing in more than a handful of screens across the country ) but if it IS in a theater near you see it that way Magnolia has consistently released interesting genre fare over the past few years and I don t want them to abandon theatrical releases due to everyone simply watching them On Demand One final note - I find it ironic that after July another Eclipse will be considered the standard for a romantic horror film by millions of teen girls BUT I take some pleasure in imagining that come Christmas ( when both films will be on DVD ) some clueless aunt or grandparent will buy the wrong Eclipse for their 15 year old relative Aidan Quinn what Who Where the hell is Taylor Lautner Grandma What say you P S This is my 100th Ghost 'm ovie review Hurrah It joins Slashers Comedic Monster Supernatural and Psychological films in the Century Club Zombies should join the club next MARCH 14 2010 GENRE GHOST SOURCE NETFLIX ( INSTANT VIEW ) For years I had heard of The Entity as the movie where she gets raped by a ghost but I always assumed that this was sort of a spoiler an event that the film built toward ( not unlike describing It 's A Wonderful Life as being about a guy who sees what life would be like without him ) So I was surprised to see it happen pretty much in the first 10 minutes of the movie OK but NOW what I asked the TV The TV ignored me and kept on playing the movie but I soon had my answer not much Granted the film is based on allegedly true events so I can t knock it for being a bit inert but I CAN knock it for being over two hours long when it repeats a lot of stuff Two scenes of the ghost following her to her friend 's house at least four of her talking to Ron Silver ( who believes she is just crazy ) several more rapes etc It 's not a bad movie by any means but I felt like it sort of started at one level and never really went higher I think a touch more development prior to the first haunting and then some editing ( really just remove any 20 minute chunk in the mi le of the film ) could have resulted in an even better film But it 's still a pretty good one True or not the ordeal is pretty terrifying elevating it above the usual haunted house type movie The first time we see Barbara Hershey 's body being poked and pro ed by unseen hands ( a Stan Winston effect if I 'm understanding the credits correctly ) is not only a terrific effect in the technical sense but also a creepy one The tricky subject matter keeps the film from having any real sense of humor ( though I must admit I laughed when Silver asked if the ghost ejaculated partially because of his deadpan expression and partly because I think the idea of ghost jizz is pretty funny ) so even when the story occasionally dips into Poltergeist territory the tone is unlike it or any other haunting / ghost film I can recall And as with Emily Rose or ( to a lesser extent ) Haunting in Connecticut I liked that they provided enough plausible evidence for me to consider that Hershey maybe was just crazy Silver has a reasonable explanation for pretty much everything and it 's a concrete fact that her character suffers some serious sexual hang-ups ( molested by her stepfather impregnated as a teenager by a man twice her age etc ) so his theories certainly hold water at least for a while ( the scene in her friend 's apartment sort of solidifies the it 's a ghost idea once and for all ) The ending was a bit of a letdown though Again the film never really builds tension or suspense but there is at least an attempt at a climax when Hershey is placed in a replica of her house albeit one equipped with liquid helium tanks that will hopefully freeze the ghost while she remains safely inside a contained area (s o it hinges on the ghost being kind of gullible I guess ) But the attack is fairly brief and Silver never really has that Oh shit she was RIGHT moment that I think we deserve after listening to him argue with our heroine for the entire movie Sidney J Furie directed the film You may know him from the Iron Eagle films and a couple of late period Dolph Lundgren films Entity is one of his rare dips in horror ( he 's also billed as an uncredited director of Devil Doll ) which is a shame as I would have liked to have seen one where he was allowed to have a little more fun without being tacky / insensitive Half the movie seems to be shot in canted angles and there are a lot of De Palma esque di-opter shots to enjoy ( thank CHRIST for once Netflix offered a widescreen transfer for an instant viewing and the quality was pretty good as well ) I think he could have made a terrific or at least very stylish slasher movie Sadly he seems to have retired ( he had to exit his last film for health reasons and he directed his first film over 50 years ago ) so I doubt we ll get one Hopefully he 's at least back in good health This showed at midnight at the New Bev a few months ago and I missed it for some reason but I 'm glad I caught it at home Not only would the length have guaranteed some dozing but it 's not really a midnight type movie I caught Irreversible there at midnight and while the movie was quite good it didn t have that crowd experience that I associate with midnight screenings If I 'm gonna drive around LA at 2 am ( where the bullshit LAPD never bothers to stop people that are driving without their headlights a scarily common sight in Hollywood and even on the 101 freeway ) I want to have a good time more than I want to see a good movie What say you MARCH 13 2010 GENRE HAUNTED HOUSE WEIRD SOURCE THEATRICAL ( REVIVAL SCREENING ) You might wonder why I would knock on something like The Box for being a bunch of nonsense and yet praise Hausu ( House ) for being a bunch of nonsense Well the answer is simple as someone who prefers story to anything else I felt annoyed by Richard Kelly turning the intriguing and unique concept of The Box into yet another baffling Kelly-ish narrative about vessels and mathematics and whatever the fuck else was going on But in Hausu 's case I ve seen the basic plot ( teens visiting an isolated house that turns out to be haunted ) a million times so the batshit incomprehensible-by-design nature of it allowed me to be entertained by the story all over again If I had to pitch the movie to someone I would probably say it was David Lynch 's version of Evil Dead 2 or maybe The Grudge as written by James Joyce Blending animation splatter outright nonsense ( a dancing skeleton for example ) typical haunted house motifs and screwball comedy antics into a single film Nobuhiko Obayashi has created a stream-of-conscious horror comedy that simply must be seen to be believed and even then you ll probably figure you were dreaming part of it up Did I really just see a piano eat a girl you might ask yourself after the film has concluded Yes Yes you did The film 's structure sort of defies reviewing or even my usual sort of reactionary type posting It 's all so rambunctious and free-flowing I 'm hard-pressed to even bring up a specific scene Images certainly stick out such as a cracked mirror flowing with blood ( very cool ) or the kung-fu expert character ( named Kung Fu ) taking on a phone that explodes but I can no longer recall their context I could probably watch the movie a dozen times and still not have any better understanding of it but I know for sure that a single viewing is simply not enough to PROCESS everything The editing is rapid-fire the girls never really pause in between their lines and it 's got a pretty crowded cast ( about a dozen main characters ) despite only being 87 minutes long Some of the stylistic flourishes are a bit annoying though At one point the film appears to have been shot at maybe 12 frames per second which would be fine for a quick 's care shot but it 's used for a lengthy tracking shot consisting of the girls trying to exit the house and make a phone call while talking It gave me a bit of a headache honestly Perhaps it was an error that they couldn t afford or didn t have the time / cast to reshoot but it 's a blight all the same Many of the flashes are a delight though such as the o super-impositions frequent closing irises ( I muttered The end several times ) and blending of live action with animated / rotoscoped characters / objects Both Brian De Palma and Michael Bay would probably find Obayashi 's whims to be excessive Needless to say if you re one of the types of people who think Armage on 's editing or De Palma 's split-screen effects are the bane of cinema you shouldn t even look at the poster for Hausu Everyone else though by all means go see the film If you re in Los Angeles you can check it out at the New Bev until March 17th ( two shows a night ) and I 'm pretty sure other cities will be playing it as well as Janus has struck a new print for it There 's a UK DVD with some nice extras including lengthy interviews with Obayashi hopefully it will be ported to the US soon ( the UK one is linked below for you Region 2 capable folks ) I think seeing it with an equally bewildered crowd is part of the fun but even if you have to settle for seeing it on a 13 inch TV in your kitchen your life will still be the better for having seen it What say you P S If you have seen the film you know that the theme song is both wonderful and haunting And if you have seen the film AND are one of those techie geniuses please make it into a ringtone for me (p referably the Cat 's Meow variant ) Thanks If you missed the premiere or just can t get enough HMAD Live Tweeting will return on March 17th ( a Wednesday ) at 6 30 PST (9 30 Eastern ) This time the movie will be Zombie Death House ( available on Netflix instant view ) which is directed by THE John Saxon ( as if there could be another ) As before simply start the movie along with me and follow my live commentary on the official HMADLiveTweet Twitter page Yay technology See you then

e The next part of the problem is figuring out how to test for unbounded sequences A good approximation can be reached by running through n iterations and quitting if the magnitude of z exceeds 2 The magnitude of a complex number with real part a and imaginary part b is sqrt ( a ^2 + b ^2) For simple graphs a reasonable value for n is 100 Here 's what a simple Mandelbrot set grapher in JavaScript looks like for ( var x = 1 x for ( var y = 1 y var count = 0 var size = 0 var cx = xcorner + ((x * zoom ) / this width ) var cy = ycorner + (( y * zoom ) / this height ) var zx = 0 var zy = 0 while ( count count += 1 temp = ( zx * zx ) - ( zy * zy ) zy = (2 * zx * zy ) + cy zx = temp + cx size = ( zx * zx ) + ( zy * zy ) this Plot (x y count ) // count serves as a good color hint By setting the xcorner ycorner and zoom variables the above code allows you to pan across and zoom into various points in the set To accommodate for pretty visualizations you can use count to determine the color of the pixel A barebones implementation is available here mandelbrot js Although it is not a very efficient implementation it is very simple and if you squint hard enough you can see how the code relates to the visualization The Mandelbrot Set Generator is a harness I built with mandelbrot js Play with the parameters and let me know if you find anything interesting It also turns out to be a good br

Since I am aging and becoming Totally Old I would like a throbbing forehead vein like Clint Eastwood and various telekinetic manga characters A throbbing forehead vein - is that too much to ask If I had a rec room I would want either a swanky home bar with Christmas lights and old school beer signs or a massive model railroad set And if I had a 10 00 000 square foot rec room I would want something like Miniatur Wonderland (p ronounced 'm ini-ah-toor vunderland ) in Hamburg Germany the largest model railway in the fricking world If I couldn t have my own Miniatur Wonderland - because I 'm not building that thing - I would settle for Minotaur Wonderland a magical realm of daydreams and lollypops and prancing minotaurs or a massive retractable roof in my huge rec room so Harrier jets and my rocketpack commandos could land I ve said it many times one must have goals in life Miniatur Wonderland give to me June 15 2009 - Los Angeles after the Lakers NBA Championship win June 15 2009 - Tehran after sham elections and murderous crackdown on protesters Being a cop in the future would be bad-ass You get to wear riot gear fly around on jet packs and whack civilians with sick sticks or stun guns Future cops also get the coolest rides - at least in science fiction movies Here are the most kick ass and suck ass futuristic police vehicles ever according to Me - Police Spinner - Blade Runner Designed by the legendary Syd Mead the police spinner is a ground / air patrol car loaded with 300 lbs of red and blue beacon lights Judging from the picture above the spinner is powered by steam vents and suspension wires Who drives it Edward James Olmos puta Why it is cool Look at it It 's fucking cool Syd Mead designed it The spinner was created using practical effects and a full scale prop which automatically makes it cooler than any digitally created futuristic police vehicle Why it sucks The spinner has scissor doors that open vertically (s ee above ) which just lets in all that futuristic acid rain The Pursuit Special - Mad Max and Road Warrior This tricked out all black 1974 Ford Falcon XB coupe gets jacked by Max in Mad Max for his mission of vengeance and he just keeps the thing during the subsequent biker apocalypse in the Road Warrior With a 351 V8 engine a gnarly blower and double spoilers it is pretty much one giant surrogate penis Often incorrectly identified as a V8 Interceptor due to a line of dialogue spoken by a mechanic in Road Warrior it is actually identified as a Pursuit Special in Mad Max so that 's what I 'm calling it and oh God I have no life Who drives it Max Why it is cool I just explained why it 's cool The Pursuit Special is the automotive wet dream of an entire generation of Aussie gearheads Why it sucks N / A MFP Interceptor - Mad Max Some time in the not to distant future the Australian federal highway police force known as the Main Force Patrol will cruise the badlands in bright yellow 1974 Ford Falcons It will happen mark my words In 1979 's Mad Max our hero Max Rockatansky drive the bad ass V8 Interceptor - at least until he graduates to the Pursuit Special Who drives it Officer Max Rockatansky His name is on the side of his Interceptor as well as his nickname :\ The Dark One Why it is cool For starters the color scheme is awesome Lettering on the back of each patrol car reads either PURSUIT or in Max 's case INTERCEPTOR Plus the car appears in Mad Max the mother of all dystopian futuristic highway patrol revenge flicks Why it sucks This is what I 'm telling you it doesn t suck It 's not quite as cool as the Pursuit Special though is it Hill Valley Police Squad Car - Back to the Future II In the year 2015 female police officers will patrol the town of Hill Valley in hover-equipped squad cars and futuristic motorcycles The cops in Back to the Future II don t seem to be terribly effective but they have sweet rides Who drives it Unit N11-11 ( below ) Why it is cool The sloping aerodynamic pod shape of the Hill Valley PD squad cars are the main selling point They look like melted jelly beans Why it sucks They don t do anything particularly spectacular and the special effect sequence (p ictured ) of the hovering squad car looks dated I 'm nitpicking Lawmaster motorcycle - Judge Dre The Lawmaster is the vehicle of choice for MegaCity One 's fascist Judges who enforce strict bans on things like sugar and coffee Normal motorcycles aren t cool enough for Judges - they prefer cruising around in these tricked out unwieldy Lawmaster monstrosities Why Because they look bad ass Who drives it Judges Why it is cool Look at that thing it 's ridiculous The design is so over the top that you have to love it It 's like a jumbo action figure accessory Why it sucks I think it needs much fatter tires in order to look truly cool San Angeles Police Patrol Car - Demolition Man The pathetically ineffectual pacifistic cops of the futuristic megalopolis of San Angeles roll around in cool carbon-fiber police cars looking for kittens to rescue or trash to pick up That 's how they roll in the Sylvester Stallone film Demolition Man which features GM Ultralite low emission concept cars Maybe GM should have been making these things instead of Hummers n est - ce pas Who drives it Sandra Bullock Why it is cool As Stallone demonstrates if you crash one of these babies the inside is instantly filled with expanding crash foam that absorbs the impact That 's a nice feature unless you have issues with being entombed in asphyxiating foam Why it sucks See who drives it NYPD Cruiser - The Fifth Element The production design in Luc Besson 's could-have-been-awesome The Fifth Element is clearly the flim 's greatest redeeming feature - that and Gary Oldman 's crazy haircut One of the great things about Fifth Element is the use of models and practical special effects for their hover cars - as a result they look more solid and real than CG effects Who drives it Cops in ridiculously bulky outfits Why it is cool I like the retro-futuristic vibe these vehicles have If Dick Tracy was a 23rd century cop he would totally drive one of these babies They come equipped with neat communications gear a handy sliding side door and a winch / pulley system for mid-air prisoner transfer Why it sucks They look a little bloated like pregnant Spinners but I think that was the effect the filmmakers were going for Iowa State Patrol hovercycle - Star Trek A couple things you need to know about Future Iowa a ) it 's a desert wasteland b ) it has deep canyons / quarries and c ) it 's patrolled by motorcycle cops Who drives it Scary cyborg looking cops on hoverbikes who like the Beastie Boys Why it is cool While the scene in question may be more than a little goofy the hoverbike design is cool as hell Why it sucks Come on a 23rd Century rocket bike can t catch a kid in an antique car Laaame PreCrime Hovership - Minority Report This one kind of blurs the line between police car helicopter and hair dryer Regardless the hover units in Minority Report do qualify as futuristic police vehicles so I ll throw them in It doesn t mean I have to like it Who drives it Dept of PreCrime officers You thought I was going to make a Scientology joke didn t you Too easy Why it is cool I don t know they re kind of neat looking I guess They do look a little familiar Why it sucks Let 's just say Boba Fett is suing for copyright infringement Idiot Cop Car - Idiocracy I ll be honest I haven t actually seen Idiocracy but I 'm including this futuristic police vehicle because I 'm in love with the logo Who drives it Idiots Why it is cool Look at that logo That is straight pimpin Why it sucks Does it suck The blinged out logo alone redeems the vehicle Riot Control Garbage Truck - Soylent Green In the future you ll be so go amn hungry you won t even ASK where your food comes from Who drives it 14th Precinct Riot Control cops / food industry workers Why it is cool It scoops up hippies dumps them in the back and then makes food out of them That 's hot Why it sucks There are starving kids in China Stop criticizing the Riot Control Garbage Trucks and eat your soylent green youngster Sandman Ground Car - Logan 's Run TV series Sure the 1976 film Logan 's Run was awesome but do you remember the spin-off TV series They ran with the original concept but surgically removed everything about the original movie that made it unique and cost money Instead of taking place in a bizarre future city with expensive sets the Logan 's Run TV show took place almost entirely in a park in Southern California Cool car though Who drives it The ground car was driven by Sandmen fascist cops who ensure population control by making sure that everyone who reaches the age of 30 takes a once-in-a-lifetime spin on the lethal Carousel Why it is cool The Ground Car has a charming antiquated futuristic design and lots of stickers The gull wing doors scream THIS CAR IS TOTALLY FROM THE FUTURE Why it sucks It 's called a Ground Car which seems redundant I bet the Sandmen also have Water Boats and Sky Airplanes Detroit Police Patrol Cars - Robocop Rumour has it that Robocop was supposed to drive his own custom police car in the 1987 film Robocop but director Paul Verhoeven thought the Robocar looked stupid As a result our cyborg hero and the Detroit Police drive black 1985 Ford Taurus in the film Man the Robocar must have been pretty shitty if this was a better choice Who drives it The police of the future Why it is cool Umm I 'm drawing a blank here Why it sucks It 's a Ford Taurus Nuff said Grammaton Cleric Pimpmobile - Equilibrium I 'm a big fan of Kurt Wimmer 's Equilibrium flaws and all It 's got sword fights gun kata and a brooding ultra-serious Christian Bale ( as opposed to campy flamboyant Christian Bale ) Set in the city-state of Libria where emotions are illegal Equilibrium focuses on the anti- emo cops know as Grammaton Clerics who roll around in white Cadillacs - the car of the future Who drives it Christian Bale Taye Diggs Sean Bean Why it is cool It 's all white And therefore looks futuristic Why it sucks Man it 's like they re not even trying isn t it Look at those guys ( above ) They re embarrassed to be seen riding in the thing Clearly the producers just didn t have the money to create their own custom cars so they worked with what they had - and what they had were white Ca ies which are one step up from the pink Cadillacs that Mary Kay cosmetic salespeople drive Sad -I didn t include Will Smith 's Space Audi from I Robot because although he is a police detective he 's driving a civilian car not a marked police car Same goes for the cool Lexus concept car Tom Cruise drives in Minority Report - not a cop car Mick Jagger 's armored personnel carrier in Freejack doesn t make the list because it 's more of a paramilitary vehicle and it is driven by Mick Jagger Remember when Sam Raimi used to make horror movies Apparently so does Sam Raimi Drag Me To Hell is a return to Raimi 's schlock horror roots and that can only be a good thing Yes it 's a PG-13 horror flick and as a result it sometimes feels like Raimi is holding back on the really sick shit ( which we ll get on the unrated DVD version ) but I didn t feel like I was watching a watered down Evil Dead movie Drag Me works despite its relative lack of gratuitous gore and an anemic performance by the lead actress And do you know why Because it 's a balls-out Sam Raimi horror movie It 's creepy and gross and hilarious and most of all it 's just a lot of fun Need convincing In this film a toothless corpse gums our screaming heroine 's chin while drooling embalming fluid all over her A stapler is used as a melee weapon Somebody pukes up an entire kitty A scarf goes bad And when a goat shows up in the third act you just know things are going to go terribly hilariously wrong Go check it out You can t complain about Spider-Man 3 if you don t show up when Raimi actually makes awesome movies I often look at footage of the wildfires that sweep through the western states and think If only we had giant fire fighting robots I 'm not alone evidently because designer Jordan Guelde has created plans for a monstrous bright orange arboreal automaton that fights wild fires The robot is designed to eliminate the fuel that wild fires need to grow - in other words it chops down trees Sure you and I can chop down trees with a chainsaw or axe but we require things like oxygen and lack of fire to do so The Forest Fire Clear Cut Robot laughs at our human weakness It can chop down trees faster and do it more safely than a human crew - theoretically at least Right now it 's just a bunch of pretty computer graphics But when they start building these things I want one Give to me He 's a ten foot super giant with ginger hair and a neck as thick as a Sequoia He 's Stardust one of the proto-superheroes that appear in Supermen The First Wave of Comic Book Heroes 1939-1941 by Greg Sadowski and he is creepy as hell Supermen features an assortment of obscure early superhero comics produced in 1939-41 The comics are glorious primitive works of pulp science fiction crude ancestors of the modern superhero Yet there 's something vital and imaginative about these unsophisticated comics which clumsily explore superhero stories and ideas long before they calcified into cliche And holy shit some of those early superheroes were bizarre and terrifying Stardust is certainly unnerving but nothing matches the sheer weirdness of Fantomah the face-melting heroine Like many heroes of her time Fantomah had seemingly unlimited supernatural powers that she used to protect her jungle domain but what set her apart was her tendency for her face to transform into a hideous grinning skull Bleach blonde skull face woman She is a nightmare Stardust on the other hand embodies an entirely different type of weirdness He 's a red haired space giant who lives in a space castle and saves Earth from giant vultures - from space Stardust 's super powers are all over the map ranging from flight to the ability to transform enemies into worms to a deep penetrating inappropriate stare He also has a HUGE baby swallowing neck If Stardust ever perished in the Sahara scavengers would fight over Stardust 's thick juicy neck You could feed a pack of hyenas with that neck meat He should change his name to Neckro Or Golden Throat Or Dr Bigneck Anyway you can really get an idea of how freakishly huge Stardust 's neck is when the hero saves a helpless and unnamed girl from the space vultures Nameless Girl look out Stardust wants to swallow you I honestly can t tell if Stardust is meant to be that frickin huge or if the artist just had no concept of proportion and perspective whatsoever Regardless the end result is strangely compelling After wiping out the space vultures Stardust returns to the girl ( who begins every phrase with the word oh ) and looming uncomfortably close and staring at her he invites her back to his space castle Oh Stardust I d be crazy about it I 'm guessing that Stardust routinely rescues women like Oh Girl takes them back to his star feeds them fattening foods for a few months and then eats them That 's just how superheroes rolled back in the late Thirties Sure Barack Obama is the first African American president but did you know that he is also the first laser powered president No shit Obama is powered by a combination of moxie hope and 100 % pure laser energy I am totally not making this up I have proof poorly Photoshopped stock photographs of the President Behold Laser Obama

It has been a couple of days since I wrote my last followup blog entry about my dealings with Charter Communications I appreciate the fact that all of my initial service setup and installation issues were resolved in a professional and high quality manner Unfortunately the customer care service and treatment that I received was after the multiple problems had already occurred The customer care service and treatment after the multiple problems occurred should have been the customer care service and treament that I and all customers should receive from our very initial contact with this company Until Charter Communications takes a good hard look at how some of their customers are treated from their initial contact through installation of services and beyond and make some serious changes they will never being to compete with companies such as Cox Cable and Verizon Today is our first day here without one box to unpack I took my last 2 loads of broken down boxes and huge piles of the movers wrapping paper to the recycle center I was going to start going for my walks again today but it is rather cool and drizzly out I will start my walks again tomorrow My foot has been doing better Actually I have been so busy that I really have not had much time to pay attention to it even if it was hurting I guess I will have a better idea what shape it is in when I start my walking routine up For the normal around the house living it seems to be doing fine Veronica is just starting the hiring process for future employees at her new store Everyone seems very excited to have a new store here on the OBX They are conducting interviews at the local Ramada Inn in Nags Head I heard that one politician in the area told Veronica that she could expect approximately 5000 people to show up for the open employment interviews that will be conducted over the next 3 days From what I have heard unemployment for this area is extremely high over 25 % It is hard to believe that in about 45 days Veronica and I will be heading out to Alaska on our cruise By the time that our vacation does arrive we will surely be ready for a nice break We were invited to a grand opening of a local restaurant near where we live but unfortunately we could not go I am sure that we will try the restaurant out in the future It is less than a mile from where we live They also had a big parade a car show and a Taste of The Beach Festival going on yesterday but Veronica and I could not go to that either because we had to get the rest of the unpacking done and finished I am glad we did stay home and got everything done I am sure that there will be other events that we can go to as time goes by Later on this week we will go to take our drivers license test they have you take a written test around here Thank God there is no actual driving test given or else I could be in big trouble Of course even with the written test I could be in trouble Never was good with written tests Might actually have to break down and study Feels like I am going back to my High School days Finally all and I mean every single box has been gone through emptied broken down and taken out of this place except for a few boxes that we decided not to empty contents weren t needed My vehicle has about 40 or more boxes broken down in the back of it I will be going to the Recycle Center first thing in the morning After dropping off of the boxes I will return and load the RAV 4 up with all of the movers wrapping paper We ended up buying ourselves a new couch and a new dining room set Originally we were going to share an office and Veronica 's craft room Unfortunately after opening all of the craft room moving boxes it became very apparent that there was just no way that our computers and computer related furniture was going to fit in with all of that craft room items I could not believe how tight it was in there It really was unbearable So after a real brief discussion and I mean brief we both decided that it would be in our best interest to put our computer room downstairs in the 1st floor spare bedroom This is the bedroom that we were using for some indoor storage of extra boxes and rubber storage tubs So this morning Veronica and I got up early and moved all of our computer stuff downstairs It will be a while until Veronica has a chance to put her craft room aka The Studio together but when she does she will have a room all her own for her artistic endeavors I think that I will try to just relax the rest of today because tomorrow I will be on the run again Below are some photos of our new place Here are some photos of or bedroom Master bathroom 2 nd floor hallway Here is a photo of the door Behind this door evil lies Actually behind this door a real mess resides at least for now Veronica 's art studio 3rd floor landing Living room dining room library room and kitchen photos This is our new computer room rather spacious compared to the cramped room we were in and as a bonus it will be much cooler in the Summer months Today Veronica and I got up early to tackle our last major obstacle the craft room The boxes seem endless and it will probably take most of the day to get close to being done Hopefully we will get finished within the next 2 days so that maybe we can take a deep breath and possibly relax for a minute just a thought Shortly after I wrote and posted my last blog entry I received a comment from an Eric Ketzer You can view the posted comment by clicking the comments link on my previous blog entry As it turns out Mr Ketzer is the Social Media Communications Manager for Charter Communications To be honest with you I was really floored to have had someone locate my blog entry and then take the time to leave a comment and write me requesting information to help solve a problematic issue Mr Ketzer also sent me an email requesting information about my a ress the order number and information that applied to my installation A short while later I received a telephone call from another Charter representative named Antoine We ended up on a 4 way conference call with myself Antoine Brad ( the local installation supervisor ) and I believe it was someone from billing After discussing the situation it was agreed that Brad and / or another Quality Assurance Technician would be at my home this morning at 9AM Brad assured me that they would make everything right for me on the installation aspect of things The individual from what I think was billing told me that Charter Communications would compensate me for our troubles by giving us a free month of total service and there would be no charge for the installation After the telephone call ended I felt much better that we were heading in the right direction of getting this matter settled Brad along with the Quality Assurance Technician arrived here at 9 AM sharp and they went through the complete installation process for all of our services cable telephone and internet They checked whatever work that had been previously done by the last technician discussed options with me and made all of the appropriate changes so that I would get the maximum level of quality for each service that I ordered These 2 gentlemen were highly qualified very knowledgeable and made me feel very comfortable with everything that they did and all of the services that they provided me I want to publicly thank Charter Communications Mr Eric Ketzer Antoine the person from billing whom I spoke to on the telephone Brad the local Installation Supervisor the QA technician whose name escapes me sorry chalk it up to old age and another young lady by the name of April for helping turn this negative situation into a very acceptable and positive outcome I thank you all Now I can finally make full use of our new Samsung television life is good and so are the Kansas Jayhawk basketball team especially in HD Rock Chalk Jayhawk Beak 'm Hawks Our move is complete Everything was delivered to our new home last Friday The delivery was smooth and uneventful just the way I like it Spent 2-3 days running around getting everything unpacked and put away Luckily there is a recycle center only about 1 1 /2 miles up the road So after rolling up batches of packing paper and taping it into bundles and breaking down all of the boxes I was busy taking many loads to the recycle center Unfortunately we have been dealing with a few other problems which have made this move unpleasant up to this point in tie In a previous blog entry I had made mention about the trouble I was having getting our car insurance transfered over to North Carolina The agent that I had been dealing with had made a couple of mistakes when he entered information as far as my a ress and other important info needed for my insurance This agent had switched numbers on our PO Box number Because of this error it has caused us not to receive any documents from State Farm showing that we indeed have insurance coverage in North Carolina Every time I called him he said that he mailed the paperwork to me After I found out that he had mailed it to the wrong a ress I requested that he change all documents to the correct a ress Unfortunately this has been difficult to get accomplished at the cooperate level for some reason We were planning on going to get our drivers license today and I told the agent this a couple of days ago He told me that if I call him before I go to DMV that he would fax the forms over there to show proof that we had auto insurance I was not comfortable doing that because we had not had much luck with him getting things done correctly along with the fact that I was afraid that I would not be able to contact him before we headed to get our drivers licenses and even if we did contact him that we would get to DMV only to find out that he had not faxed over the paperwork that we needed The bottom line is that I had lost all faith with this agent and was not comfortable dealing with him any longer Heaven forbid we should have an accident and needed someone that we could depend upon to provide us with the proper service or help us with any insurance needs that we might have I placed a telephone call to the head of that agency and left a message for him to call me I did not hear from him until later on the next day and by that time I had already put into motion a transfers of our auto insurance policies to another agency Had he called me the same day that I had called him we would have most likely stayed with his agency but utilized a different agent within his agency Because of the error of putting the wrong mailing a ress down initially it will take a couple of weeks for this all to be settled and straightened out and for all of our auto insurance policies to be transferred over to this new agency And now for the icing on the cake Charter Communications My experiences and frustration with Charter Cable has been previously documented in some earlier blog entries but with yesterdays fiasco Charter Communications really outdid themselves Below is a brief synopsis of the customer service that we received from Charter Communications The tech was running behind and showed up 45 minutes late 3 45 no big deal because it happens all of the time As soon as he got there we knew we were in for trouble The place where we live is brand new It has all of the wiring within the walls for telephone cable and internet services Nothing on the outside has ever been hooked up so basically the tech is starting from scratch Right from the start he is complaining about how behind he is and how many more service calls he has scheduled for the afternoon He comes inside and looks at the number of telephones that we have 3 to be exact and all are different The tech tells us that we should have one main bank for 3 identical phones to charge in This would have made his job easier he made it sound like everyone has a set up like he wants and made us feel that we should go out and buy a system like the one he was speaking about The tech spent the next 4 hours complaining about the num ber of stairs he was having to climb the number of times he had to go up and down those stairs he was on the phone talking to another tech and a sking her if she had heard the crazy lady that he had as a customer earlier in the day and then proceeded to tell me that this lady ( another customer ) was a lunatic bitching to me about the number of jumpers that he was putting together and the number of splitters that he had to use It was just complaint after complaint After he once again was complaining about him missing other appointments I told him that his complaint should be with whoever does the scheduling not with me The longer he was there the more tense and stressful the situation became I found this tech climbing on our bedroom dresser so that he could plug in a cable wire On several telephone calls that he had with what sounded like other techs he was heard complaining about the job that he was here for He complained and blamed us because this job was taking so long that he was losing money by not being able to get to other installation appointments Before everything was done this tech had packed his stuff up and taken it all downstairs to his truck By this time there were cable wires laying over our bed the nightstand was pulled out and had some unknown type of equipment on it must have something to do with the phone and basically cables laying here there and everywhere I mentioned to the tech that the upstairs television had not been hooked up to the cable wire and that he did not leave any cable wire for me to hook to tv up to it It was at this time that things got real nasty The tech told me can t you just go out to a store and buy some cable wire and are you too cheap to buy some cable wire and all of my wire and tools are down in the truck and I have already done a bunch of jumpers splitters and 50 cables for you I could not believe what I was hearing I then looked in our office / craft room where our computers are and my desktop had not been hooked up to the internet I told the tech that this job was not complete He then stated that he would hook the wire up to my computer he was saying it in a really sarcastic fashion We explained to him about all of the things that were not done and about his behavior throughout the 4 hour ordeal He really did not have much to say about it other than to reiterate the amount of work that he had to do and the number of appointments that he missed because of us It became a rather personal thing at thing point We told him that we were customers too and that the service that he provided was not acceptable We told him that we wanted a receipt for money that we owed Charter Communications they take 90 COD and then apply that amount towards your first bill We got our receipt but refused to sign off on one of the sheets of paperwork that he had Veronica did sign off on one of the pieces of paperwork but also wrote on it that the job was not complete and that we would be contacting a supervisor As soon as the tech left I did file a formal complaint with Charter Communications After not hearing from anyone this morning I called Charter Communications back again and spoke to a supervisor This supervisor was able to pull up my my official complaint from last night which listed in detail all of the things that were done were said and not done by this technician The supervisor got in touch with the local dispatcher and the local installation supervisor I am now awaiting a call back from the local installation supervisor so that we can discuss and rectify this situation Never in my life have I ever received such poor quality service from any company nor have I ever had a technician that behaved in such a rude and unprofessional manner Hopefully I will have happier news in the near future but for now the beat goes on I got up early this morning and drove to OBX I went to the management company and got our keys I then went to our new condo and unloaded my car I put up the curtain rods curtains shower curtains along with a bunch of bathroom towels It ended up being one of those days if anything could go wrong it did I finally got everything and all of the extras that were packed in the car got put away One thing I forgot to bring was some window cleaner and paper towels I was planning on cleaning up things in the kitchen and bathrooms Probably a good thing that I forgot the spritz because it took me all day just to get everything else done Although everything is brand new this condo has been closed up for a couple of years now so everything will need a good cleaning Tomorrow night the computers get torn down so I won t be back online until the 10 th of March at least that is when Charter is supposed to install cable telephone and internet So the next blog entry will be coming from our new place After not hearing from the Charter Communications rep about my initial assigned telephone number being lost out in limbo land I decided not to wait around for them to find it I went ahead and took the new number I also went ahead and made my way through my long list of businesses to contact and let them know my new new telephone number Monday I will be heading down to OBX early in the morning I need to stop by and pick up our keys and then head over to the place I have a vehicle full of stuff to unload and then I need to start putting up curtain rods and curtails After that I will do some work in the bathrooms putting up shower curtains and towels Hopefully I can get it all done during this one trip On Wednesday the moving crew comes to box everything up and then on Thursday they will be here early to pack the truck Starting on Wed we won t have any internet nor computers We won t have any internet until 3 /10 at which time Charter will come out to our new place and set us up with telephone internet and cable service This upcoming week with be hectic to say the least be at least we are making progress

a = % d n new_foo - a ) delete new_foo return 0 g ++ -o pod pod cc / pod new_foo- a = 7 But if we simply a empty parens to our new Foo we ll get different behavior ( again this is only because Foo is a POD type ) cat pod cc include struct Foo int a int main () Foo- foo = new Foo () foo- a = 7 delete foo Foo- new_foo = new Foo () printf (\ new_foo- a = % d n new_foo- a ) delete new_foo return 0 g ++ -o pod pod cc / pod new_foo- a = 0 And that 's about it The two forms are nearly identical They behave the same except when used on a POD type in which case the form with parens initializes the members to zero Perhaps not that useful but somewhat interesting I 'm moving soon and I 'm trying to get Comcast setup at the new location I went through their online ordering process and aside from the fact that there was no useful information given to differentiate one package from another the process wasn t too painful until the last step At the end of the process they require that you chat with a representative online in this sho y Java applet I assumed the representative would simply verify some information then wrap things up But actually she said that she needed my SSN She also reassured me numerous times that COMCAST is all about protecting customer confidentiality and that my information is secured and cannot be viewed by anyone else Hmm I thought to myself I do see that this applet was loaded on a page fetched using https but how do I know that the applet itself is communicating with the server securely So of course I immediately started tcpdumping the session sudo tcpdump -s0 -i en1 -A And sure enough I started seeing unencrypted communication between the applet and the server ( applet - server ) 21 54 36 590164 IP 10 0 1 198 60082 66 179 151 44 http P 26477 27264 (787) ack 37992 win 65535 E N B P 0 6 P e GET / sdccommon / lachat / poll / send_msg asp fmt = sst dtype = msg Msg = HTTP /1 1 Cache-Control no-cache Pragma no-cache User-Agent Mozilla /4 0 ( Mac OS X 10 5 5 ) Java /1 5 0_16 Host www comcastsupport com Accept text / html image / gif image / jpeg -

)] Also we did not build Update Engine to compete with Sparkle We built Update Engine to solve different problems If you re interested here 's my reply about this in the Google Group for the project I updated gcalc to fix an issue caused by Google changing the HTML around the Google calculator answers ( they a ed an extra h2 tag ) No biggie but gcalc now works again You can get the new version here Also I made gcalc a (s mall ) code google com project So you can now check it out at http // code google com / p / uj-gcalc / The other day I needed to find the location of an application using its bundle ID Easy just use LaunchServices But I needed to do this from a script Here are a couple perl one-liners to do it perl -MMac ::P rocesses -e printf % s n LSFindApplicationForInfo ( undef com apple TextEdit )\ / Applications / TextEdit app mv / Applications / TextEdit app / Desktop / perl -MMac ::P rocesses -e printf % s n LSFindApplicationForInfo ( undef com apple TextEdit )\ / Users / jgm / Desktop / TextEdit app mv / Desktop / TextEdit app / Applications / perl -MMac ::P rocesses -e printf % s n LSFindApplicationForInfo ( undef undef TextEdit app )\ / Applications / TextEdit app (Y es I know mdfind could do something similar But it wouldn t necessarily return the one that LaunchServices thinks is the preferred one if there were multiple applications with the same bundle ID ) There 's often confusion about the difference between the following three declarations in Objective-C id foo1 NSObject -foo2 id lt NSObject gt foo3 The first one is the most common It simply declares a pointer to some Objective-C object (s ee / usr / include / objc / objc h ) id gives the compiler no information about the actual type of the object so the compiler cannot do compile-time type checking for you Thus the compiler will let you send any (-) message to objects declared id Actually this is why the common idiom of [[ Foo alloc init doesn t cause the compiler to complain + alloc is declared to return type id so the compiler won t yell when you then send the returned object the message init ( or even initWithMyFoo blah ) So objects declared using id are just dynamically typed at runtime The compiler has no useful information about the object 's real type so it can t warn you if you send it a message that it may not respond to Just because we know that an id is an Objective-C object does not mean that it points to an object that derives from NSObject or that it even has common methods like retain and release One solution is to statically type our variable using NSObject- as shown in number 2 above This gives the compiler information about the class of the object pointed to by foo2 so the compiler can warn if you send a message to foo2 that an NSObject doesn t respond to This means you can safely call retain release description etc but the compiler will warn if you call length or count or anything that an NSObject doesn t respond to So declaring a generic pointer of type NSObject- is very similar to what you would do in other languages like Java but it 's really a bit too restrictive for a language as flexible as Objective-C Despite what you may have learned at one point not all Foundation / Cocoa objects derive from NSObject As an example NSProxy is not derived from NSObject so the foo2 pointer above would not be able to hold an NSProxy subclass even though NSProxy does implement common methods like retain and release What you really want is a pointer to any object that behaves like an NSObject And that 's exactly what the third case does Declaring an object as id lt NSObject gt tells the compiler that you don t care what type the object is but you do care that it conforms to the specified NSObject protocol-- The compiler will ensure that all objects you assign to that pointer conform to the required protocol A pointer typed like this can safely hold any NSObject ( because NSObject conforms to the NSObject protocol ) but it could also hold any NSProxy because NSProxy also conforms to the NSObject protocol In english the declaration id lt NSObject gt foo3 says foo3 is a pointer to an object of any type that behaves like an NSObject This is very powerful convenient and expressive In reality we often don t care what type an object is we just care that it responds to the messages that we want to send it ( e g retain release ) So how do you decide which form you want to use It 's pretty easy If you don t want ( or can t have ) any type checking then use a plain id This is very common for return types on methods that don t know the type of object they re returning ( e g + alloc ) It is also common to declare delegates to be type id because delegates are generally checked at runtime with respondsToSelector and they usually aren t retained However if you do want compile-time type checking you must decide between the second and third cases Well let me just help you out mdash you want the third case - ) I ve very very VERY rarely seen a situation where NSObject - worked but id lt NSObject gt would not And using the protocol form has the advantage that it will work with NSProxys You may think that you never use NSProxys but Cocoa 's distributed objects system makes heavy use of NSProxy subclasses A itionally the common case is that you simply want to ensure that an object can be retained or released and in that case the protocol form conveys that intent better you really don t care what class the object is you only care that it behaves like an NSObject - Well not any 'm essage If you send a message using a selector that the compiler has never seen it may warn that it has never seen that selector This is nice in the event that you mistype init as inti -- Now when I say NSObject here I 'm talking about the protocol ( @p rotocol ) named NSObject There is also a class named NSObject that does indeed conform to the NSObject protocol but they are two different things Markd over at the Borkware Miniblog posted some great pictures mdash and hilarious captions mdash of Macworld 08 
Some of you may know the legend of the long lost film The White Gazelle made by Tony Laudati in I believe 1981 ( ) It was featured in Cinemagic magazine long long ago but until now the movie itself was unavailable for viewing to anyone who didn t know Tony personally Well thanks to today 's digital culture it 's now available - for 99 cents no less ( ) on a site called Filmginder White Gazelle on Filmgrinder This is an amateur production shot in 16mm but featuring some incredible sculpting and in-camera compositing effects The compositing isn t as flawless as it would be if shot on 35mm film with a pin-registered camera the 16mm models are known to suffer from what 's called film weave making compositing effects tricky All that said as soon as I found out the film was available I went ahead and downloaded it I was able to pay through my PayPal account simple as pie and no problems whatsoever with joining the site or getting the download I really love the atmosphere of this movie There 's something primal about it watching this caveman and his woman I get a real sense of how tough life was in paleolithic times and what 's more I get a strong sense of shamanism Magic and mojo the basis of all art and performance leading right up to and including of course stopmotion itself Needless to say I highly recommend this ESPECIALLY for the price Yes Life stirs once again in the Darkstudio My winter vacation is over and Im back to work on the film And what 's more I 'm just about ready to start shooting Hopefully in a few days For today 's update I got the bar stools all painted up looking nice and grungy Hey people sorry I haven t updated in so long It 's been insanely cold around here hovering around 5 degrees F and ranging up to about 15 for a few weeks now Too cold in the basement for glue or paint to set right and for human habitation too I haven t been down here for more than about ten minutes at a stretch and even then I wrapped my lower half up in a sleeping bag and wore lots of layers So no work on the set recently but now the cold front has passed so work should resume Actually I already got a few small things done but nothing worth posting pics yet See ya soon Last night I decided to put the new wall onto the set even though I have more work to do on it I wanted to see it all together for a preview and mess around with lighting to try to find an approach to use for this film This link should take you to Photobucket and from there you can download the full size image it looks SO MUCH better than this little rinky-dink version (s croll over the picture to see the download option ) This is what the shot was looking like at first Download this one here Note the problems with the lighting very hard glaring light on the foreheads and the faces in shadow This is a result of the way they re sculpted Note I am NOT dissing Scott Radke 's sculpting I LOVE these heads but because of the way they re done eyes set so wide and facing different directions bare foreheads with no hair covering them that face directly into the light plane and somewhat glossy paint - it makes them very hard to light It 's a challenge ( like everything about this project ) And it 's forcing me to dig deep and find a different way to work Here 's the solution that 's working best so far These are my lights I 'm only using 2 for this shot and note they re both facing FORWARD rather than the more normal option of being aimed directly at the set See the next image to understand WHY See the big white sheets of paper fastened to the front of the set They re reflectors The lights are both aimed at them and then only reflected light is bounced back onto the set to light the puppets for this pic I actually had a light aimed directly at the set just to make things show up better Reflected light has some very nice properties it 's very diffused doesn t cast a clear shadow and it has a lot less glare than direct light does And because this is all fill light coming from the front it fills in details like the eye sockets that were in deep shadow before This kind of reflected lighting seems to be the only solution to the lighting problems posed by these heads But if you compare the two shots above even though the direct lighting causes glare and shadow problems it has a much more dramatic look to it creating great shadows that define the form of the heads the fully reflected light doesn t do this In fact reflected light like this is often called cartoon lighting because of the lack of drama and overall illuminated feel I want to try to find a halfway solution I think if I can aim a light or two directly at the set with plenty of neutral density gels ( grey color filters ) to dim them down while still keeping the reflected lighting I currently have I should be able to get the best of both worlds Time will tell Making yet another brick wall why do I torture myself like this This is the last major set piece after this it 's just a matter of putting it all together finishing up a few loose ends and doing final set dressing before launching into actual animation Hard to believe after 3 long years this film is actually going to happen It took a lot of work to turn a pice of foamcore into a brick wall here it was at one point So much cutting and the hardest part was peeling off both paper facings from each brick individually ( too hard to peel a large piece ) But it 's done now aside from a little more painting and detailing Soon I ll show some of the props I ve been making I ve made several brick walls before Buster 's hat tip test Race the Wind and my first for the Ahab tests when I look at that bucket of peeled bricks just above I clearly remember the History Channel show about Einstein that was on as I laboriously peeled each one And for Race the Wind it was a Victoria 's secret Runway Show ( that one was a bit distracting ) I don t recall the other ones but it 's funny how certain kinds of work lend themselves to that kind of memory retention possibly it 's the tedious repetitive jobs that allow us to pay attention to something else as we work Here 's a motion test I shot some time ago actually it was before I had the Lumix camera done with my Hitachi I think I used a big zoom lens which probably accounts for why out-of-focus things look so weird here I was trying to develop a certain kind of motion that I could see in my head for this film the characters and the camera all moving in unison like an orchestrated dance Oh and yeah I know he has some kind of neck spasm there Rotational movement is hard to keep under control so I learned something valuable from this test I ve learned how to use a framegrabber a lot better since then though I really haven t tried another head turn like this - something I ought to do soon This is amazing Just posted on the message board and in production for some time already over at the Karlsruhe University of Arts and Design in Germany stopmotion puppets placed in a CG environment that was created ( and framegrabbing done ) using Blender open source 3D software I must say this definitely looks like one of the coolest films I ve seen being made recently for a long time actually I wish I had come up with this idea Check out their blog http // www artificial3d com / omega / IN a pair of recent posts - Analyze this and the followup Analysister -I brought up the idea of some aspects of a movie (s urface story ) being readily discernible to the left ( logical ) brain and some more subtle parts to the right ( intuitive ) brain I had never thought about this until making the Analyze this post and discussing the way Kubrick 's films seem to work on a viewer For convenience 's sake I ve included a table below listing the well-known attributes of these two hemispheres of the brain Right Brain vs Left Brain Definition This theory of the structure and functions of the mind suggests that the two different sides of the brain control two different 'm odes of thinking It also suggests that each of us prefers one mode over the other Discussion Experimentation has shown that the two different sides or hemispheres of the brain are responsible for different manners of thinking The following table illustrates the differences between left-brain and right-brain thinking Left Brain Right Brain Logical Sequential Rational Analytical Objective Looks at parts Random Intuitive Holistic Synthesizing Subjective Looks at wholes Article It su enly occurred to me that this division between two different ways of thinking sounds very familiar in fact I ve encountered very nearly the same division between ways of thinking - one logical and focused the other intuitive and fuzzy but in a non-scientific context The Apollonian / Dionysian dichotomy Apollonian and Dionysian are terms used by Nietzsche in The Birth of Tragedy to designate the two central principles in Greek culture The Apollonian which corresponds to Schopenhauer 's principium individuationis (\ principle of individuation ) is the basis of all analytic distinctions Everything that is part of the unique individuality of man or thing is Apollonian in character all types of form or structure are Apollonian since form serves to define or individualize that which is formed thus sculpture is the most Apollonian of the arts since it relies entirely on form for its effect Rational thought is also Apollonian since it is structured and makes distinctions The Dionysian which corresponds roughly to Schopenhauer 's conception of Will is directly opposed to the Apollonian Drunkenness and madness are Dionysian because they break down a man 's individual character all forms of enthusiasm and ecstasy are Dionysian for in such states man gives up his individuality and submerges himself in a greater whole music is the most Dionysian of the arts since it appeals directly to man 's instinctive chaotic emotions and not to his formally reasoning mind Nietzsche believed that both forces were present in Greek tragedy and that the true tragedy could only be produced by the tension between them He used the names Apollonian and Dionysian for the two forces because Apollo as the sun-god represents light clarity and form whereas Dionysus as the wine-god represents drunkenness and ecstasy Article I discussed this in an old post on my original blog http // www darkstrider net / july8_2005 html Sorry I can t link directly to it I used to hand-code that blog and didn t know how to separate posts so I can only link to the entire page but it 's the second post Just scroll down a little bit I was profoundly taken by this idea when I first encountered it in Camille Paglia 's book Sexual Personae and she really made me aware of these two different modes of perception / cognition These little tables I posted here and similar ones you see on the web are very brief and only cover the basics but Paglia dissects it quite deeply She also relates these modes of thinking to what she terms the Male principle and the Female principle left brain / Apollonian being the male and right brain / Dionysian being the female Don t oversimplify and think she 's making a general division between men and women people have some of each tendency in their makeup just as we all use both left and right brain Many women exhibit strong male tendencies while many men have female tendencies Well when I connected these various ideas together it became clear to me that they are very real tendencies that exist in all of us Modern sbrain science as it often does is merely re-inforcing ancient wisdom The Greeks were aware of this dichotomy centuries ago and now it 's been discovered in the very structure of the brain itself so science has only shown us figuratively where Apollo and Dionysus live It makes me wonder how many of the other Olympian gods could be said to embody some part of human nature god of war go ess of the hunt go ess of love interesting And doubtless not new Only something that hadn t occurred to me before So taking all this into account the idea of a dichotomy in modes of thinking that 's existed in human nature for a long time and that it 's cropped up in various ways both scientific and mythical / artistic I began to wonder if it 's reared its head in any other ways And sure enough a couple similar dichotomies presented themselves to my questing mind Dichotomy in politics Exploring the neurobiology of politics scientists have found that liberals tolerate ambiguity and conflict better than conservatives because of how their brains work In a simple experiment reported today in the journal Nature Neuroscience scientists at New York University and UCLA show that political orientation is related to differences in how the brain processes information Previous psychological studies have found that conservatives tend to be more structured and persistent in their judgments whereas liberals are more open to new experiences The latest study found those traits are not confined to political situations but also influence everyday decisions This is just a section of an article posted here To condense these tendencies down to their most basic ( for purposes of simplicity ) we could call one Focused and the other Vague or Fuzzy Which then led me to my next ( and so far last ) revelation Rods and Cones Article Two different kinds of photoreceptors or neurons in the eye Rods are responsible for night vision and peripheral vision they re not as focused as the cones which see detail and color Therefore the vision of the rods could be characterized as fuzzy or vague but in some way superior to the rod-vision Have you ever noticed that if you re looking up into the night sky very dim stars or very distant galaxies ( which at first look like dim stars ) can t be seen by looking directly at them ( cones ) but only by looking a little bit away activating the rods To me all these various dichotomies sound very similar In fact I d venture to say taken as a whole they point out the same basic division in the human being a divergence between different modes of is it perception cognition or interpretation Hard to say And I won t make any statements here aside from bringing up what I think is a very interesting conundrum revealing itself to us in various ways - Mythical ( a way of giving meaning to things we don t understand ) Scientific ( a way of studying nature ) and Political -- and that might have a profound meaning as far as what it means to be human And with this post hopefully I conclude this little obsession that began just before Halloween when I happened to catch The Shining on cable TV ( little realizing the bizarre series of ideas it would lead me through ) and can now get back to work on my film 
Absolutely stunning digital rendering Wow that is really stunning work and very creative A quote from the author Staszek Marek The most beautiful places that come to mind always have water steep cliffs and tropics in common Lush turquoise colors emphasizing positive vibes something I ve never seen I wanted to achieve complete integration of future architecture with nature complete with green parks trees and gardens What caught my eye and train of thought right away was his remarks about how big an influence the landscape is in relationship to the architecture Renderings like this the creativity needs to be shared There are a number of other entries here be prepared to be amazed Powered by ScribeFire Great story in the NYTimes about Laura Spector who goes out into the woods alone and cuts down all the vine (s) she can pull out to make something great out of something very bad From the Laura Spector website Apparently she targets Bitttersweet or Asiatic vine Celastrus orbiculata which has run amok in her part of the woods Her specialty apparently a little of everything-sconces mirrors arches furniture etc Good for her From the story I go out into the woods alone everywhere she said And I go deep a mile or two in from roads The hardest part is schlepping the stuff out alone I have letters of permission from places like the Aspetuck Land Trust and Aquarion the water company They re happy to lead me to the worst infestations as long as I indemnify them in case I fall Here 's another great piece from Laura 's website which I am linking you to the NYTimes does not One of Laura 's benches I love that Koa wood slab Great stuff really great imagination In her own words My work is unique in that it is influenced by the rich and decorative18th Century British Romantic tradition British rustic is unique from its more familiar American cousin in that its graceful lines follow nature 's whimsy yet suggest the complexity of wrought ironwork Finally this piece of railing [V ery nice keep up the good work Laura Powered by ScribeFire I noticed that folks are still stopping by looking for info on Pergola 's and such Be advised that I have indeed been at this new site for quite awhile Still discussing pergola 's renderings landscape construction drawings waterfeatures ponds landscape construction etc Even though I enjoyed my time here and appreciated the recognition of the Blogger staff I moved over to Wordpress com It was not an easy decision because I had to hand export over 250 post and find a way to move comments also It was the opportunity to have several pages to a a itional info which also allowed me to clean up the front page of my Blog I don t know if I 'm a minimalist at heart but my inner designer likes clean and simple So here I am gone to Wordpress Here again is the new site If you were kind enough to set up a link to this page from your Blog or page I would appreciate it if you would change that to my new Blog site over at Wordpress I appreciate the fact the you thought enough of what I am doing to link to my page and I hope that will continue over at my new site Again thanks a lot in advance I look forward to your readership comments and feedback Landscape Design and Design is important to our lives and good design makes our life more enjoyable more pleasant and more civilized I will continue to write about what I see hear learn and ponder about as I continue my life 's work My friends have all chimed in one way or another and have decided they like the Wordpress look better So I will respect their opinions and move The only real question left for me is do I stay at Wordpress com or do I move entirely over to another type of site As in a paying site Where I can have the blog hosted and at the same time move the WCI website to also There are ( for me ) plus es and minus es to both sides of this equation All of this is going to have to wait until I get back from the Mgmt Clinic in Louisville KY this coming week I trip I am looking forward to-this is a very good conference lots of high energy So for now dear readers keep catching me over at the other site where I am posting like mad like mad I tell you yes actually mad I wonder how do you spell plus es and minus es Well I have almost everything moved over to the Wordpress site I am almost certain I am moving over there The swag chiclets (sp ) and buttons are not over there and I am not sure how that is going to work out I really do not want to a anymore to the sidebar If needed I will a those to another page I have a ed everyone 's link in the link page and think it looks good and those links look easy to find The page loads faster over there and I like the cleaner look-hey I 'm a Designer I Design I like clean simple lines Just look at my work Now I know graphic design is entirely different than Landscape Design but aesthetics are aesthetics aren t they Take a look but I am pretty sure this is a done deal unless a flood of folks say different The biggest reason not to leave is that Google loves me it really loves me I hope it happens at the Wordpress site We shall see I have moved my Blog to a Word Press site To see just how it would look in a different type of setting To streamline to pull back on sidebar stuff So I am looking for some feedback via e-mail or comment Which style of blog seems to fit what I am trying to do 
The Weds night hang is in flux Tomorrow is St Patty 's so we ll be steering clear of bars Plan tomorrow 5 45 pm meet at Polly Ju 6 pm Ride We ll ride the mi le trail south to miserable climb to Bernard / Highdrive then drop back down on the top trail to Polly Ju to land at Huck 's by 7pm This is all swoopy single track with some climbing The single track is easy but the bluff drop off can be distracting to newbies If you re not into the ride part then feel free and clear to meet at Huck 's Remember this is about hanging out and -talking- about bikes This whole riding thing is new to the Hang so all bike-talkers are always welcome Picture this A rad dude on a vintage Bridgestone MB-2 The MB-2 has been hacked into a single-speed There 's no unsightly chain tensioner Tight The rad dude is track standing in the front of a long line of traffic at a busy intersection waiting for a red light to turn He 's listening to 20 year-old rad punk music in his mp3 player It 's a sunny day and life is good And rad He 's aloof but ready to hammer off the line The light turns green and he lays into his pedals with all of the fury of his mi le-aged strength Bad Religion drowns out the POP his chain makes as it snaps His elegant chain line was the result of hours of filing grinding and chain-length fussing -- indeed he had to a and remove his half-chain-link a number of times as he tried different combinations of freewheel and chainring In the split second he slams his members into the top tube of his vintage steel he ponders the hackneyed phrase you re only as strong as your weakest link The phrase as it turns out does make some sense Cars move around him perplexed drivers staring Another cyclists rides by and says something the rad dude can t hear Was it that didn t look good By now the top-tube has made clear it 's immovable cold steel resolve upon the rad dude 's groin Tears well up in the rad dude 's eyes as he picks up the chain and limps his bike to the side walk where he will call for a ride home for the second time With apologies to Lynyrd Skynyrd--if you re not familiar with the song you can check it out here --I offer up this for every cyclist riding in traffic Gimme Three Feet I was riding along My head stuck on this song Right wheel tracking in my lane When the cars in the mirror Brought on my greatest of fears They think passin bikes is a game They would brush by close As if they wanted to boast Of making three lanes from two Now I don t like to fight But this just isn t right And I 'm lookin out for you know who Oh won t you gimme three feet Gimme three feet drivers Gimme three feet and go around Gimme three feet Gimme three feet drivers And we make it home safe and sound I know that I 'm slow But we re sharing the road So please don t make me squirm Go ahead and zoom After you give me some room And I ll go back to hearing this earworm Hey there fellow With the truck painted yellow I pay my taxes too I know that you d be swayed If you and I would trade And this cyclist now was you So gimme three feet Gimme three feet drivers Gimme three feet and go around Gimme three feet Gimme three feet drivers And we make it home safe and sound I can already hear it playing Can t you Score I see lots of tools on the side of the road when I ride I ve stopped picking up channel lock pliers As we rode down Broadway this morning I saw this wrench in a flash as we passed It took me another 10 feet or so to process what I d seen All I knew is that whatever the wrench was it was metric Hells yeah A 8 mm /10 mm combo wrench How perfect is that I never find such obvious bikey tools like this I was thinking it was about the best road find one could hope for But the obvious holy grail of all bike finds would be the Hozan Rock Ring Wrench I hacked this out of Nate 's private fancy invite-only blog From our ride on Friday This is a great ride I think the last time I rode this was with Jason Sorry about the formatting -------------- East Temple Road Today 's half-century-plus took John Friday Ride newcomer Andrew Tom and I to a place where winter actually visited and still lingers I had a heavy sack of rain and warmth gear on my back but the promised rain never came except in spits It was much warmer than yesterday We did however meet with lots of wind and plenty of mud We started at the Scoop for coffee John was eager to get going We made our descent on Bernard and headed out Centenial Trail We climbed deadly Lehman Hill and made our way to Temple The climb up Temple is double-deadly but the views are great in all directions The guys waited for me to catch up on the hills At the top of the hill the eastside gravel road turns to dirt There was snow mud lots of water flowing The temp dropped in shaded protected parts of the road though there was little ice I walked some of the slipperiest sections but still managed to fall off the bike once in some snow (T he others rode the whole of it ) But the descent was a blast and the woods a beautiful place to be We stopped for some gas station food by Newman Lake and I took a look at my shoes under the table Heh The ride home back on CT was up tempo into the wind That section of the CT is pretty on the river side but bleak on the other I was getting tired Tom and I high-fived when my odometer hit 50 then again when his turned 50 a mile later By the time I got home I was at 57 1 my longest single ride of the year so far Click for big Before I begin any postings about where or what I ride I d like to introduce myself Some of you may know me In fact I 's eem to be everywhere You see I may very well be you Or you may be me I 'm ( we re ) the person that loves to bike Yet it 's often too cold wet or far We re in a hurry or there 's a meeting we need to look nice for Or -insert reason not to ride here- When we do get on the bike we realize how much we like it How much freedom it provides and how good it makes us feel But the neighbors dog scares me I ll ride tomorrow So here 's the deal Beginning tomorrow Saturday March 13th I will ride every day for 42 days It may be a long ride more likely it ll be a short one No excuses Gotta work a 24-hour shift at the Fire Department Too bad Ride to work in the morning and home the next day Heck that 's two days right there Each day will be blogged about on my personal site ( which is even more stale than my bike riding ) Send me a personal e-mail at ffemtjacque at gmail dot com if you need the a ress The really cool rides I ll post here with pictures In an effort to keep this post short that 's all I really have to say I 'm me and very well may be you Let 's stop making excuses and ride Till later Who Loves Ya Oh this is why 42 days --Edit-- Does anyone have a mileage computer I can borrow for this I d like to track my daily mileage I ll return it after the 42-days --Edit 2-- Thanks for all the responses and support I ve got a computer to track miles and look forward to some rides with ya ll This just in Shimano has gone back to their original 2-strap sandal style for the 2010 version Hallelujah I ve carried on endlessly about the demise of the 2-strap Shimano sandals on this blog And then there 's the Keen Commuter woes Everytime I talk sandals I fear the wrath of BSNYC or his / her followers but I am proud to speak for the wool-sock-with-sandal-wearing nerds of Fredom Thank you

Merry Christmas Everyone I sure hope you had a great Christmas I know I did Each year it seems to get better and better I was very pleased with how well our Christmas Eve Operation went last night given all of the unexpected challenges We ended up with 100 % delivery success and initial polls show that overall satisfaction was around 97 % That 's up about 4 % from last year ( note last year was actually the lowest we have had since the 1940s ) and back within our historically normal range It was a very pleasant Christmas for me It took us about 3 hours after I landed back at the North Pole to wind down the operations Mrs Claus and I then had brunch together at the house Some of the elves were kind enough to prepare it for us so that neither one of us had to cook it was very nice of them After brunch Mrs Claus and I both took a 4 hour nap We awoke around 2pm NPT but only because I had set the alarm Its a good thing I did because we had to get up and prepare Christmas dinner We invited about a dozen of our closest friends over for dinner It 's nothing fancy but its one of my favorite things about the season we ( read Mrs Claus ) make good food its a great atmosphere and we share laughs with good friends We just use the dining room but on Christmas with the dining room tree ( it 's a 10-footer decorated with multi-color lights and hand-made ornaments we have received as gifts from children all over the world every country is represented ) glowing tens of candles flickering and the floor-to-ceiling windows revealing the snowy scene outside and a huge fire roaring in the stone fireplace the atmosphere was hard to beat We sat for hours after dinner drinking coffee sharing memories and making plans for the future I hope all of you had a chance to connect with friends and family the way Mrs Claus and I were able to tonight After everyone left and Mrs Claus went to bed I retired to the den and took a seat in my recliner I turned all the lights off except the Christmas tree lights and the lights in the garland that draped all the windows The fire was burning low in the fireplace and about a dozen candles on the mantle were lit I started to turn the TV on but then decided not to instead I turned on the sound system and tuned the satellite radio to the Christmas music channel I grabbed one last cup of Christmas Blend coffee ( I won t drink anymore until next year ) and settled in my recliner I just sat there and enjoyed the moment soaking in every last precious moment of Christmas I didn t think about old memories or make plans for the future I was just truly in the moment I don t know about you but its rare I do that I am always thinking about what 's next two three four moves down the road I don t think much about the past other than to consider what I can learn from it but thinking about what 's next often keeps me out of the moment So tonight was special It is something I need to apply more often If you haven t taken time to just sit and enjoy a quiet still moment during this very special even magical time of year I encourage you to do so You will be amazed at the pure joy it provides It 's time now for me to hit the hay It 's been an amazing run to and through Christmas this year As we close this season I want you to know how much I appreciate all of you I hope that my role as Santa Claus serves to provide you with joy hope and belief I pray the spirit of Christmas and its true meaning will be with you through out the year ahead May God bless you and all of your loved ones Merry Christmas to all and to all a very blessed night Love Santa and to all a Good Night The last presents have been delivered the last cookie eaten the last glass of milk consumed and the last stocking filled I just recieved the All Clear 's ignal from the North Pole Headquarters We are pointing the sleigh due north and returning home I hope everyone has had as much fun this Christmas Eve as I have had tonight Tomorrow is going to be the best Christmas yet I will not update my log until late in the day to day as I plan on enjoying Christmas brunch with Mrs Claus and taking a nap Good night all And she shall bring forth a Son and thou shalt call His name JESUS for He shall save His people from their sins - Matthew 1 21 I am just entering Alaska It feels like being back home at the North Pole Talk about cold Brrr I am still behind schedule but we will easily finish our work this evening before the sunrises and kids wake up It 's been a good night even with a few unexpected challenges along the way From here I will head south to the Hawaiian Islands I ll make a few stops between but I can shed the jacket for a few minutes and swap out my Starbucks Christmas blend coffee for some 100 % Kona coffee while I 'm cruising through the Islands I love it down there Mrs Claus and I will be back in the Islands for our annual vacation in a little more than a week Can t wait To all of you now awake across Europe Asia Africa amp Australia / Oceania Merry Christmas I am still tracking behind schedule but the weather is much much better I am currently in the Damascus Oregon area after spending some time in western Canada Once again this year I spent a little extra time in Vancouver BC with a little girl I know that is fighting cancer as well I ll spend time with her sister as well Regrettably I can t let them see me but I am so proud of both of them that I want to take a little time and make sure they are tucked in and sleeping well It was a tough year for both of them as there were a itional follow-up surgeries Life seems to be a roller coaster when you are battling something like this All I can say is that I really admire the entire family for how they handle this along with all the other challenges life brings us It is not easy but they are doing it Day to day they are making life go on As I said last year I never cease to be amazed by the strength and character of children that face cancer They are wise amp strong beyond their years And they are truly an inspiration to me Its well worth spending a few extra minutes with them I have deliveries to make so I 'm going to sign-off for now I ll post again soon I am behind schedule and experiencing some technical difficulties as I move towards the west coast I have crossed the Rocky Mountain range in North America and am experiencing much better weather conditions however due to the storm across the mid-western United States I am about an hour behind where I would like to be The weather in the midwestern United States is very challenging right now We are approximately 30 minutes behind schedule already The reindeer are having to work very hard as we press against gusting headwinds Its been very difficult to control the sleigh I am carrying a fraction of the normal payload or otherwise I don t believe we could keep this thing in the air On the ground due to the sheets of ice we are having to land in front yards and on neighborhood roads and have me hike ( with a pair of crampons on my boots ) up to and into the houses The winds are almost blowing me sideways and snow is falling at the rate of about half a foot an hour where I am at currently We ll be headed back for yet another replenishment stop here in a minute With the lighter load maximums we are having to stop many more times than normal The reindeer are looking forward to the break though as they are working hard Ok kids I might be a bit behind schedule and I might have a few challenges but I am - without question - coming to town So get to bed Oh one last note given the weather my posts may be a bit delayed and not just because of technology issues but also because I am going to be largely pre-occupied with navigating this storm surviving the night and finishing my deliveries Don t worry if there is a bit of delay I am ok No not THAT one Elvis I am currently looking down at the blue lights of Graceland What a beautiful sight But I can t look too long we have to clear this airspace quickly And that is going to be challening given the current weather conditions This has already been a very difficult night I anticipate it only growing more challenging as I head into the heart of the storm Our friends at FedEx are holding their routes so that we can deliver our presents across the Memphis metro area I ll be zig-zagging across from Lakeland TN to Hernando MS over the next hour or so I need to stay on time so that I can clear the airspace and let our partners at FedEx ( we do a lot of business with them they help with distribution from our North Pole China amp India production facilities to our replenishment centers ) get back in the air We definitely don t want them missing their deliveries So kids if you live in the mid-South of the United States its time to get to bed The weather is nice here in Miami Unfortunately I can t stay very long I will be headed west and into the storm pretty soon As you know I am constantly getting updates from the North Pole Headquarters I regret to tell you that once again this year almost a 100 a resses have been removed from my list of places to stop The Naughty amp Nice list is changing even as we speak Kids - please make sure you are behaving your parents tonight You don t want your a ress to be removed from my list I ll post again soon 
I have been trying to find the full text of Toyota 's apology for the safety problem that has finally resulted in a massive recall of their vehicles for repair of their accelerators nbsp Sadly I fear the full text nbsp consists of this I offer my apologies for the worries Akio Toyoda said Many customers are wondering whether their cars are OK nbsp This is shockingly inadequate as so may apologies these days are nbsp This lays the problem entirely on nbsp the consumer -- consumer worries and wondering whether their cars are OK not on Toyota 's manufacturing defective cars and its failure to respond immediately to the problem once it was brought to their attention This is like the ubiquitous If I have offended you by my saying that you are a fat cow I am sorry nbsp This sort of aplogy does not apologize for calling the person a fat cow but for offending him or her which is entirely different and is consistent with the idea that the listener 's being offended is his or her problem not the speaker 's problem nbsp Mr Toyoda could have sai dI am sorry that we made defective cars and put your lives in jeopardy but he didn t nbsp What is worse we have here a classic example of too little too late nbsp State Farm reported the problem to the NHTSA in 2007 nbsp Even more disturbing is the fact that NHTSA was getting complaints about acceleration problems in Toyotas in 2003 I have to believe Toyota was the first to know about it but chose to put its head in the sand nbsp The recall is going to cost 900 million by one estimate nbsp And they are losing something like 1 55 million per week in sales nbsp No wonder putting their heads in the sand seemed attractive I own a 12-13 year old Toyota pick up that has served me well nbsp And my wife has a Rav4 nbsp She is a little concerned that she will have accelerator problems nbsp Her fears are due entirely to the fact that Toyota has been totally unforthcoming about exactly what cars made when are vulnerable to the problem My wife and I just finished watching Alan Alda 's PBS thing on the human spark nbsp He 's a smart guy and funny but what was he thinking when he endorsed the notion that there is a human spark nbsp And what were these Harvard and Oxford and other scientists thinking I have had some experience with media sorts and they are very fond of hooks that one can use to snag an audience and keep it nbsp The hook this time is the notion of a human spark -- something we have but that chimps and no other species ( on this planet ) have nbsp This is a terrible metaphor nbsp We know that it takes a spark to ignite gasoline fumes in an automobile cylinder and that this is the most proximate cause of the piston 's moving downward thereby assisting the engine in its effort to nbsp I don t want to get into automobile stuff nbsp I would be way out of my depth nbsp However I am inclined to think that the evolution of those human qualities that distinguish us from chimps and other life forms might be just a bit more complicated than this metaphor makes it out to be The terrible thing about this metaphor is that it works better for 's ophisticated intelligent design people than for Darwinists nbsp If intelligent design people are willing to concede that we and the chimps have a common origin they need only then say Aha Alda is with us nbsp We are the life forms god sparked into humanhood by causing us to be capable of forming complex intentions recognizing complex intentions in others and imagining future actions nbsp Unsophisticated intelligent design people need only say that God dropped us on the planet pre-sparked The show actually admitted that chimps are capable of forming intentions and recognizing intentions in others ( but not as well as we do ) nbsp About the future they don t seem to think too much but to suppose they can t think about the immediate future is absurd nbsp Indeed the show proved otherwise as when it was argued that alpha males may choose to share with females based on attempting to curry favor with them nbsp Back in the day when I followed research on chimp linguistic development I formed the view that the researchers who did this work were not always the sharpest academic tacks nbsp In my view they tended to be so empathetic with their research subjects that they were willing to think things that just might not be true In the show the human spark seemed to be whatever 's parked the conjoint abilities to read other 's minds and travel in time as Alda put it nbsp Let me show you a picture they showed of the areas of the brain that light up when these two abilities are activated nbsp Notice that these two parts of the brain are not adjacent nbsp Two questions arise in my mind how did a single spark ignite abilities requiring two different parts of the brain to be be realized and how is it that so much of one part of the brain manage to be recruited for this realization Perhaps I am being a bit too simplistic here but I am not at all sure that these two abilities are so different nbsp If a crucial feature of humans one shared by chimps is our socialization then thinking about the future -- making plans for the future -- must crucially have involved making plans in connection with others nbsp And making plans in connection with others would seem to require an ability to form views as to others intentions nbsp A Harvard professor did note that both abilities involve escaping one 's present point of view nbsp I can imagine that being able to escape one 's present point of view could have been a precursor to the gradual evolving of these abilities over a very long time Spoiler Alert -- Do not read if you haven t seen but plan to see Avatar I was directed by a tweet to an story in the Japan Times on line saying that a small but vocal minority of people believe that Avatar is racist First the phrase 's mall but vocal wants to be looked at What it may mean is that there are two or three people who are extremely talkative who believe this This article begins Near the end of the hit film Avatar the villain snarls at the hero Both men are white although the hero is inhabiting a blue-skinned 2 75-meter-tall long-tailed alien How does it feel to betray your own race This is funny nbsp The avatar is no longer an avatar whose brain is being controlled by a white man lying in a device that facilitates this control but is instead a Na vi man if someone in a manufactured Na vi body whose human brain has been transferred into this body can be said to be a Na vi person The nbsp insulter nbsp should have sai dHow does it feel to betray your former race One idiot promoting this thesis says The ethnic Na vi he writes need the White man to save them because as a less developed race they lack the intelligence and fortitude to overcome their adversaries by themselves This is so inaccurate I have to believe the author did not see the movie or is incapable of seeing what is in front of his face The Na vi defeated the white devils thanks to Jake 's knowledge of the white devil 's military hardware and tactics and the intelligence and fortitude of the Na vi and the assistance of other inhabitants of Pandora nbsp Far from lacking fortitude the Na vi threw themselves into battle without regard for their personal safety Jake 's nbsp growing understanding of the Pandoran ecosystem played a critical role as well in that he ( quite literally ) plugged into the ecosystem seeking it to intercede on behalf of the planet Had he not become an authentic Na vi in spirit that intercession would not have worked James Cameron set himself up for this criticism by using a white actor to play Jake and a person of color to play the Na vi princess he fell in love with Had he simply used an African American or English speaking African our critics would be in a hell of a position It would no longer be a white man saving the blue-colored people but a person of color saving a person of a different color but it would still be a human rescuing the people of Avatar So at the worst Cameron 's mistake was he cast a White man in the role of Jake nbsp Casting a white man made economic sense I suppose but it isn t just white people who save others in movies nbsp Will Smith saved the planet in one movie and I understand that Denzel Washington saves the planet in a new nbsp movie nbsp I haven t yet seen I am so tired of people playing the race card I want to vomit all over this blog I got into the civil rights movement back in 1960 when it was a serious business because African Americans were denied most basic human rights in the South including Texas and Oklahoma as well as other places The change over these 50 years has been stunning And guess what A lot of white people worked alongside African Americans to make the civil rights revolution happen The lesson from that time is that when there is injustice everyone is obligated to do his or her part That is the lesson of Pandora The three white people who controlled the Avatars as spies all got religion and did what they could to help the Na vi defeat the occupying army nbsp It is a good thing when people of any color assist people of any color nbsp The Haitian relief effort is a prime case nbsp Is that relief effort racist because white people are helping persons of color When I first saw a TV advertisement for the myTouch telephone I thought instantly of the iTouch which as I understand it is an iPhone without the phone app ( I have never held either in my hands and have only seen the former in anyone else 's ) nbsp And having spent a few years working occasionally on the linguistic side of nbsp trademark law I wondered if Apple did not have a case for trademark infringement nbsp One of the tests is that the new mark evoke the notion that the product it identifies might have the same origin as the product identified by the earlier mark nbsp If surveys were to demonstrate that a significant proportion of consumers share my perception Apple would be a major step forward toward proving its case A case for infringement would have to consider the similarity of the marks They are of course very similar We have in the case of iTouch a lower case i followed by the word Touch and in the case of 'm yTouch we have a lower case 'm y followed by the same word The letter i when capitalized and only when capitalized refers to the person speaking or writing something Here though it is not capitalized In the case of 'm y we have a word that refers to the speaker / writer of something or in the case of 'm yTouch the owner / user One thing is clear the i of iMac or iPod or iTunes or or iPhone is normally not intepreted as referring to the owner / user In fact when the iMac was first introduced Steve Jobs claimed (s ee the title link ) The iMac comes from the marriage of the excitement of the internet with the simplicity of Macintosh He went on to say that it was designed with the fact that the primary use people wanted a personal computer for was to get onto the internet Jobs cited a set of i -words that he wanted to associate with the iMac namely internet individual instruct inform inspire Therefore the voice of he creator provides compelling evidence that there is no semantic connection between the i of iTouch and the 'm y of 'm yTouch nbsp When he associates the iMac with these other i -words he severs the relationship between i and the owner / user more completely even though one of these words is individual nbsp Note nbsp that this word is not equivalent in meaning to personal nbsp In fact the iMac was and is used in environments in which many individuals use a particular machine The fact that the lower case prefix i is attached to a wide range of products distributed by Apple argues for it having only the meaning a product distributed by Apple Originally this i primarily referred to the internet though Jobs a ed some other associations But the iPod breaks this connection Apple crated iTunes in the hope that people would buy music using iTunes and then downloading it onto their iPods That would involve internet connectivity However one could use an iPod without ever connecting it to a a program that connected to the internet by simply ripping one 's own or a friend 's music and converting it to a format the iPod could read and downloading it directly It is clear that there is a significant morphological similarity between iTouch and 'm yTouch for they share a morpheme However the first has a prefix that refers to the internet primarily but also to other things or just signifies that the product is made by Apple and the other has a prefix that refers to the owner / user In a ition to the morphological similarity between iTouch and 'm yTouch thre is an enormous overlap in product function nbsp In fact the only substantive difference is that the iTouch cannot be used to make calls So Apple would find it difficult to keep HTC and T-Moble from using the mark 'm yTouch Nevertheless as I said I suspect a survey of consumers aware of the nbsp iTouch confronted with this new product nbsp would connect 'm yTouch to iTouch and thereby to Apple At the very least HTC would seem to be ripping off some of Apple 's market good will I am not a trademark lawyer but I think that is a no no This evening I caught the tail end of a Zale 's commercial exclaiming The more you spend the more you save nbsp Contrast that with A penny saved is a penny earned nbsp Neither actually makes any sense except for the fact that if you do save a penny on day 1 then on day 2 it is as if you earned a penny on day 1 though of course you didn t nbsp The Zale 's ad is even stupider which is troubling for it presumes ( as is true for many people I fear ) that people will be so seduced by the combination of the gratifying concept of spending -- don t we all love to spend -- and the comforting concept of saving to rush to Zale 's nbsp to buy diamonds nbsp However trust me if you go by Ben Franklin 's adage on day 1 you will have more money on day 2 than if you abide by Zale 's At the Zale 's web site linked to the title of this blog you get a bit different version of this promotional scheme namely the more you buy the more you save nbsp Notice that these two claims are linguistically different nbsp We spend money to buy things nbsp However what the web site offers is savings in proportion to how much you spend not how many things you buy nbsp According to Zale 's if you spend 250- 449 you save 25 dollars nbsp Clearly the smart shopper would spend just 250 and get thereby a 10 % reduction nbsp If he or she were to spend 449 he or she would get a tiny bit more than 5 % nbsp If he or she spends 500 to 999 he or she wold get 50 back which offers the same percentage reduction / savings Offers scale upward from the lowest level of spending upward to a maximum of 1 000 if you spend 5 000 or more nbsp Notice that spending 5 000 gets you a savings of 25 % nbsp Wow what a deal nbsp The problem is that if you stayed out of Zale 's and did not spend 250 there on day 1 you would still have 250 on day 2 but if you spend that 250 you would be down 225 nbsp So spending money at Zale 's doesn t save you money unless you are determined to spend 250 and don t go to a store that gives you a better break nbsp In short while a penny saved may not be a penny earned a penny spent is definitely neither a penny earned nor a penny saved I am lucky nbsp My wife has never demanded or even hinted she wanted diamonds or any other kind of pricey jewelry nbsp I think I did once buy some pearl stud earrings in a fit of romantic fervor nbsp but that would have been a long time ago nbsp I suggest to men that they flee from any woman who really really wants jewelry other than say an engagement ring nbsp My wife and I got married with no engagement ring and no we ing rings but when we went to Scotland for a couple of months the next Summer we had a craft jeweler make us matching we ing rings nbsp I suppose that made us legal nbsp It sure made my mother-in-law happier nbsp It is possible to spend money on other probably more sensible things An Israeli linguist seems to think she has turned the linguistic world upside down with her new meaning for the word 'm ost nbsp A UPN article states Professor Mira Ariel of Tel Aviv University says her research is quite shocking for the linguistics world and proves some of her fellow linguists are wrong in their definition of the word 'm ost She claims that we linguists believe that 'm ost generally means 51 percent to 99 percent of a group of people or objects but that in a survey she and her colleagues did a number of persons understood 'm ost to mean about 80 percent to 95 percent of a group and not the much larger range of 51 percent to 99 percent One very serious problem with her claims is that no self-respecting linguist would ever say that 'm ost 'm eans 51 percent to 99 percent of a group or means 80 percent to 95 percent of a group nbsp This is just now how we use the word 'm ean Professor Ariel seems not to understand the distinction between 'm eaning and use nbsp It very well may be that people use 'm ost in a proposition like Most Ps are Q in circumstances in which 80-95 % of the relevant Ps have the property Q nbsp But that is not what it means nbsp That is how we use it nbsp I am not sure how to characterize what it means but I am sure that that is not what it means If I say that most Ps are Q and it turns out that 97 % of the Ps are Q is what I said false nbsp Surely not And if it turns out that 75 % of the Ps are Q is what I said false nbsp Again surely not nbsp This may not be how people generally use 'm ost but the meaning of 'm ost whatever it is is consistent with these two claims being true and so long as that is true then we can be sure that Professor Ariel is wrong about what 'm ost 'm eans After Obama was inaugurated he made himself excessively visible nbsp Anyone in show business knows that you always leave them wanting more nbsp The problem is that Obama kept himself front and center shoiwing up on TV virtually every day nbsp Before we had time to want to see him again there he was announcing this or that new appointment putting forth this or that new policy or giving an interview nbsp As a result Obama fatigue has set in and that has left him very vulnerable to the lies being told by the health industry about his and the Democratic Congressional health care bill Fox News and whoever else feels animus toward him including especially those who harbor ill-feeling toward African Americans Naturally the Antis will say they are pure of thought and that their objections to Obama are based on his actions as well as his apparent inaction nbsp The Rasmussen Report s don t bear them out Seventy-four percent (74%) of African-Americans Strongly Approve along with just 19 % of white voters (s ee other recent demographic highlights from the tracking poll ) Among all voters just 34 % now give the President good or excellent marks on his handling of the economy while 47 % say he is doing a poor job in that arena On national security issues 42 % say good or excellent while 41 % say poor Sixty-three percent (63%) of voters believe that political correctness kept the military from preventing the Fort Hood shootings nbsp So what we see is a striking division between Blacks and Whites as to how he is doing which is a bit of a give away that racial attitudes are coloring perceptions nbsp That sort of thing didn t keep him from being elected but given the continued high unemployment and many other issues he is guarnteed not to have a second term nbsp As James Carville famously sai dIt 's the economy stupid The last of these three items is especially interesting nbsp It is clear that the military knew that Major Hasan was a Muslim and that he was disgruntled nbsp Naturally in a country Bush poisoned with his constant drumbeat of 9 /11 9 /11 9 /11 9 /11 9 /11 9 /11 9 /11 etc and given the disposition of people to posit conspiracies wherever they see something they don t understand right-wingers and various and sundry other nutcases are sure this was part of a terrorist plot Conspiracy theories are the refuge of those who have agendas or are laboring in ignorance nbsp I recall the theories graduate students had about admissions policies in my university department nbsp Early on we used nbsp a Master 's exam to help determine who would be admitted to the Doctoral progrm nbsp nbsp A minority would not be admitted and the theory emerged that we had a quota never mind that limiting the number of students we admitted actually hurt the department economically I first encountered the theory that Major Hasan 's actions were the result of a terrorist plot on the Dennis Miller show and that political correctness the bane of right wing was in full flower in this case nbsp I was rather surprised nbsp Naturally the military is reluctant to jump to the view that Hasan was acting out of an anti-American or anti-military political stance nbsp That would be beyond stupid bordering on being imbecilic Not so the right wing in America tells us nbsp At Right Pundits we find Why are we able to so easily label Malik Nadal Hasan a terrorist The fact speaks for itself He is just as much a domestic terrorist as Timothy McVeigh was labeled so for his heinous act in Oklahoma City And while McVeigh perpetuated his act from afar in silence Malik Nadal Hasan shouted anti-American political views at his victims as he mowed them down with automatic weapons nbsp The first thing I learned about Major Hasan is that he really really really didn t want to go to Iraq nbsp The military is not disposed to worry overmuch about where soldiers do and do not want to be posted but they probably should in some cases nbsp This would have been one The title of this article is Malik Nadal Hasan Muslim Terrorist Challenges Obama 's Timidity nbsp I suppose this could be more misleading but I don t know how nbsp I seriously doubt that Obama told the military how it should go about its investigation or how it should present the facts to the public nbsp Nevertheless Obama is vulnerable to any attack on anything American by any Muslim nbsp Its a right wing freebie Obama neeeds to do the following by next year at this time 1 Get the health care bill in place 2 nbsp Somehow get unemployment to turn around nbsp I can think of some ways -- how about using unemployment benefits as subsidies to businesses who hire the uneployed for a year say 3 nbsp Get the hell out of Iraq 4 nbsp Render Al Queda and the Talliban totally impotent If he does 1 and 2 it is possible that he will get a second term nbsp If he does 1-3 he will get one nbsp If he gets all four he will be elected President for Life Many years ago (1967 or so ) I bought a wonderful Yamaha 250 cc motorcycle the manual for which had this instruction for shifting gears Tachometer tells the moment to do Unfortunately the RPMs given for gear shiftng kept this very fast motorcycle operating a little slower than a motor scooter One evening I told a friend who had ri en behind the original owner that the instructions couldn t be right and he offered to ride behind me and tell me when to shift He did not look at the tachometer He used his ears I suppose the manual could have said Ears tell the moment to do Once I got the pitch right I was golden I suspect that some junior executive at Yahama persuaded his bosses that his English was excellent and he could ably translate the manual On balance he didn t do badly Today I happend across a web site while hunting for information as to what might be down the line for Blackberry phones given the buzz surrounding the iPhone and the new Androd phones I came across this paragraph The Blackberry mobile phones are looking professionals and stylish mobile phone with can peoples are attract to this phone Blackberry is the smart phones which is the most popular in the world with its charming features It offers accessibility to an extensive variety of applications many wireless instruments across the world It provides accessibility to an extensive variety of applications on several wireless instruments across the globe by data and other services This piece of prose shocked me even more than that Yamaha manual This articale comes from Weblineindia a link to which is associated with the blog title That 's what 's shocking If I have prejudices in regard to India they are (1) Indians are very smart and very well-educated (2) Many if not most Indians know English either natively or fluently and (3) India has a bunch of great cuisines I clicked on the link and the first paragraph that popped up was this one Now a day ecommerce is a very popular among the internet users so what is Ecommerce People are habituated to sell and purchase their products or any types of items on the internet its called ecommerce and to online sell products you need ecommerce web So it only gets worse It is possible that these articles were written in some regional Indian language and run through some bad translating program More likely we are dealing with people who have big brains (s ee prejudice 1 above ) but smal English language

I don t feel like anyone 's ever really done it correctly he said A lot of times people use the same archetypes or other artists that would have been mentioned once in a one-sheet or something It 's not that it 's negative he says but is composed of tired comparisons that seem to be cobbled together in a hurry I mean there 's some shred of kinship there sonically but to say I sound like George Harrison does a disservice to George Harrison he said I don t do any of the number of things that people think of when they think of George Harrison I don t sing spiritual lyrics um I wasn t a Beatle And when the write-ups aren t about sonic comparison they re usually some form of genre-chicanery And so my music was commonly referred to as the least-freaky-of-the-freak-folk-people he said I always thought what I was doing was accessible and poppy Vetiver 3 7 10 Southgate House Newport KY courtesy of CincyGroove com Indeed Cabic is not a freak and he says he doesn t make folk music at least not on his last album He is a guy with a work ethic using his gifts At core of Vetiver are his voice and the songs he 's so carefully gestated Sometimes he spends a year tightening the arrangements around the track 's pop sensibility he said The tightly woven tracks make for a seamless performance that can feel orchestral if he 's playing with a cellist or downright raucous if he decides to go heavy on electric guitar Later that evening at his Southgate House performance about ninety audience members ( in a room that fits hundreds ) barely budged except for some heavy toe tapping and head no ing during Vetiver 's one long set As he played his songs Cabic 's mouth shoulders and eyebrows shrank and expanded in unison like he was a conduit for some larger force like he was expelling a grizzly bear 's soul from his somewhat slight frame Vetiver 3 7 10 Southgate House Newport KY courtesy of CincyGroove com His backing band surrounded him with energy and each song had an apex The sum total was like a well-written story with no errant sentences each song like a paragraph that drew me in delivered energy and then set me down right at the moment I was about to cave in to my urge to get up and dance It didn t take any pro ing for the relatively small but captive audience to make enough noise to invite them back on stage for a three-song encore during which at least a few people could be seen awkwardly trying to tug their friends out onto the empty dance floor MP3 Vetiver -

I ve got another book coming out from Quirk Books today The Sherlock Holmes Handbook The Methods and Mysteries of the World 's Greatest Detective by Ransom Riggs The book is full of interior illustrations and it 's a fun read for any fan of Arthur Conan Doyle 's most loved character Originally I was given the task of creating a look similar to the original Sidney Paget illustrations that appeared with the published stories but it was too daunting a task to handle Thankfully they were happy with the look I was able to provide and I think they conveyed the right atmosphere for this kind of subject matter This project required a lot of versatility in that I had to illustrate a variety of scenarios as well as objects and animals It was a fun challenge and I love the design of the book done by Doogie Horner over at Quirk it looks and feels like an old hardcover novel from the 19th century Here are some samples Sherlock experiencing a bit of malaise Sherlock Holmes exhibiting his skills in Bartistu A cane is not necessarily a sign of a handicap Move over Errol Flynn She ing a clever disguise The Hound of The Baskervilles The Victorian Opium Den as described in Holmes world The Baker Street Irregulars The avid beekeeper An accomplished violinist The demise of Professor Moriarty The good folks at Quirk books are coming up with another monster mash-Up book this September Sense and Sensibility and Sea Monsters It was a dream project to work on all the interior illustrations The beautiful cover art was created by Lars Leetaru This was a very rewarding project due to the fact that I was able to illustrate such a wide variety of cool miscellany sea monsters underwater sea bases giant pirates gynormous lobsters and intricate underwater diving suits It was pretty much the reason I became an illustrator Thankfully I can show two illustrations from the book which comes out September 15 Many praises must be given to Doogie Horner and Jason Rekulak for having faith in me to get the work done They gave me good direction and were enthusiastic about the artwork I showed them throughout the months it took to complete the title Click on the title link above to reserve your copy at Amazon As some of you know I haven t been the most ardent keeper of my blog There 's a number of explanations ( excuses ) I could pilfer from to explain my abscence-the biggest being my involvement in some book illustration projects i ve been entreched in for the past year A couple of them I can share with you some I can t Last year I was approached by Quirk Books with an offer to illustrate a new a ition to their Secret Lives series The Secret Lives of the Supreme Court It was easily the most extensive project I ve ever been involved in 35 two color illustrations + cover art With some luck and some patience from my enduring wife I was able to meet the deadlines and come out of it all unscathed Here 's a sample of some of my favorites from the series Antony Scalia Clarence Thomas Frank Murphy Harold Blackmun John Roberts Louis Brandeis Sandra Day O connor Thurgood Marshall William Howard Taft William Rehnquist William Brennan The process was pen and ink colored in Photoshop Looking at the work now I have mixed feelings about it I 'm proud of some of the illustrations and embarrassed by some of the others All in all that 's not a bad thing it 's good in some ways to feel a little unsatisfied only because it can push you to get better in the long run Many thanks to Doogie Horner at Quirk Books for guiding me through the whole process and pushing me creatively as well as campaigning on my behalf for the project And also many thanks to my wife Mary who put up with my long nights and my fuzzy sleep deprived brain for so many months Next up a peak at the cool Sherlock Holmes project I had the great fortune of working on Here 's a sketch for a personal illustration project I 'm working on updating my portfolio and decided to take on some projects that would get my butt in gear The concept for this illustration was kids who suffer from the heavy expectations of the adults in their lives Next up finished inks A rough sketch for a new illustration I ll post the various stages of development as I complete them I ve been lying really low for the past couple of months after having completed a large illustration assignment for a book that 's coming out in May of this year I ll post details about that project soon Now it 's time for me to crack the whip and get productive-It 's so easy to fall into the trap of doing nothing Howdy folks Where the F have I been you ask Well pretty much in my studio holed away working on a book illustration project which I can t divulge any details about yet But I do have a funny tale to tell y all about A few days ago I got an email from a fellow out in North Carolina who had a funny story to tell about an old drawing I did some years ago Here 's the skinny Hello Eugene I work for a major corporation and my job is in R amp D printing t-shirts Every now and then I get time to do some for myself and my friends Well a few weeks ago I decided to google some Tweedy pictures because one of my good friends bachelor party was coming up and we love Wilco Anyway I get to like page 30 on google images and there is your artwork It 's perfect for a t-shirt so I edited it and increased the resolution for printing ( about 300 dpi ) I put it on a shirt and give it to him and I thought that was the end of it Well weekend before last my friends were going to see Wilco in Charleston SC ( we live in NC ) and I couldn t go but my friend went and wore your shirt He worked his way to the front ( like he always does-that idiot ) and believe it or not he could tell Tweedy kept looking at him Then after a song Tweedy stops the show and says that is the most disgusting shirt I have ever seen That doesn t even look like me Kind of joking of course Then he plays another song and after that one he still can t let it go So he starts talking about it some more I look like the Geico caveman and my nose is bigger than that After another song he can t take it anymore so he helps my bu y onstage and asks the crowd what they think smiling the whole time He even tells my bu y to hold out the tshirt and then he puts his face beside it and asks the crowd Anyway he had a huge smile on his face the whole time My bu y ends up stopping the show for 5 minutes because of your artwork and he gives Tweedy a hug and shakes Nels Cline 's hand as well It made my bu y 's life Here is an excerpt from a local newspaper about it During the show Tweedy noticed a fan in the front row wearing a shirt with an image of the singer he found unflattering I look like the Geico caveman exclaimed Tweedy who proceeded to bring the fan onstage to model the image for the rest of the house Charleston News Story For some context here 's the image Time to get some new promotional materials out there I decided to create an image solely for the purpose of using it on a postcard Plus I needed a project to get me back on track with my work I 'm using a large format card for this design so I don t lose too much detail Here I go with yet another take on the Joker-figured it 's a good start to the new moleskine 
Kissinger warns of possible war of civilizations - Yahoo News WASHINGTON ( AFP ) - Former US secretary of state Henry Kissinger warned that Europe and the United States must unite to head off a war of civilizations arising from a nuclear-armed Mi le East In an opinion column in the Washington Post the renowned foreign policy expert said the potential for a global catastrophe dwarfed lingering transatlantic mistrust left over from the Iraq war A common Atlantic policy backed by moderate Arab states must become a top priority no matter how pessimistic previous experience with such projects leaves one Kissinger wrote The debate sparked by the Iraq war over American rashness vs European escapism is dwarfed by what the world now faces Both sides of the Atlantic should put their best minds together on how to deal with the common danger of a wider war merging into a war of civilizations against the background of a nuclear-armed Mi le East Kissinger wrote that the big threat lay in the erosion of nation states and the emergence of transnational groups Iran was at the centre of the challenge he said with its support for Hezbollah radical Shiite groups in Iraq and its nuclear program Washington must accept that many European nations were more optimistic about talks designed to convince Iran to halt uranium enrichment -- a process Tehran denies is aimed at making weapons he wrote Lining up to enrich uranium - Editorials amp Commentary - International Herald Tribune Never underestimate the potential for erratic policy when economic and political interests collide even when the policy involves preventing the spread of nuclear weapons This happened last month when in rapid succession Argentina Australia and South Africa joined a growing list of countries interested in enriching uranium for commercial purposes That is the same activity that Iran claims as its inalienable right and that the United States the European Union Russia and China insist must be halted in the interest of nonproliferation Is it fair or feasible to allow some countries to enrich uranium while attempting to prevent others from doing it The answer is not simple It turns on a number of technical economic and political considerations The technical dimension is most straightforward It pertains to the dual purpose of uranium enrichment to produce fuel for civilian reactors and explosive material for nuclear weapons It is not surprising therefore that most of the countries that have an active or latent uranium-enrichment industry also possess once made or tried to acquire nuclear weapons Today most of the arguments in support of new enrichment capacity are couched in economic terms generally linked to the buzz about major global expansion in nuclear energy Argentina Australia Brazil and South Africa for example portray their renewed interest in terms of projected domestic consumption and new export opportunities In fact current global enrichment capacity exceeds demand The projected boom in nuclear-energy development in most countries has yet to be matched by major new orders and the ability of newcomers to supplant the entrenched suppliers is problematic Moreover the financial costs of reviving antiquated and previously uneconomical enrichment facilities in Argentina and South Africa are likely to be enormous So other factors are at play Almost all the new and prospective entrants in the enrichment business appear anxious to establish their credentials as having existing technology in place Driving this process in part is the perception that all countries will soon be divided into uranium enrichment haves (s uppliers ) and have-nots ( customers ) under various proposals to establish multinational nuclear fuel centers and fuel-supply arrangements These proposals include President George W Bush 's call two years ago for the Nuclear Suppliers Group to refuse to sell enrichment technology to any state that did not already possess a full-scale functioning enrichment plant and the idea promoted about the same time by the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed ElBaradei for a five-year moratorium on new enrichment plants in order to buy time for developing more equitable means to ensure fuel supplies while stemming proliferation More recently the United States and Russia have proposed that a small set of countries would serve as enrichment providers while all others would forego such technology But the basis for becoming an approved enricher remains unclear While the United States opposes allowing Iran to enrich uranium Dennis Spurgeon the U S Assistant Secretary for Nuclear Energy recently said that 's pecial rules apply to Australia and Canada because they have the majority of economically recoverable uranium resources These rules appears founded more on political grounds that distinguish between allies and adversaries Such a policy of exceptionalism is at o 's with the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty It is also a recipe for failure as the history of U S -Iranian nuclear cooperation in the 1970s should make clear since today 's friend could become tomorrow 's foe There is no foolproof means of promoting peaceful nuclear energy while preventing the spread of nuclear weapons Perhaps the best way of resolving the conundrum is to provide inducements to all states that voluntarily forsake uranium enrichment These inducements should include guaranteed access to nuclear fuel for all states in good standing with the nonproliferation treaty - an approach that will be explored this month at a special IAEA conference in Vienna on Assurances of Fuel Supply and Nonproliferation To be effective these assurances will have to be nondiscriminatory and consistent with the nonproliferation treaty Such an approach will not guarantee an end to abuse of sensitive nuclear technology but it should reduce the number of states joining the uranium enrichment queue Charles D Ferguson is a fellow for science and technology at the Council on Foreign Relations William C Potter is director of the Center for Nonproliferation Studies at the Monterey Institute of International Studies They are the principal authors of The Four Faces of Nuclear Terrorism Never underestimate the potential for erratic policy when economic and political interests collide even when the policy involves preventing the spread of nuclear weapons This happened last month when in rapid succession Argentina Australia and South Africa joined a growing list of countries interested in enriching uranium for commercial purposes That is the same activity that Iran claims as its inalienable right and that the United States the European Union Russia and China insist must be halted in the interest of nonproliferation Is it fair or feasible to allow some countries to enrich uranium while attempting to prevent others from doing it The answer is not simple It turns on a number of technical economic and political considerations The technical dimension is most straightforward It pertains to the dual purpose of uranium enrichment to produce fuel for civilian reactors and explosive material for nuclear weapons It is not surprising therefore that most of the countries that have an active or latent uranium-enrichment industry also possess once made or tried to acquire nuclear weapons Today most of the arguments in support of new enrichment capacity are couched in economic terms generally linked to the buzz about major global expansion in nuclear energy Argentina Australia Brazil and South Africa for example portray their renewed interest in terms of projected domestic consumption and new export opportunities In fact current global enrichment capacity exceeds demand The projected boom in nuclear-energy development in most countries has yet to be matched by major new orders and the ability of newcomers to supplant the entrenched suppliers is problematic Iran Proposes Negotiations on Nuclear Stand-Off - washingtonpost com PARIS Sept 12 -- Iran has proposed extensive negotiations with Western powers to resolve the stand-off over its nuclear program but it is threatening to cut off talks and other cooperation if the case against it proceeds in the U N Security Council as advocated by the United States In a detailed and sometimes rambling response given to Western powers three weeks ago in reply to a set of proposals made by them last June Iran stops short of rejecting demands to halt its nuclear enrichment program saying the issue can be resolved in negotiations The response was made public on a Web site Tuesday HIR Understanding the US position ( Israel v Lebanon - 2006 ) As shown in this series Hezbollah is not a militia as much of the media would have you believe it is an antisemitic terrorist army of extermination 1 A year ago exactly the Philadelphia Inquirer explained the tremendous symbolic importance that Hezbollah has for the terrorist enemies of Israel Hezbollah now controls the south of Lebanon It is viewed throughout the region as the one armed Arab group that has defeated Israel by suicide bombers and guns because Hezbollah claims that Israel withdrew from Lebanon in 2000 chased out by Hezbollah 's terrorism 2 Consistent with this the same article explained that the United States labels Hezbollah a terrorist organization This -- in combination with the oft-repeated US claim to love and support Israel -- leads some to conclude that the United States ruling elite must be opposed to Hezbollah However government officials routinely conceal the truth with public statements -- we all know this Therefore the public statements of government officials are not a reliable guide for the social scientist Happily the social scientist can examine the foreign policy behaviors of states and in these behaviors the ruling elites that control state policy reveal their true values and goals To understand the US ruling elite 's real attitudes toward both Israel and Hezbollah then let us first take a look at how US officials have reacted to the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah in the past and then at how they are reacting this time The history ___________ A decade ago exactly in 1996 Hezbollah escalated dramatically its rocket attacks against Israeli civilians When Israel retaliated there were casualties including civilians at a UN base in Qana in southern Lebanon Consistent with the general anti-Israeli thrust of the media Israel rather than Hezbollah was blamed for this even though 1 ) it was Hezbollah that attacked first 2 ) it is Hezbollah that as a matter of principle targets civilians when it attacks and 3 ) Hezbollah had fired its rockets against Israeli civilians from a position close to the UN post thus drawing the errant Israeli artillery fire to the UN base 3 An ally of Israel would have blamed the terrorists who endanger both the civilians they attack and the civilians they hide among Instead the US used the worldwide diplomatic attack on Israel in order to produce a state of affairs that defies belief For 10 days Warren Christopher then the secretary of state bounced between Damascus Beirut and Jerusalem until he finally was able to get the 1996 cease-fire arrangement that restricted Israel and Hezbollah to fighting each other without terrorizing civilian populations 4 In other words a decade ago the United States went out of its way 1 ) to restrain Israel from crossing over and destroying Hezbollah and 2 ) to guarantee Hezbollah 's ability to attack Israel even though Hezbollah 's ideology as HIR has shown is simply to destroy the Jewish state through genocide 5 HIR Why Jewish patriots should thank Hezbollah ( Israel v Lebanon - 2006 ) Dear Readers I have seen much pessimism from Jewish patriots in the wake of the cease-fire that the United States and the United Nations have sought to impose in order to protect Hezbollah and which Israel 's leaders have accepted Many have characterized the result as one where Israel lost the war and they have lamented what they perceive as the damage to the earlier perception that Israel was invincible with negative consequences to the deterrence of Israel 's enemies My own view is less pessimistic It is certainly true that Ehud Olmert lost the war by agreeing to a cease-fire that like previous US and UN-brokered cease-fires in southern Lebanon will protect the antisemitic terrorists and allow them to re-arm But in my view Ehud Olmert was going to lose whatever war he was called upon to wage I don t think he is a patriot So the question for Jewish patriots is this Which war would you rather have Ehud Olmert lose Remember that Ehud Olmert was rushing to cleanse the Jews out of the West Bank -- like his mentor Ariel Sharon had done with the Jews who lived in Gaza -- in order to turn this territory over completely to the terrorists For those paying attention to geopolitical realities as opposed to the pro-Oslo propaganda statements of US and Israeli officials the probable outcome of Ehud Olmert 's policies was not difficult to foresee Relatively low-level but constant Hezbollah attacks from the north and PLO / Hamas attacks from Gaza in the south would have made the relocation of the evacuated West Bank Jews to the north and south of Israel impractical particularly given that a stream of Jews native to those areas would be fleeing the Hamas / Hezbollah attacks towards the relative safety of the Tel-Aviv-Yafo area ( as indeed many have now fled ) Tel-Aviv-Yafo already contains about half of all Israeli Jews and as a result of Olmert 's convergence and the terrorist attacks from north and south the Israeli Jews would have been further concentrated there Now the West Bank and Gaza according to a 1967 Pentagon study done immediately after the Six Day War are strategic territories that if relinquished will guarantee the destruction of Israel 1 This Pentagon study was not carried out for Israel 's benefit and Israel was not informed of its conclusions It was kept secret and made public only many years later because somebody filed suit to have it released under the Freedom of Information Act That the US ruling elite did not share with the Israelis its view of the vulnerability of the Jewish state but instead pressured Israel to participate in the Oslo process that has for purpose to hand over precisely these indispensable territories to the antisemitic terrorists is consistent with the entire history of US foreign policy towards the Jewish people and state which has been a constant sponsoring of Israel 's enemies and sabotaging of Israeli self-defense 2 USATODAY com - Iran to continue pursuing nuclear technology supreme leader says :\ TEHRAN Iran ( AP ) Iran 's supreme leader ( Emperor Darth Sidious ) Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Monday that Tehran will continue to pursue nuclear technology despite a U N Security Council deadline to suspend uranium enrichment by the end of the month or face the threat of economic and diplomatic sanctions The Islamic Republic of Iran has made its own decision and in the nuclear case God willing with patience and power will continue its path Khamenei was quoted as saying by state television He accused the United States of putting pressure on Iran despite Tehran 's assertions that its nuclear program was peaceful Arrogant powers and the U S are putting their utmost pressure on Iran while knowing Iran is not pursuing nuclear weapons he said Khamenei 's declaration came on the eve of Iran 's self-imposed Aug 22 deadline to respond to a Western incentives package for it to roll back its nuclear program Turkey halts Lebanon-bound aircraft from Iran Syria - Haaretz - Israel News :\ Turkish authorities have prevented five Iranian airplanes and a Syrian aircraft from flying into Lebanon suspecting them of transporting arms to Hezbollah Haaretz learned on Monday The Turkish Hurriyet newspaper reported on Monday that one of the aircraft that Turkish authorities forced to land at the Diyarbakir airport in eastern Turkey belongs to a private Iranian airline According to Hurriyet and other reports in Turkish media the aircraft was not allowed leave Diyarbakir for Lebanon after American intelligence reports indicated the plane carried three missile launchers and containers with Chinese C-802 land-to-sea missiles identical to the missile that hit an Israel Navy battleship in July The detained aircraft entered Turkish airspace after having been prevented from flying over Iraq Turkish authorities would not elaborate on whether these actions are part of a new policy But analysts believe that Ankara has acquiesced to American and Israeli requests to impose stricter surveillance on the passage of Iranian aircraft and their cargo Syria 's status in relation to the new surveillance procedures is still unclear Olmert rules out peace talks with Syria :\ KIRYAT SHEMONA Israel -- Prime Minister Ehud Olmert on Monday ruled out a resumption of negotiations with Syria at this time saying Damascus must first end its support for militant groups Olmert spoke just hours after a minister in his Cabinet urged a resumption of negotiations and said Israel should give back the Golan Heights in exchange for peace with Syria Israel accuses Syria and Iran of arming and supporting Lebanese Hezbollah guerrillas who fired nearly 4 000 rockets at Israel in the 34-day war that ended last week However during the war Israel went to great lengths to keep Syria out of the conflict apparently to avoid opening another front or closing future peace options After the war Syrian President Bashar Assad signaled he is moving closer to Iran He delivered a hardline speech in praise of Hezbollah and warned that future Arab generations might succeed with force where peace talks have failed so far - a reference to the Golan Heights the plateau Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast War By refusing to enter peace negotiations Olmert sends a distinct message to Syria He 's for war

At Creation Moments Ian Taylor starts by asking a scientific question about embryogenesis How do other cells know to hook up with each other to make our circulatory system or form the heart A very good question and one which is central evo-devo He then puts forward a hypothesis developed by William Dryer that olfactory receptors are responsible for cell-cell guidance An interesting hypothesis formed in part because you expresses these genes in nearly every cell of your body Please Mr Taylor tell us more about olfactory genes Mammals and humans have more than a thousand different olfactory genes Yes and more than half of yours are pseudogenes They are so far as we know non-functional and a waste of chromosomal space Awfully efficient that creator of yours One or another of these crisscrosses each of your cell seven times Whoa that is one huge protein Oh wait it crisscrosses the cell membrane seven times Minor error Well if you want to read more about olfactory receptors ( and actually learn something ) Larry Moran seems to like the subject But the good thing is that here is a hypothesis that can be tested So what have people found Um well this hypothesis doesn t have much evidence to support it From the journal article A claim that ectopic OR expression may be in part governed by neutral changes is supported by several findings First the divergence in the expression patterns of human-mouse orthologous OR pairs in ectopic tissues is similar to that of randomly selected pairs This observation generalizes a previously reported specific case for OR51E2 which was found to be over-expressed in human prostate 39 40 although minor expression could be detected also in brain Its mouse ortholog was found predominantly in brain and its rat ortholog in brain and liver 43 Second OR transcription was found here to be unbiased with respect to any particular OR subgroup in ectopic tissues ( except for the human 7E subfamily members see below ) as indicated by the approximate fit to a Poisson distribution We note though that other studies have reported up to 300-fold difference in the levels of ORs transcription in mouse olfactory epithelium 5 16 Last OR pseudogenes were found here to be expressed in ectopic tissues at similar levels to those of intact genes In contrast in olfactory epithelium where chemosensory functionality is expected OR pseudogenes were found to be significantly less expressed than intact genes 16 In short the expression of the olfactory receptors appears to be random when measured by tissue by species by receptor subgroup and by pseudogene vs functional gene That last one is important the genes that don t do anything are translated just as much as the the genes that do Maybe more work will turn up something but for now the expression appears to be just noise Not a big problem most hypothesis end up not working so I doubt that anyone is losing sleep over this Except maybe Mr Taylor ( from the original link ): If this hypothesis is so this system of knitting our unborn bodies together is an elegant and precise product of a loving Creator So does that mean that you now believe we aren t the product of a loving creator Maybe just the product of a spiteful creator You let me know Inane ramblings about science religion parenting et al I am bored from trying to fill out my NRSA application Enjoy Image via Epic Win FTW Inane ramblings about science religion parenting et al An oft heard comment on wingnut radio shows and the o tobacconist shop is that cigarette taxes aren t about health they are about money politicians don t want people to stop smoking because the state would lose revenue This is a bit hard to swallow since the strength of the connection between tobacco smoke inhalation and health is only slightly less than the strong nuclear force revenue from tobacco taxes have leveled off in the past decade and the IRS allows medical deductions for smoking cessation programs and prescriptions Sometimes it just isn t about the money Like say the neo-prohibitionists who run Pennsylvania 's liquor laws More than a dozen armed State Police officers conducted simultaneous raids last week on three popular Philadelphia bars known for their wide beer selections The cops confiscated hundreds of bottles of expensive ales and lagers now in State Police custody at an undisclosed location The alleged offense Although the bar owners had bought the beer legally from licensed Pennsylvania distributors and had paid all the necessary taxes the police claimed that nobody had registered the precise names of the beers with the state Liquor Control Board - a process that requires the brewers or their importers to pay a 75 registration fee for each product they want to sell in Pennsylvania Notice that this is not the fault of tavern owner it is the fault of the brewer / importer for not properly registering the beer But the tavern owners are the ones holding the bag They were raided not because they didn t pay taxes on the beer but because some of the beer wasn t officially approved Even though some of it was more than half the beer removed by the State Police was properly registered - but the cops couldn t find it on their lists because of clerical errors or blatant ineptitude between the police and the Liquor Control Board with whom the officers were conferring by telephone Pennsylvania has many archaic beer laws Though some legislators are trying to change them it is still easier for me to get a six-pack of Victory than someone who actually lives

the blog of Jennifer McGruther At NourishedKitchen she implemented a 28-day challenge to her readers for February eat nothing but real food From the CNN article On Day One of the challenge blogger Jennifer McGruther gave this instruction Purge your pantry of processed foods This meant everything with refined oils white flour sugar low- and skimmed-milk products margarine processed cheeses refined salt and dried pastas had to go I understand the white flour the bleaching process isn t necessary at all But skim milk Cheese How do you make unprocessed cheese Or sugar Unprocessed salt is simply impossible My dried pasta at home includes two ingredients whole wheat and water Does air drying it make it processed Then I read her o definition of processed foods Processed food is defined as any food that has undergone a change of character For example edamame would be unprocessed and tofu would be processed Ugh this is just a raw food diet that allows you to eat non-raw foods as long as you do it yourself In no way shape or form does that represent what I would consider to be the definition of real food - It 's because of extremists like this that some have a completely misconstrued notion of what a foodie is CNN don t give those of us who care about food a bad name Image via Wellesley College - So what is your definition Good question My non-specific answer would be food pretending to be something it is not Real cheese is made with milk and enzymes Fake cheese a 's oils flavor enhancers and preservatives That doesn t mean I don t eat fake foods it just means that I don t fool myself into thinking that Froot Loops are a totally awesome health food because now it is made with a little bit of whole grain wheat Inane ramblings about science religion parenting et al I really shouldn t be surprised that Ian Taylor gets his facts wrong but I am surprised when Ian Taylor outright lies Doesn t your religion have something to say about that First errors in fact concerning rings around planets For example we have learned that all five of the outer planets are surrounded by rings Now these transcripts are old so it is understandable that he would be including Pluto as a planet (1) But Pluto does not have rings At best there is the possibility that it may have rings based on computer models but there are no data supporting that possibility Sorry Ian you are just plain wrong The rings are only inches thick and comprised of dust and ice in neat bands No they are not inches thick Saturn 's rings are about 1 km thick in areas and the rings of Uranus exceed 100 m That 's not just off by a little that is off by 3-4 orders of magnitude That 's like hopping on a Southwest flight from Orlando to Phoenix and getting dropped of at Disneyworld Not to mention that some of those chunks of ice are several meters across by themselves and you get the idea that Mr Taylor doesn t know what the hell he is talking about Go on Every astronomer knows that the forces of the solar wind of gravity and the unavoidable laws of physics should have destroyed a planetary ring in less than a million years The rings are stable because of the laws of physics gravitational pull on objects within the Roche limit stops them from coalescing That 's why astronomers think the rings are very old probably as old as the solar system Now to the lying Mr Taylor has a comment about shepherding satellites But now an exhaustive study of Voyager 2 's data from Uranus has shown perfect rings without any 's hepherding satellites WTF The two confirmed shepherding satellites of Uranus Ophelia and Cordelia were discovered by Voyager 2 If only your attention to detail were as exhaustive Not only that Mr Taylor 's idea seems to come primarily from a letter to the editor in Science News (2) which cites the existence of the two shepherding moons I think Ian needs a fire extinguisher for his pants Image via Wikimedia Commons (1) Unless Mr Taylor was prescient and excluded Pluto But then he would be including Mars in the five outer planets and Mars doesn t have rings either (2) Sorry that link just shows the table of contents but a complete copy of the letter is below A number of researchers have suggested that the rings of Uranus -- compared with the solar system which has been around for some 4 6 billion years -- look relatively young perhaps less than a billion years old But scientists are traditionally suspicious of explanations whose validity depends on observations made exactly at some key moment How likely is it that the Voyager 2 spacecraft just happened to be around to photograph the rings during the short span when they existed An alternative theory from Larry Esposito of the University of Colorado at Boulder suggests the rings may not be young at all Instead he proposes their chunks keep grinding against one another in a way that continually creates new particles Without some such regenerative process to sustain them Esposito notes the Uranian rings as Voyager 2 saw them would be gone in a billion years or less Indeed many of the particles are so small that they would be dragged down to destruction in that time by the planet 's extended hydrogen atmosphere The motions and present locations of two small Uranian moons known as 's hepherd 's atellites -- believed to be keeping one of the rings as sharp-edged and narrow as it is -- suggest they have been doing so for only about that long A itional shepherds have been proposed for many of the other nine known Uranian rings though no one has yet identified any in existing photos Besides the main rings Voyager 2 's data also showed 50 to 100 tenuous dust bands containing smaller particles than the rings But Esposito says their different positions mean the bands cannot have come from the rings In a paper submitted to NATURE he instead proposes that the dust in the bands may have been generated by micrometeoroids colliding with unseen moonlets each about 200 meters across in belts some tens of kilometers wide as well as by collisions between the moonlets themselves Both the moonlet belt objects and the main rings of Uranus have been created by the breakup of larger objects he says Any dust or rings that existed billions of years ago would long since have been removed by atmospheric drag he says so some mechanism must be creating new dust In the solar system 's early history according to Esposito the material that later became the Uranian ring system may have consisted simply of perhaps 10 to 12 moons each about 200 kilometers across Since then the ring system has been in a continuing state of gradual evolution By J Eberhart Inane ramblings about science religion parenting et al Especially when they- do stupid shit like this Queen Antoinette 's

science religion parenting et al The habenula is a highly conserved structure in the vertebrate central nervous system It doesn t matter if you look at mammals reptiles or fish we all have it It seems to be a relay center in communication between the forebrain ( in mammals ) and a whole host of midbrain structures including the substantia nigra and raphe nuclei These are the dopaminergic and serotonergic centers of the brain So you can understand why some who study a iction schizophrenia and / or depression are turning their attention habenularly ( and if you don t understand follow those links ) In fact at least one case study points to deep brain stimulation of the lateral habenula as a potential therapy for treatment resistant depression While all vertebrates have a habenula they don t all look the same In a ition to showing profound lateralization the habenula of fish do not seem to separate into medial and lateral nuclei as they do in mammals However just because the gross anatomy is different doesn t mean that connectivity ( and function ) follows suit Amo et al (2010) hypothesized that because it is such a conserved structure habenula of the zebrafish would also show subdivisions based on connectivity This is basically a retrograde / anterograde tracing study Except instead of using peroxidase based stains they are using awesomely fluorescent compounds By injecting in the serotonergic centers of the zebrafish they found retrograde labeling clustered within the ventral habenula in mammals similar tracing studies would show labeling in the lateral habenula It is already known that the zebrafish dorsal habenula ( and mammalian medial habenula ) sends projections to the interpeduncular nucleus So it seems that the medial / lateral subdivision in mammals corresponds to a dorsal / ventral subdivision in zebrafish They also did an anterograde tracer to confirm this connection Plus as further confirmation in mammals the descending projections from the medial habenula form the core of the fasciculus retroflexus while the projections from the lateral habenula form the sheath Do the projections from the dorsal and ventral habenula of the zebrafish follow such a pattern I wouldn t be mentioning it if they didn t The green is GFP expressed in the dorsal habenula neurons while the navy blue is neurobiotin taken up retrogradely by ventral habenular neurons Neat stuff So now we know that the habenula of mammals and fish are homologous Why is this important One transgenic studies in mammals are kind of messy Sure there is lots of work being done on mice but the availability of other transgenic mammals is limited By contrast zebrafish may offer an alternative means of studying the functionality of habenular output through genetic manipulation (1) Two by identifying genes specific to the two habenular subdivisions the authors were able to look at the development of the habenula in zebrafish Turns out that the fish really do

In 1996 in Bob Cringely 's documentary Triumph of the Nerds Steve Jobs said Picasso had a saying he said good artists copy great artists steal We have you know always been shameless about stealing great ideas Here 's the video Today Apple 's press release says We can sit by and watch competitors steal our patented inventions or we can do something about it We ve decided to do something about it said Steve Jobs Apple 's CEO We think competition is healthy but competitors should create their own original technology not steal ours Apple has suffered through many patent trolls over the years and should understand how software patents limit innovation indeed their consistent position on supporting Open Source Codecs in HTML5 has been that they are afraid of patent lawsuits So this action can only be seen as an attack on innovation I wrote a post last year about Twitter theory and presented on it too so I thought I d compare how Google Buzz fits in with them or not Flow Buzz is a flow but it does show an unread count and it 's in your email inbox so the implicit pressure to read is there You re not cued to dip in and out Also all replies come to your main inbox privileging them over the flow from those you chose to follow Faces There are faces of people next to the root Buzzes taping into the subtle nuances of trust we all carry in our heads but not by the replies making those comments from strangers even more alien Phatic The phatic feel of Twitter is partially there but at the launch there was much talk of Google hiding the irrelevant so the social gestures where we groom each other may be tidied away by an uncomprehending machine The replies from faceless strangers flooding your inbox if you respond to anyone with a large following will put people off interacting socially The feeling of talking intimately to those you know is replaced by something closer to the naked in the school lunchroom nightmare Following Buzz does pick up Twitters asymmetric following model and indeed a 's a way to create private Buzzes for small groups both key features However these are undermined by the confusing editing process The Follower / Following editing is only in pop-up javascript dialogs on your Buzz in gmail and Google Profile pages and because of the auto-follow onboarding rather opaque The groups editing is in Google Contacts but that doesn t show the Followers Following Chat Friends Latitude or other subgroups There is also no way to see just conversations with those groups The overall effect makes it feel more like a Mornington Crescent server than Twitter I made a Mornington Crescent Buzz account it seems to fit Publics Twitter 's natural view is different for each of us and is of those we have chosen We each have our own public that we see and we a ress The subtlety is that the publics are semi-overlapping - not everyone we can see will hear us as they don t necessarily follow us and they may not dip into the stream in time to catch the evanescent ripples in the flow that our remark started To see responses to us from those we don t follow we have to click the Mentions tab However as our view is of those we choose to follow our emotional response is set by that and we behave more civilly in return Buzz reverses this The general comments from friends are in the Buzz tab but anyone can use @\ to mention you forcing the whole conversational thread into your inbox Similarly if you comment on someone else 's Buzz any further updates to the web show up in your main email inbox The tragedy of the comments ensues where annoying people can take over the discussion and their replies are privileged twice over those you choose to follow This is the YouTube comments problem yet magnified when all hear the words of one the conversation often decays Mutual media By bringing in Twitter blogs Google Reader shared items photos and other Activity Streams feeds Buzz has the potential to be a way to connect the loosely coupled flows those of us who live in the listening Web to the email dwellers who may left behind By each reading whom we choose to and passing on some of it to others we are each others media we are the synapses in the global brain of the web of thought and conversation Although we each only touch a local part of it ideas can travel a long way If the prioritisation of secondary commentary and poking over collated ideas can be reversed in Buzz this could be made to work Small world networks Social connections are a small-world network locally strongly-connected but spreading globally in a small number of jumps The email graph that Buzz taps into may be a worse model of real world social networks that articulated SNS 's like Facebook but it could be improved if the following and editing models are fixed Buzz 's promise is that it builds on Activity Streams and other open standards so it could help encourage others to do this better Mike Arrington wrote a plea for better social software on Sunday The online social landscape today sort of feels to me like search did in 1999 It 's a mess but we don t complain much about it because we don t know there 's a better way Everything is decentralized and no one is working to centralize stuff I ve got photos on Flickr Posterous and Facebook ( and even a few on MySpace ) reviews on Yelp ( but movie reviews on Flixster ) location on Foursquare Loopt and Gowalla status updates on Facebook and Twitter and videos on YouTube Etc I ve got dozens of social graphs on dozens of sites and trying to remember which friends puts his or her pictures on which site is a huge challenge What enabled Google to solve the search problem was a common standard for expressing pages and the links between them so that they could index the webpages and derive a metric for which ones were more important They didn t do this by replacing the web with a structured database that they curated they worked with the standards in use to make sense of it To solve the social conundrum we need the equivalent - agreed standards in widespread use so that we can generalize across sites Fortunately we have these We have OpenID and OAuth for delegated login we have XFN other microformats and Portable Contacts for public and private people connections we have Feeds and Activity Streams for translating social actions between sites This enabling social infrastructure means that we ll be able to have a new generation of sites that enhance our web experience through social filtering without our connections being centralised in a single company 's database Once we get used to the experience of being able to delegate login personal connections and activity updates we ll look askance at developers who insist we create yet another profile and invite all our friends by email to experience their site it ll be like a website without links What I wanted from the iPad a very high-pixel-density HD screen in a small device didn t happen But in the commentary of my techie colleagues like David Alex and Tim I 'm seeing another disappointment They re saying this isn t a computer like I grew up with It 's not the generative machine that can be bent to our will to do anything it 's a display device Now this is true but it reminds me of programmers complaining about the Web as opposed to native applications The Web is something that started out as a display medium but is now the platform we all expect to build our applications on precisely because it is an abstraction that comes between us and the particular hardware our users are running The web is an agreement on how to phrase things The iPad picks up this agreement and delivers on it in a new form but exceptionally well When the iPhone was launched I said that the web was the one standard even Steve Jobs can t ignore This is reinforced by the iPad - it opens with web browsing and the Book format adopted ePub is built on HTML I would prefer it if anyone could distribute native apps for the iPad but we all can create websites The big difference the iPhone brought and that the iPad builds on is the pervasive ability to zoom in and out easily I think that this will lead to a change in how we think about user experience with the deep zooming experience we are familar with from Google Maps and now Prezi becoming natural in more and more apps The chaps at Mozilla Christopher Blizzard and Robert O Callahan reopened the HTML5 lt audio gt and lt video gt debate yesterday with a spirited defence of their decision to support only the patent-unencumbered - Ogg format and Vorbis and Theora codecs in Firefox releases as part of their HTML5 support Now I understand their motives here - back when I was at Apple I spent a big chunk of time trying get permission to a support for Vorbis to QuickTime but didn t manage to get it past Apple management 's fears However all the browsers I use now claim to support HTML5 lt audio gt and lt video gt so I thought I d try it out I made some simple test pages using mp3 au and WAV files to see how they were supported What I found was a bit disappointing - it seems that the way that the spec is written you can support lt audio gt but no file formats or codecs at all ( my Droid does this ) and if you can t play the file you re not supposed to show the fallback HTML contents This means that Firefox Droid won t show the link to the audio file below Looking Up From Dystopia though browsers that don t support lt audio gt at all will Here 's the markup lt audio src = http // homepage mac com / kevinmarks / dystopia mp3 controls gt lt a href = http // homepage mac com / kevinmarks / dystopia mp3 type = audio / mpeg gt Looking Up From Dystopia lt / a gt lt / audio gt However if I use a direct link or an embe ed lt iframe gt Firefox will use available plugins to play the file ( both Flash and QuickTime happily play mp3 's ) Thus using lt audio gt give me less compatibility with current browsers On phone browsers o er things happen - iPhone gives a clickable button for the lt audio gt but auto-loads an lt iframe gt Droid ignroes iFrames Palm Pre doesn t have lt audio gt but lt iframe gt behaves like the iPhone Smarter behaviour with declarative audio would be nice here -Submarine patent trolls keeping periscopes down may exist Kevin Marks Originally uploaded by O Reilly Conferences Last week at Web2expo I gave a 10-minute keynote on the new vocabulary needed to understand where the web is going - most of this comes from sociology and anthropology If you ve been following my blog you ll recognise this inculdes ideas from my Twitter in Theory post from the Flow Past Web from one on Digital Publics and of course from the Tummler post Here 's the video And here 's the presentation which uses Prezi 's mindmap-as-presentation software This weekend Adam Penenberg wrote a post at Techcrunch Let 's Kill Viral It 's Time For a New Word in which after being ridiculed by radio hosts over the title of his book The Viral Loop he says The problem I think is the word viral which comes from biology and was retrofitted to cover the phenomenon of word-of-mouth or on the Web so-called word-of-mouse dissemination of ideas I propose we kill it and replace it with something better Now this is a topic I ve spoken and written about before but I think Adam is missing the point again As I said then if you behave like a disease people develop an immune system I don t think changing the name is enough - we need to change practice too Viruses are exploitative - they hijack normal reproduction to propagate their genes at the expense of the host This is an accurate metaphor for the kinds of scammy social applications that Mike Arrington described in his Scamville The Social Gaming Ecosystem Of Hell post this weekend aimed at the same app developers I was talking to originally in 2008 When I read Adam 's interview with Caterina Fake it was obvious that Caterina 's expert Tummling was key to Flickr 's growth and it didn t fit Adam 's Viral framing Caterina says But a game built for adults where communication could come more freely would mean the social interactions would be much more fruitful They also have this exchange Penenberg There 's both a good and bad side to virality Products with viral hooks that are so strong they coerce people to sign up--in order to achieve a huge initial viral rush--are obviously bad Not only do they alienate users they don t lead to a sustainable business On the good side you have organic growth which comes as a natural byproduct of something that spreads simply because people like it--eBay Hot or Not and Flickr I can t think of an antonym for it Fake How about brute force growth Penenberg That 's good Maybe we should trademark the term Clearly Adam is struggling with his stale metaphor here trying to come up with better terminiology When I mentioned this on twitter Caterina responded with Things on the internet grow fungally not virally The metaphor is completely wrong and I was a former member of the SF Mycological Society Mushrooms are the fruiting bodies of mycelia underground Which fits perfectly with my organic reproduction metaphors So lets keep the term viral for explotatative applications that violate trust to reproduce against the interests of their hosts and we can use organic terms like fruitful or if we insist on alliterative euphony virile videos fertile films and maybe even philoprogenitive photographs Almost 800 years ago in 1215 a group of Barons pinned King John down and got a written list of rights some of which are still British Law This week by contrast Baron Mandelson plans to revoke rights by government fiat Lets compare Magna Carta (20) For a trivial offence a free man shall be fined only in proportion to the degree of his offence and for a serious offence correspondingly but not so heavily as to deprive him of his livelihood In the same way a merchant shall be spared his merchandise and a villein the implements of his husbandry if they fall upon the mercy of a royal court None of these fines shall be imposed except by the assessment on oath of reputable men of the neighbourhood (38) In future no official shall place a man on trial upon his own unsupported statement without producing credible witnesses to the truth of it (39) No free man shall be seized or imprisoned or stripped of his rights or possessions or outlawed or exiled or deprived of his standing in any other way nor will we proceed with force against him or send others to do so except by the lawful judgement of his equals or by the law of the land (40) To no one will we sell to no one deny or delay right or justice (61) ]W e will not seek to procure from anyone either by our own efforts or those of a third party anything by which any part of these concessions or liberties might be revoked or diminished Should such a thing be procured it shall be null and void and we will at no time make use of it either ourselves or through a third party The Digital Economy Bill is not so clearly written but (1) This section applies if it appears to a copyright owner that ( a ) a subscriber to an internet access service has infringed the owner 's copyright by means of the service or ( b ) a subscriber to an internet access service has allowed another person to use the service and that other person has infringed the owner 's copyright by means of the service (2) The owner may make a copyright infringement report to the internet service provider who provided the internet access service if a code in force under section 124C or 124D ( an initial obligations code ) allows the owner to do so Which sounds like it 's own unsupported statement without producing credible witnesses to the truth of it to me 124H Obligations to limit internet access (1) The Secretary of State may at any time by order impose a technical obligation on internet service providers if the Secretary of State considers it appropriate in view of ( a ) an assessment carried out or steps taken by OFCOM under section 124G or ( b ) any other consideration Not lawful judgement of his equals or by the law of the land or proportional or assessment on oath of reputable men of the neighbourhood just any other consideration the Secretary of State feels like 302A Power to amend Part 1 and this Part (1) The Secretary of State may by order amend Part 1 or this Part for the purpose of preventing or reducing the infringement of copyright by means of the internet if it appears to the Secretary of State appropriate to do so having regard to technological developments that have occurred or are likely to occur (5) The power may be exercised so as to ( a ) confer a power or right or impose a duty on any person ( b ) modify or remove a power right or duty of any person ( c ) require a person to pay fees Again the Secretary of State can make anyone do anything or pay anything without due process

3lb loss In the past 5 years I think I ve only twice ever lost 3lbs in one week so this was a bit of a surprise But I have been on track and then some this week Last Thursday I went to see a Nutritionist who after looking through the detailed questionnaire I d filled out and testing me on her machine told me I most likely had a couple of mild food intolerances and too much yeast in my system which affects my digestion and ability to absorb the right nutrients thus either causing or contributing to my CFS The upshot of this is it has been recommended I cut out sugars yeast and fungi from my diet - this includes fruit juice dried fruits and many fresh fruits too as they are all high in sugar content - and take pro-biotics and Chromium supplements to allow my body to recover She didn t think I had full blown Candida but felt I was leaning that way so should look to a ress it I don t appear to have a wheat intolerance but can t have bread because of the yeast And it turns out the fungi thing means I can t have Quorn either which is a bit of a bugger as we lead a largely vegetarian diet and Quorn usually features once or twice a week It seems mostly I ll be following a GL diet which Maggie had been looking at anyway Am I certain this is all correct and not bullshit No You don t need a medical degree to call yourself a nutritionist and the vega machine she used to test me for my reactions to different food stuffs hasn t had full clinical trials However I 'm prepared to give it a go It looks a few stages more advanced than Crystal Therapy and I 'm not being recommended to do anything unhealthy or life threatening If it turns out to be complete bollocks then at least I won t have lost anything What this has meant is I now daren t snack on anything I shouldn t It 's no longer just a case of extra calories delaying or preventing weight loss but the wrong things can feed the yeast growth And if I 'm to give this a shot then I ve got to do it properly otherwise I ll never know I ve not given up my 2 coffees a day yet but I fear it 's only a matter of time Starting Weight 19st 9lb -

Cavum by Wolfgang Kramer and Michael Kiesling In Kramer and Kiesling 's new Cavum the designers offer a new gamer 's game that reflects the unique sensibilities which have given us games from Torres to Maharaja As is typical of this team they present us with a wide ranging menu of choices each turn and enormous freedom to manage our strategies For some this freedom lets players fully manage complex strategies while for others the freedom only means confusion and headaches What is especially interesting is how the designers style is expressed in a new way - disguised but still unmistakably Kramer and Kiesling Wolfgang Kramer and Michael Kiesling have been working together as co-designers since 1995 but they came to the attention of many gamers with the release of Tikal and Torres in 1999 In both of these games players had free form turns in which they could choose from a menu of actions - moving building exploring creating new pawns - each of which required the expenditure of some number of Action Points which were limited every turn Tikal was followed by Java in 2000 and Mexica in 2002 and these games are regarded as a trilogy - for their obvious use of this shared system for the use of masks on their box cover art and also for the graphic design used in the games by artist Franz Vohwinkel Depending on how you felt about these games the AP trilogy either referred to Action Points or Analysis Paralysis because such freedom could lead players to get stuck managing the details of each game turn With some subsequent games such as Maharaja Australia Bison and even Sunken City this system got stretched in different directions but what remained constant was the use of a menu of potential choices confronting players that allows them to manage their turns with great flexibility Cavum is a relatively complex tile laying track building game in which the designers place their stamp in a new way At the beginning of the phase players fill their player mats with the 12 assets shown above Each represents an action he ll be able to take once Four of them are ordinary tiles to lay although each one has a different amount of track ( or in this case tunnel ) One has a piece of track with a big ol piece of dynamite on it The three cubes are stations - and these are the only pieces that a player truly owns They will serve as starting and ending points for paths the player will trace in an effort to claim gems and they will also block other players paths The gray tile with stones on it represents a vein which the player may place and discover - and will be a source from which all players claim gems Then there are two wild tiles which may substitute for any of the above and finally the symbol for prospecting This will always be the player 's last action in the turn when he traces a path between any two of his stations crossing through any quantity of tunnels in an attempt to pass through previously placed veins and pick up as many gems as possible Here is where I think the designers really show their true colors During a phase a player is going to engage in all twelve of his actions However the phase is broken up into any number of turns During a player turn he must select between one and four of his actions to perform before passing his turn So these twelve actions might be distributed among as many as twelve and as few as three player turns per phase Each phase always culminates in the prospecting action So one player might choose to rush with his actions to ensure that gems are still on the board when it 's time to prospect Another might proceed very slowly forcing all players to take their actions so that he may use all the resources out there when he finally prospects With such flexibility it is easy to see why this is very much a gamer 's game - and one which can succumb to Analysis Paralysis in the wrong hands I wonder to what degree Kramer and Kiesling were inspired by Martin Wallace 's Age of Steam as they seem to have created a sort of negative image of the Wallace classic In Age of Steam players are tracing paths with cities as the end points running through as many towns as possible In this case players own the tracks and the cities are public In Cavum things are reversed The paths are public but the end points - the stations - are what is owned by the players In Age of Steam goods begin on cities and get removed as they are used In Cavum the goods that are removed appear on the veins - which are the equivalent of Age of Steam 's towns Age of Steam paths colored for clarity There is an important consequence of having players share all the track in Cavum They need to be interconnected with lots of junctions so that one player can trace from his stations through various veins and back to another of his stations while another player can use much of the same track use many of the same veins but return to his own station In Age of Steam where players own each piece of track exclusively the paths don t interconnect as much and tend to be simpler Can you connect a path between any two blue stations ( cubes ) that pass through as many gems as possible without passing through any red or yellow stations Can you do it before other players get impatient This tangled web is what can make Cavum more than a little brain-burning What about that dynamite Each turn a player must place at least one tile with dynamite on it It is possible to cover up those pieces with normal tunnels in order to delay their destruction but at the end of the turn all exposed dynamite tiles get removed - and also take out all top tiles in the six adjacent spaces In a four player game it 's possible for 28 tiles to go to heaven Some have characterized this aspect of the game as very nasty Incredible as it sounds I don t think this rule is there especially to a a take that element to the game and in my playing it didn t come off as mean Rather the board can get so dense and locked in I think that the designers put in the dynamite in order to insure that the board continues to change after each phase The game is not that nasty because once a player has created a path it is difficult to obstruct that path until after he has collected his gems The dynamite doesn t blow until the very end of the phase A itionally although stations block other players paths they can t be played on existing track Even if someone places a track tile in your way you may be able to promote it by placing another tile on it - as long as the new tile has more connections The only way I know of to to mess with an existing path is to promote it with a new tile that changes its connections Note that unlike Age of Steam all existing connections do not need to be preserved The way that the designers stray from their Action Point menu and instead specify the particular actions a player must allocate during each phase is a very clever way of directing game play If this game were from the AP trilogy it is possible that each action would have had its own cost A simple tile might cost 2 AP one with all connections might cost 6 AP tiles with dynamite could have their own cost as would stations The game would have been even more free form perhaps more strategic and certainly more ma ening Instead each player gets a series of 2 /3/4/6 branch tiles and they all must be used Any tile may promote any other tile with fewer branches There becomes a natural flow and strategy to the phase Try to start out with the simplest tile possible and as opponents mess with you hold back the more complex tiles to play on top and rescue yourself Or else use your six early on secure a complex path - but leave yourself vulnerable if another tile you were relying on gets rerouted I think that with this method Kramer and Kiesling have struck a nice balance between freedom and structure in their use of an action menu Where things seemed to spin out of control was in the paths themselves which need to be twisty and often difficult to visualize Indeed all players tend to be creating paths which all cross over the same terrain and it seemed difficult to create a master plan that brilliantly snatched lots of gems Rather you re more likely to feel like an idiot if you don t get lots of gems I suspect that experienced players will learn to visualize the board better make more strategic use of stations and reduce the apparent chaos But in my playing understanding the board was a little like tracking a single strand of spaghetti as it winds its way around the meatballs If the game were just about laying tunnels and grabbing gems it wouldn t be a Kramer / Kiesling game On top of all this there is a modest economic system to value the gems that you do get At the beginning of each phase you can take order tiles It 's exactly what you think Taking the one pictured is a commitment to acquire and trade a light blue a dark blue a green and a red for 26 points Fail to do so and you lose 2 points The risks aren t great but neither are the rewards because you can still sell gems back to the market - potentially doing even better In the example here eight of the yellow gems are either still on the board or in people 's hands A reverse auction is held starting at 8 and going down and the lowest bi ing player could sell as many yellow gems as he owns at his bid price So there are two ways to collect points for your gems and which is better will depend on how many players own a given color and how aggressive the bi ing gets The ability to sell gems either to the market or by completing orders struck some of us in our session as a little o It watered down the tension If players must complete orders then a player has pressure to get the right combination knowing that not getting the last gem is a big loss of potential points Such high stakes would provide a natural bomb in the game as it does in Alan Moon 's Ticket to Ride Alternately forcing players into the market would have created a more economically oriented games in which players must monitor which gems are valuable jockey for those and close opponents out of them By providing both alternatives players are most likely to go for orders - but relax knowing that the market provides something of a safety net if plans go awry Perhaps the all or nothing game created too much chaos but this is so obviously a gamer 's game it is surprising to see it made a little more family friendly I d love to speak with the designers to learn what they were thinking I enjoy path laying games and I especially enjoy the complexity that Kramer and Kiesling bring to their best gamer 's games Given the history of such games I am not convinced that paths laid by Cavum make the most satisfying use of the choices the genre has to offer The use of actions in the menu in which players may order and group their 12 actions in any way they like - seems to have enormous potential and I hope to see it in a future game The actual tile and path creation seemed overly involved and counterintuitive I look forward to future playings to see if I 'm able to wrap my brain around this game or whether the game proves to be the stronger and wraps itself around me DOMINION by Donald X Vaccarino If Sylla was a blend of old wines in a new bottle Dominion is a tasty young wine which seems unlikely to mature greatly Dominion has become an overnight hit and so many readers have already played it to death since its recent release I ve played it only once but what stands out about it is its originality despite its simplicity The goal is to collect the most and best victory point cards into your deck Each player has his own deck of ten cards - seven with (1) gold and three with (1) VP He draws five cards from his deck and can use the gold cards to buy either more gold more VP 's or any one of ten special power cards (\ kingdom cards ) which are arranged in a display Cards so purchased are placed into his deck for future draws After the player has used a power from one of his special cards and purchased a card using his gold then both used and unused cards from his hand are placed in his discard pile - to be recycled when his draw deck has been used up In this way players are consistently drawing five cards taking actions buying new cards and then drawing more Cards used - or not - are continually being recycled but at a slower pace as his deck grows in size When sufficient cards have been purchased the game ends and the player with the most points in VP cards wins This feature of continually drawing and renewing one 's own deck and building that deck on the fly is very original and the game plays like no other Eurogame Because a player must as a default draw exactly five cards a turn and work with only those cards at any given time the game requires a player not to maximize his assets with the most extensive display of powers possible Instead the game is about concentration How can a player build a deck such that a random assortment of any five cards at a time be most powerful most consistently What we see is that the cost of a ing gold cards to his hand is disproportionately high with higher values of gold Gold ca rds valued at (1) have no cost those valued at (2) cost three and those valued at (3) cost six This seems counterintuitive until you realize that normally a deck consisting of all (1) value gold cards could never buy anything costing more than five ( and then only rarely ) while a deck of (3) value gold cards can much more easily accumulate brawny values used to purchase big VP cards or strong powers In any given game there are ten different kingdom cards to choose from but the game comes with 25 unique decks so that the smorgasboard of choices may be different with each game Examples of powers in the set I used were ones that gave players extra actions and / or extra opportunities to buy cards There were powers which allowed a player to a three cards into his hand ( remember they all recycle so this is an alternative way of concentrating your hand ) and ones which permitted gold cards to be upgraded to the next higher level Player interaction is very limited and from what I saw came in two forms One is that there are a few cards which enable a player to attack others for example by forcing them to discard down to three cards and other cards which enabled players to defend against such attacks In my game these were used sparingly because they don t really help you advance your agenda and even a defensive card needs to just happen to be in your hand at the time of an attack for it to do any good The other form of player interaction concerns the pace of the game A strategy which relies on gradually building up a killer hand and then collecting VP 's can be counteracted by a strategy which attempts to buy lots of cheap cards and end the game quickly In practice I don t believe that players gain from building up large decks because their powers are not cumulative You re still drawing only five cards at a time The value of a large powerful deck is that it is less diluted by VP cards But an opponent cannot surprise you by ending the game If other players switch into collecting VP cards 'm ode you can shift gears quickly Certainly the dynamic deck building of Dominion is original A ing to the freshness of the game is the way that 25 distinct decks of kingdom cards can be mixed and matched to create unique situations for the players However many players have compared this game with Tom Lehmann 's Race for the Galaxy - with many fans stating their preference for the latter If Dominion is unique - is the comparison reasonable Looking at the ways that each game works sheds some light on what makes each game special - and also how very different mechanisms can be brothers under the skin Like Race for the Galaxy and its predecessor San Juan by Andreas Seyfarth Dominion is an economic game based entirely in cards Each player collects cards which enable him to buy yet other cards which a to a player 's collection giving him new powers and more victory points One glaring difference which drives different approaches in each game is that in Race for the Galaxy players are purchasing cards for a permanent display in front of them while in Dominion purchased cards simply enter a player 's deck The Race for the Galaxy player has assets which are continually growing as each purchased card accumulates powers on top of those already present Every new asset is a good thing In Dominion only a few cards are operating at any one time and then they are quickly recycled and the player moves on to another set It 's good to have lots of kingdom cards because a hand dominated by VP 's can t purchase anything new It is also possible to select a variety of cards which are likely to interact in productive ways when they show up together But the effectiveness of any deck is going to max out quickly as the best you can do is to get a handful of productive interactions and then move on to the next draw Dominion requires a new kind of thinking - one in which more isn t always better In Dominion players begin the game by selecting ten different decks of power cards and those become the fixed choices throughout the game In Race for the Galaxy there is a single deck used in all games but players must make choices from the cards they randomly draw throughout the game The argument for replayability in Dominion is that with ten out of twenty five possible cards being used in a game there are 3 3 million different possible combination In Race for the Galaxy there 's only one Yet Dominion has a hi en weakness It lacks sufficient ability to surprise the players and force them to react to unanticipated challenges and opportunities When a game forces a player to keep on his toes and potentially change his strategy substantially I call it a Nervous System In Dominion the experienced player can survey the available cards map out his strategy and execute it The degree to which cards interact in his hand will force tactical decisions but not generally a rethinking of the plan In comparison Race for the Galaxy has only about 100 cards but they are all ( or nearly all ) different and their appearance at any time is entirely unpredictable A player can set off down a particular path and discover opportunities in his cards which tickle him into straying down a new path Furthermore because the player 's actions depend both on his own choices and those of his opponents he may find himself with unexpected opportunities to exploit Dominion is a sufficiently short game that it isn t crippled by the lack of surprise You can lay out a set of ten cards to start with - and for the next thirty minutes maybe that 's all the surprise you need But it is a limitation that 's in the game 's structure Like a mechanical dog which has dozens of interchangable parts there is lots of potential variety but after a while I suspect that players may find that underneath it all it still always barks to the same cues Time will tell It 's been a long time since I ve contributed to this Journal the last article appeared over six months ago That 's just wrong I have been working on an article - about the Frustration Factor in games However work and writer 's anxiety have been pushing it out and out and It 's a tricky thing to create an article about types of game mechanisms because the subject is so vague Worse any given topic seems to be so br oad that I keep writing when I ought to just wrap it up So in an effort to get the train moving again I 'm offering a sort of article that I ve specifically avoided in the past Game reviews OK - This is not your father 's game review It 's not even Schloesser or Vasel 's game review It 's a game review JBD style 1 ) The focus is on the game mechanics Expect little or no discussion about the theme or components 2 ) Game mechanics are described in their most essential form There will be no rehash of all the rules but instead a focus on the handful of mechanisms that drive the game and the decisions they offer 3 ) I may provide only a passing mention of whether I think the game is good Don t expect a buyer 's guide More emphasis will be placed on what mechanics are innovative or effective and why In most cases I only had a chance to play the game once One reason I ve avoided writing reviews in the past is that there are so many of them out there already Tossing another one onto the net seems redundant However I had the good fortune to attend BoardGameGeek con and had a chance to play many new games which I know there 's lots of curiosity about I 'm going to limit each post to a single review This will hopefully make it easier for people searching for information about a given game to find it and will also keep each post to a manageable length My hope is to publish a new review every three or four days Here goes SYLLA by Dominque Ehrhard Ehrhard used to be a considerable force in Eurogame design but he hasn t been on the gamer 's game radar for a while When they came out I had great enthusiasm for both Condottiere and Serenissima but those are over ten years old Sylla is released by Ystari and it has their fingerpri nts all over it It appeals to gamers and has oodles of features that feel familiar competing auctions income generating tokens food shortages- and it offers situations where scarce resources must be carefully allocated among competing needs The driving mechanism is that players each start with several character cards and will get to a another to their hand in each game turn Each character has one to three colored symbols ( red / blue / yellow ) and potentially an a itional special power After a ing a n ew character at the beginning of each game turn players may use thes e in any of several auctions for tiles which grant benefits Each auction is color coded so a character with a red symbol m ay only be used in a red auction while a character with all three may be used in any of them ( but may only be 's pent once ) the three c olors make him three times more flexible but not three times more valuable Among the other assets that players take each turn and also potentially from winning auctions are disks in any of three colors These disks will have varying values at the end of the game Players also earn money every game turn and also take income from certain tiles and from one of the characters The most original phase comes in the election to suppress bad events Four events are dealt out and two of them will occur each turn Now unspent cards with the appropriate special power ( the soldier in the upper left and the rather matriarchal looking vestal virgin in the upper right ) may contribute to influence these events (T he first event card on the right may receive votes from both soldiers and Virgins the one below it only accepts votes from Virgins The two events receiving the fewest suppressing votes are the ones that occur and these may cause the values of certain chips to drop or may cause a certain type of character card to become out of play for several turns Finally players may convert money into VP 's Sometimes this is through an auction and sometimes at a fixed price From the description you ll see that there is nothing glaringly innovative here There are auctions in multiple currencies The auction to control events is similar to that found in Rieneck and Stadler 's Cuba In Cuba though a single player selects the laws while in Sylla the votes are aggregated among players The varying values of the colored chips is similarly a commonly found market mechanism In spite of this I found Sylla to be greater than the sum of its parts There are A LOT of mechanisms in play each game turn but all are reasonably familiar so the game is easy to learn One aspect of the game I appreciated is the fact that a given character typically can either be spent in the auction for tiles OR provide income OR be applied to a subsequent voting process So many different sorts of needs are competing for the attention of your very limited resources Since the special powers differ from card to card the selection of characters becomes a strategic consideration It is not the same as having a bunch of money and many places tospend it Every card has only select places where it can be used An urgent need to come up with another red dot may force you to spend a card you were hoping to hold back for yet another urgent need Example of six tiles up for auction in a given turn Note that the first two only accept red cards the next two only yellow and the last only blue The winner of each auction chooses the tile to auction next Sylla 's variety of character types and colors its pricing mechanisms for colored discs and its multiple distinct phases create plenty of opportunities to let players try out different strategies Does one concentrate in order to maintain strength or diversify in order to have flexibility If you focus on earning lots of tiles you may earn many discs - but if you ignore the events then other players may drive the value of your discs way down Another strategic decision lies in how many of your characters should be Christian as symbolized by the fish symbol At the end game all Christian cards gain bonus VP 's The down side is that certain events can cause your Christians to remain out of play for one or more game turns An over reliance on such cards can cripple your play indefinitely There are also good situational issues that arise You might expect to win a valuable tile by committing two cards If forced to bid three do you commit a card that you wanted to use in the event phase Every game turn has seven phases with perhaps ten individual auctions but the game doesn t come off as a repetitive auction fest For one the types of things being auctioned tend to vary throughout the turn and so do the m ethods used The auction for tiles is a traditional sequential auction while the bid to control events is more of a majority control type of play A itionally the various currencies are in short supply so auctions don t overstay their welcome Players might have at most four red cards to compete in a red tile auction and all assets are public The auction plays out tactically Do I want to commit everything to guarantee getting what I want - or do I hold back a smidgen to at least drive the price up and maybe get a bargain Each auction is over quickly and there is little downtime I enjoyed my one play of Sylla The play was certainly very familiar but while the game may have lacked focus the variety of arenas to compete in kept the game changing and engaging Players who have appreciated the rock solid reliability and Euro-ishness of other Ystari games such as Amyitis and Caylus are likely to welcome another recognizable member of the family Printer friendly So what is this game about is the natural first question you might ask when someone brings out a new board game for you to try That question can have one of two answers depending on the angle you look at the game from theme or mechanics The game spans 1500 years of Egyptian history You goal is to influence Pharoahs build monuments farm on the Nile and advance the culture of the people in an attempt to appease the god of the Sun Okay but what is the game about It is a set collecting and auction game There is a wide variety of tiles that you ll collect which combine in myriad ways to score points On your turn you ll decide whether to a one more tile to the pool or to auction off the ones already there Your goal is to collect those tiles which will be most valuable to you prevent your opponents from getting too many tiles valuable to them Either of the above is a reasonable description of Reiner Knizia 's Ra Since this is the Journal of Boardgame Design I 'm interested almost 100 % in the latter Either description could reasonably be called the game 's theme but in practice theme has come to mean the historical context in which the game supposedly takes place The designer drapes a bunch of mechanisms around the theme and he has a game Maybe the mechanisms are closely tied to the theme and often in Eurogames they aren t A game at its best is more than a bunch of mechanisms It is a coherent system of mechanisms with a theme of its own Let 's call this theme that summarizes the system of mechanisms the game concept There is nothing to prevent a game built from a bunch of connected mechanisms from being lots of fun but I think that having a strong game concept takes the game up a level It helps to focus the players goals It a 's meaning to the game apart from the theme It defines the game Players choose among a series of actions which help them to score points gain resources or avoid catastrophes The more you are able to take the same action during the game the more valuable it becomes The trick is that in each turn a player is presented with three possible actions and he must decide which one to play and which ones to make available to the players to his left - Notre Dame I enjoy explaining game rules and I always introduce the game by first describing the game concept Every rule has a role in supporting the game concept If players can wrap the whole idea of the game around their heads then all the individual rules ought make sense Players can sit down and get to work at trying to win If they can t get the game concept then most likely you ll see the deer in the headlights look Okay you explained the game to me but what am I supposed to do The issue of game concept surfaced when I recently first played Amyitis by Cyril Demaegd On any given turn a player will take one of five different actions The Merchant and Peasant each give you distinct types of resources The Engineer gives you immediate points and a shot at a majority battle for more points on the main part of the board The Priest lets you take part in a different majority battle in a small part of the board which help you win more points or resources depending on where you choose to play Finally you may move the caravan - in which you spend the resources you earned elsewhere to earn points from cards income faster caravan movement or the ability to earn points on the main board which in turn is limited by choices made by players who chose the Engineer earlier in the game Deep breath So the game Amyitis is about I 'm not sure Cyril Demaegd has a defense of the structure of Amyitis which is worth reading He described it as having a 's tar structure rather than a line structure I think I understand his point Some games ones with a linear structure have their elements lined up like dominoes The first one effects the next one and so on down until the last mechanism which affects the victory conditions Power Grid by Friedmann Friese is an example of this You buy power plants which give you capacity to use fuel You buy fuel that fills your plants and together they can power your cities You extend your network of cities which when powered give you victory points as well as income that feeds the entire cycle for the next game turn What I think is meant by a 's tar structure 'm ight correspond to what Americans call a wagon wheel or hub and spoke 's tructure There is a core mechanism and several secondary mechanisms The secondary mechanisms may be independent but they all affect the core mechanism The problem is that there is no core mechanism in Amyitis The garden which does take up the most physical space on the game board really turns out to be just another way of scoring points that is not obviously more important than any other Here 's my picture of the Amyitis structure which looks more like the floor plan from a spy movie than a wagon wheel From all this it may come as a surprise when I say that I think Amyitis is a hell of a lot of fun There are some very clever mechanisms in the game and notwithstanding the nightmare diagram above the interrelationships play well However playing Amyitis is a little like playing with sand It can be lots of fun but there is nothing to hold on to A strong game concept doesn t make a game good It makes

An Ode to Women in Technology This post is part of Ada Lovelace Day in honor of women excelling in technology Quick Who was the first computer programmer Pause The answer Ada Lovelace She wrote the first program for Charles Babbage 's analytical engine Babbage conceived the idea only to perform calculations but Lovelace saw beyond that purpose to the possibility that that first computer could calculate Bernoulli numbers - My decade-plus in the technology world has showered me with blessings One of these is the women that have guided and inspired me Here are a few that I want to thank profusely for their guidance support and inspiration Michelle opened the door Lisa illuminates just how big the world can be Liz inspires with her burning intelligence and amazing poise Cyd shows how art spiritual and professional life coexist Christina creates new worlds with her ability to reinvent herself Kit helps me see the practical path and how to plot my own Stephanie embodies true wisdom creativity and focus And last but not least thanks to Mom for being completely open Without her example no doubt that it would be far more difficult to recognize the amazing women that surround me At the IA Summit this past week in Memphis it was brought to our attention that the UX community is blessed to have so many women that actively lead our practice I thank my lucky stars every day -The analytical engine was never built but let 's not blame Lovelace for the failure of the men around her Photo credit Thanks to kpwerker for her great Flickr photo In his 2007 TED talk Michael Pollan discusses the arc that has taken him from his garden to his truly illuminatory set of books ( from Botany of Desire to In Defense of Food ) and what he has learned about our relationship with nature and our food Why is this here It reflects where we go wrong in designing our organizations We attempt set up a system where we take people and insert them into a machine that is designed to bend their will to a strategy There are capital inputs information and time The people and technology output goods and / or services receive the revenue pay the bills and take care of the customers This sounds great until in practice you realize that the strategy decided on by the executive leadership loses it 's effectiveness at the front lines except for rare cases (S outhwest Airlines comes to mind here ) Check out this key point from Pollan Another TED talk on ethanol helped me understand industrial agriculture which of course is a Cartesian system It 's based on this idea of that we bend other species to our will and that we are in charge and that we create these factories and we have these technological inputs and we get the food out of it or the fuel or whatever we want tells an amazing story about the Salatin PolyFace permaculture farm This is a different way to think about nature And a way to get away from zero sum notion from the Cartesian idea that nature 's winning or we re winning Michael Pollan The Omnivore 's Next Dilemma TED March 2007 What Salatin does is create a situation where his animals and the grass that they graze on maximize their desires and in turn produce a truly incredible bounty of food with respect to the amount of land and the investment put into it The cows are not slammed into a barn given a bunch of corn ( which is not good for them ) shot up with antibiotics and fattened until they are 'm arket-ready Rather they are moved from small plot to small plot grazing on brand new delicious grass that they is there desired delicacy Chickens then follow them into that same plot a few days later feed on their delicacy ( fat maggots ) and they defecate as they scatter the cow manure across the lot - which acts as fertilizer for the grass Amazingly the grass itself contributes to this cycle It was tall just before the cows enter the plot After they leave it sheds much of it 's root system (d ue to the root-shoot ratio ) Fungi worms and the like digest the dead roots into new soil Just a few weeks later the grass is again luxurious and tall ready for the next cycle Businessfolk would do well to take a close look at these methods We can continue to scale our organizations based on executive strategy a ing more capital and more people to execute the decisions of the central structure The problem with that approach is that the changing relationship of the organization to its capital and the importance of engaging your employees and customers at a more basic level (s imilar to meeting the desires of the cows grass and chickens ) are changing My gut tells me that the answer lies in creating organizations that satisfy all the parts like Salatin 's farm does You might think of the executives as the farmer the cows and chickens as the employees and the grass ( and animal feed ) as the capital inputs The customers are the same ones who want a Polyface chicken so badly that they drive out to the farm to pick it up (T o read more about the farm check out the excerpt from The Omnivore 's Dilemma on Mother Jones ) Why should we care about this Well as a designer I ve run into too many situations where organization were ill-suited to ingesting and assimilating what the customers and employees really need to be fully engaged This is not a knock on any executive manager or employee Rather it 's just the truth of how the information flows and responsibility distributed in most organizations today Through methods like mental models we can get into the thought processes of all involved and figure out where disconnects or misunderstandings lie I am building a practice around these models and how they can align an organization 's resources and people in way most effective for both the company and the customers I hope you ll come back at some point as I explore these and similar issues in ways that show why such a practice is necessary and how it can be carried out Jeremiah Owyang indomitable social media analyst absolutely nails why large organizations will find it very very difficult to allow the level of transparency and real interaction necessary to evolve their businesses ( both strategy and operations ) as the face of market and internal communications continues to evolve He distinguishes three impossible conversations asking for feedback saying positive things about their competitors and admitting they were wrong Asking for feedback is fine but most organizations are not at all set up to actually listen ingest the feedback and decide whether or how to a ress the issue Employees are at the breaking point already Productivity in most organizations means employees are left with precious little time to adjust to new ideas unless they come from management or from within carefully managed feedback channels Some employees may be able to get ahead or ignore some of their work and find ways to try new things These mavericks should be rewarded Social technologies ( wikis blogs social networks ) can help but unless they are used in concert it 's difficult to use them effectively Imagine a symphony without a conductor where the musicians are all playing different music at the same time or in well-run organizations the same music to different rhythms Experience allows me to understand why saying positive things about their competitors is so difficult but I wish there was a way to show the larger organizational consciousness why this fear is more destructive than anything Companies use ideas from their competitors all the time so not giving deserved kudos is paramount to denigrating many of that company 's own ideas Market results display an organization 's effectiveness so stop being afraid to show some appreciation of those with whom you share industry space Jeremiah makes this excellent point Customers aren t stupid In fact they know who your competition is and they talk amongst each other Most companies are not actually part of the conversation but mostly adjacent to it In that position they will miss some critical piece of intelligence Right now the status quo might be holding but the effort required to use the same channels for marketing customer service and institutional knowledge is growing Sooner or later this self-imposed ignorance will come back to haunt them Admitting they were wrong is difficult for everyone at turns yet most individuals let their guards down at some point Yes organizations have to worry about legal culpability but in the end they MUST learn to understand that if they are up front and act quickly when mistakes occur the likelihood that customers will be furious enough to sue is greatly reduced And if they do then the problem hasn t been resolved None of these conversations are easy nor are large organizations the only holdouts Even individuals and small companies screw them up all the time However the pressures to really listen and speak honestly are becoming ever more critical to connect people both inside and outside of the organization Here are two sentences that capture where I am at the moment O rganizations have simply lost a sense of what it actually means to be creative For some reason thinking and speaking are accepted as more important work than thinking and making Chris Conley of Gravity Tank in discussion with Adaptive Path 's Henning Fischer Does this apply only to organizations Looking at the amazing people that surround us I 'm struck by how much effort the design community expends in talking blogging and documenting every little thought and experience we have I 'm just as guilty as anyone else - maybe more so as the things going on around us tend to set me thinking and thinking and thinking In the end we are going to see some great transformations of work and life experience in the next several years Gravity Tank is only one example of smart people having an impact far beyond the website Right now I 'm dedicating myself to the making part for a while and looking forward to sharing what happens to my thinking and speaking as a result That dedication has taken the form of joining CloudRaker an amazing design and development agency in Montreal Creative potential exists everywhere -- in every person and as such in every organization -- but the current environment inhibits our ability to tease it into action I will come out of this new experience not only re-grounded in making that happen but also hope to do so in French Here goes nothing Happy holidays to everyone - Yes I know not talking here mostly in person Maybe I should at least be typing Stay tuned Recently on the excellent bplusd blog Jess interviews Brandon Schauer of Adaptive Path about designers desire to contribute to the strategic discussion with business folks I really like this statement as it reflects a trend that I 'm seeing ( and may be guilty of myself ): I think it gets reinforced by some people in the design community who make the leap from the fact that I identify as a designer and therefore I am a design thinker and I can make these great strategic contributions if they d only let me There 's this note of almost entitlement that has crept into the design community That 's something I 'm particularly cautious about because I think that most designers aren t design thinkers yet because they don t have the concrete fluency with business and many visual designers don t face the same constraints on actual usage that an interaction designer or industrial designer face As designers we get used to exploring possibilities and finding creative solutions but we don t necessarily ever pay the price or see the real impact of what we create I 'm troubled by that note of entitlement particularly from people who have a ed business vocabulary to their repertoire expecting that to be enough It 's not enough We must also take the time to truly understand what it means to make business decisions and deal every single day with the repercussi ons - There is a reason that most business conversations include a healthy dose of reality checking namely that in business you make a decision see how it worked and make another Designers can help widen the considered field of these decisions but we must also be willing to see the constraints and know where to push the envelope In some ways the relationship between design and business is the same as that between design and technology Design creates something technology builds it These relationships work far better when there is some involvement of the builders during design ( and vice versa ) along with feedback once the building is complete and the result out in the ether This conversation is why you often hear about accountability in post- mortems on software projects ( In fact I should probably label that arrow as such Let 's imagine it for a moment ) So back to business and design How do they relate to the design / build discussion Well instead of just being told what to design Designers want input into the possible solutions to a problem We need to learn to talk to each other better to make this work At the IIT Strategy Conference ( link from bplusd ) Roger Martin dean of the Rotman School of Management in Toronto gave a great talk about the approaches based on validity (d esign ) versus reliability ( business ) He covers both what both designers and businesspeople can do to smooth communication and therefore benefit from a better working relationship Schauer illustrates just how that might work with this anecdote from a recent project We helped identify key metrics that people actually cared about that the web and the interactive marketing group could actually impact and how can we calculate the impact that a potential project could have on those numbers Su enly they are having this financial dialog when before they were just talking about personas or user flows and things like that So that really changed their relationship with the rest of the organization by being able to think through and articulate things in a way that was valued Don t you want to have that same relationship with your colleagues regardless of your perspective We would all benefit from it Check out the full interview which includes many ways designers can get smarter about business Hello all Though quiet the blog front be for me the words flow ever more Trust that when I ve something to say it will appear in this exact space If you catch me in person I ll talk your ear off to be sure Portland was lovely thank you very much WebVisions plays mellower than the IA Summit which I appreciated with my need to keep my mind on my presentation and enjoy my Portland friends Jeremiah Owyang of Web-strategist com and Podtech caught me in the hallway at the Portland Convention Center to ask me a few questions about how corporate managers can understand and leverage IAs in their work Dissecting Big and Little IA on the fly was not an easy feat but I enjoyed the conversation and the challenge Thanks Jeremiah Also Jaman continues to sprout happily Over the last couple releases we ve made huge upgrades to the software website and the movie catalog For those foreign film fans out there look for many familiar classic and provocative movies coming online shortly For more about Jaman and what we re attempting see me blab further about Jaman on Lunchmeet Also Boxes amp Arrows hums along quite well I generally act behind the curtain there but plan on occasion to emerge with an article or two over the next few months So that 's my story for now Feel free to drop me a line and let me know what you re up to Hey all Back in minor self-promotion mode I ll be speaking at WebVisions in Portland May 3-4 on the how technology allows ( or makes ) us step out of our comfort zone to follow our ideas into new places connect with people with whom we can make them happen and find real innovation in spite of the cynicism and inertia of entrenched institutions I got the idea for this talk after seeing many friends going into business for themselves hearing folks speak of such paths at the IA Summit including Joshua Prince-Ramus amazing architecture projects At WebVisions I ll zoom out to explore what this might mean not only for Web professionals but for the petri dishes of change ( buzzword innovation ) in many facets of our lives This is a conference that I ve heard good things about previously but this will be my first time attending The lineup is an incredible mix of designers coders entrepreneurs and strategists ( too many to detail here ) One talk I ll be watching closely is David Pescovitz ( of BoingBoing fame ) thought about how info overload will be conquered That intrigues me to no end If you re going to be in Portland for WV let me know So as I noted a couple of posts ago this year has gotten off to a very interesting start First the articles on Boxes Arrows and the IA Summit precon took things in a new direction now film festival season rejuvenates the batteries Along the way another huge opportunity came a-knockin Liz Danzico the Great has handed over the B amp A Editor-in-Chief reigns to me with Christina making the official announcement during 3-minute Madness at the Summit Thanks Christina for trusting me with your baby Finally a bit more attention will be paid to how this blog communicates what I 'm thinking Those of you who know me well probably laugh at my posting frequency as it 's basically a minute fraction of my brain cycles However even those folks know that I 'm quite considerate in my attempts to keep from creating noise When I have something to say I ll continue to show up Taking a look at the postings I ve been making and in recognition of these new currents I 'm making a small change to the blog title - from User eXperience to eXperience Minutiae to be sure but I feel better about that electronic visage I still love the users but I 'm more interested in these days about the whole enchilada of

PSYCHIATRIST :\ Okay tell me about this recurrent dream that you just had Don t leave anything out DREAMER :\ Well as it always does it started on a beach on a cold and overcast day The place was almost empty and I remember wondering where everyone was Even in the winter there should have been people walking their dogs Where were they now DREAMER :\ Across the water I marveled at what appeared to be glaciers but I also wondered how that could be I mean there weren t supposed to be glaciers there DREAMER :\ Unable to take the cold any longer I walked over to a nearby hotel hoping to get warm in the lobby DREAMER :\ An employee appeared at the door He had a mocking impudent face and I could tell that he was going to turn me away but a voice from inside told him to let me in He reluctantly opened the door DREAMER :\ Inside a man with a fedora beckoned me to get into an elevator with him DREAMER :\ We went to the top floor in silence and when the door opened we were in a ballroom People were dancing lethargically as if they d been doing it for a long time DREAMER :\ The man in the hat pointed to a window DREAMER :\ I looked outside but didn t see anything special It was daytime and kids were playing in the street DREAMER :\ I turned to ask the man what I was supposed to be seeing but he was gone It looked like he d escaped onto the roof DREAMER :\ I turned to the window again and this time everything had changed It was dark outside Somehow night had fallen and the impossibly thick and expanding glacier I d seen out at sea was now right outside the window slowly and inexorably pushing cars and debris ahead of it At the speed it was going it would only be a matter of hours before the town and everybody in it would be crushed DREAMER :\ In a panic I shouted to a man who was on the phone nearby Nothing I said seemed to matter to him DREAMER :\ I called to an old woman too and got big belly laughs in return She thought it was hilarious PATRONS :\ Hey quiet down over there If you want to shout go outside BAND LEADER :\ Yes why don t you go Nobody wants you here DREAMER :\ I knew it wouldn t do any good to argue and I had a strong feeling that if I d stayed something horrible would happen so I made for the stairs DREAMER :\ On the way down it occurred to me that I might not be the only person who didn t know about the glacier I thought I d warn the other people in the hotel so I frantically knocked on doors One opened by itself revealing a fat man screaming on a couch I tried to reason with him but the more I talked the louder he shrieked DREAMER :\ Another door opened into a room of people who appeared to be waiting for something They were indifferent to what I said about the glacier and seemed to resent my presence DREAMER :\ Other people just stared DREAMER :\ The final door opened and revealed revealed what What kind of crazy place was this DREAMER :\ Out on the street it was dark and there was snow on the ground DREAMER :\ No use trying to get my car It was somewhere under the glacier now DREAMER :\ In the distance I thought I heard a humming and churning noise I didn t pay much attention at first DREAMER :\ After a while the sound was deafening Holding my ears I looked this way and that and finally came across a shaft of light zig - zagging its way methodically over the sidewalk When I looked up to find the source I saw it a round mechanical thing in the sky with a searchlight in one eye It scanned the street apparently looking for people I hid behind a pillar til it passed DREAMER :\ It 's a good thing I did because round flying things were soon all over the streets incinerating every human who couldn t hide fast enough DREAMER :\ If that wasn t bad enough groups of predatory human spotters began to emerge from nearby buildings and joined the hunt Whenever they spotted a fleeing man they blew a whistle which summoned the killing machines How could people do that to their own kind DREAMER :\ I saw a group of men on their hands and knees and ran over to them to warn them I did everything to get their attention but to no avail They were absorbed in watching something that was in the ice under their feet DREAMER :\ I looked down and sure enough there really was something down there I know it doesn t make sense but there were there were live women under there and they were beckoning to the men on the surface DREAMER :\ These were no ordinary women Most were stunningly beautiful and they flirted like sirens A few had the sentimental appearance of beloved and long-dead mothers and sisters Every man saw the unique woman that he yearned for Finally one of the men unable to restrain himself any longer reached out and clasped the hand of one of the women DREAMER :\ He was immediately pulled under the ice and drowned DREAMER :\ as I was a moment later I remember looking up at the hole in the ice as my lungs filled with freezing water As it always does in these dreams the hole filled with light as killing machines leaned down and watched me with impersonal interest I guess with all that thrashing around I put on a pretty good show DREAMER :\ And that 's it That 's the point where I always wake up What does it mean Am I going crazy PSYCHIATRIST :\ Crazy No no Not crazy We ll talk about it next week I do have to remind you though that the magazines in the waiting room are for all my patients and if you continue to take them home I ll have to charge you for them THE END BTW Many thanks to the excellent blog Shadowplay which is where I got most of these pictures http // dcairns wordpress com / Okay here 's ( above ) a revised version of the second draft Please please tell me if you find that any of it is still confusing It works for me but maybe I ve lost my objectivity Many many thanks to commenters who let me know what was wrong with the previous versions Click to enlarge Kali sent me this video ( above ) What a pal What a pal Have you seen the George Liquor on a log that she 's selling on her site It 's beautiful Spike Jones is a caricaturist 's dream ( above ) His head is shaped like an upright football with a wide cartoony mi le section and a narrow top and bottom The young Liberace had a fascinating face ( above ) It was wide with heavily pa ed cheeks tiny eyes and a thin pointed nose and chin The teeth were tucked way in under the nose and the hair was combed up and back making it look like it was on fire The older Liberace ( above ) looks a lot more normal Plastic surgery BTW this clip is really funny If you re rushed then start it at the 2 1 /2 minute mark Who is this ( above ) He has a wonderfully comic face ( above ) set off by a round volumetric body and interesting vest wrinkles Vests were God 's gift to caricaturists but nobody wears them anymore This ( above ) is A J Muste a famous pacifist and thorn in the side of the Johnson Administration He had a long narrow head with a huge pointed nose thick horn rims and a high bread loaf fedora This reminds me that most artists don t draw fedoras big enough A good fedora always changes the head shape always looks a bit too straight up and awkward This ( above ) is the Mount Everest of eccentric fedoras true royalty of the hat world I love the way the hat continues the outline of the hair If I ever see these on sale I ll hock my children to get the money to buy one Stepin Fetchit 's half closed eyes ( above ) and high eyebrows were his trademarks but the thing that really made them work was the U 's haped bulge above his nose Charles Laughton ( above ) had even more facial pa ing than Liberace but in Laughton 's case the pads are relaxed and friendly and even a little floppy His face consists of small circles ( above ) embe ed inside larger circles spheres overlapping spheres Last but not least is Louis B Mayer ( above ) His head and body look bland and ordinary but his eyes are 1 000 % alert and ready to go on the offensive It 's the contradiction of blandness and unexpected vitality that makes this picture hard to put down BTW I 'm in a podcast on the ASIFA Hollywood Animation Archive site This is the second installment and this came out a lot better than the first I talk about drawing theories story direction how to do difficult assignments and all that If you re curious to hear what I have to say then give a listen http // www animationarchive org / podcast / Right now I 'm between jobs and unfortunately have plenty of time to fuss over things like cooking In the past two months or so I ve done a lot of experimenting with lunches I was looking for something that would allow me to lose weight but which would be tasty and sustainable something which would form the centerpiece of my lunches for years to come regardless of deviations I was anxious to make my peace with vegetables too so they had to be in there After trying a bunch of foods I came up with what I think is a clear cut winner which I ll reveal at the end of the post I think it ll surprise you but first I want to tell you about some of the meals I tried Well the first thing I tried was the complicated vinaigrette salad that I call The Parallel Universe Sala dafter the physicist friend who turned me on to it I put up the recipe in a post about two years ago I ate it four times a week for several weeks and it was so delicious and so filling that I sometimes skipped dinner afterward without missing it A success you say Mmmm not exactly The problem was that I ate so much of it that I began to get tired of it You can get too much of a good thing Not only that but it sometimes left me with a craving for ice-cream a few hours later making me wonder if the salad was really satisfying my need for fat It was delicious but I felt I had to move on After that I tried frozen Marie Calendar pot pies I microwaved them for 15 minutes as per the instructions on the box then when they came out and were still intensely hot inside I stuffed them with half-cooked veggies By veggies I mean mushrooms cooked in a little olive oil and bacon fat and slightly cooked diced celery walnuts onion and any vegetable I had in the refrigerator that could take the heat It was great the problem was that these pies and veggies tasted so good that I ate nothing else for a week and then grew tired of them at least for a while Next I tried soups Soups make good lunches and are good repositories for veggies I d heat up Campbell 's Chicken Broth throw in some of those tangled bean noodles that look like birds nests throw in spinach and Japanese pre-cooked fish or shrimp and at the very end toss in some hard-boiled egg slices Delicious Campbell 's makes a good mushroom soup too and into that I poured my usual mushrooms veggies fettuccini and some cut-up boiled ham slices I found it handy to always have mushrooms celery walnuts ham slices and fettucini around They re good for a ing bulk to almost anything you cook I always have alfredo handy too Alfredo is fattening so I only use it in small quantities usually to ease the pain of eating vegetables that I don t like Oh and I took a liking to fennel ( above ) If you don t know what that is it 's the ugly white and green bagpipe of a vegetable that you always pass by in the supermarket because it looks so alien It 's a real Frankenstein monster of grafted elements mild white onion-type mass on the bottom celery-type stalks in the mi le and delicate little dill-type leaves at the top I know that doesn t sound appetizing but trust me it tastes better than it looks How does it taste Well it 's like a sweet slightly licorice-flavored extremely mild onion It 's not really an onion but it looks and feels that way It 's very cheery and eager-to-please and makes good filler in a recipe that requires bulk I cooked it with mushrooms and shallots and a ed it to other things It was great but once again I ate so much of it that I couldn t bear to look at it for a while This brings me to the grand finale where I reveal the most successful lunch recipe I tried during that time Which recipe got the top spot I hate to say it but none of them They were all too doggone tasty and fattening I ended up gaining weight instead of losing it The only lunch I ate during those few weeks that was consistently delicious dietetic healthy and sustainable was drum beat please good old American peanut butter and jam on bread or muffin served with milk Yep that and nothing else A popular hippie book called Diet for a Small Planet also recommends it It 's nutritious and you never get tired of it Something in the chemistry of it makes it ever-green for your taste buds It doesn t go with vegetables though I guess I ll have to save those for dinner So that 's it for now but I ll put on my mad scientist cap and keep experimenting I thought I d put up a few examples of surreal cinematic nightmare sequences The first ( above ) is from a film called Bewitche dwhich according to Thomas in a comment was directed by Arch Oboler (T homas also recommends Oboler 's other film The Twonky ) The clip looks like something Borzage would have made Borzage is a favorite director of David Cairn who runs one of the most interesting cinema sites on the net a blog called Shadowplay That 's where I got this video The end sequence of Stranger on the Third Floor 'm akes such an indelible impression that it 's easy to forget the surreal second-best sequence ( above ) that 's in the mi le of the film For those who ve forgotten here it is This ( above ) is a trailer for the re-release of Hitchcock 's Vertigo Not all the shots are from the film 's nightmare but this cut still succeeds in being nightmarish More of Vertigo this time the main titles Bernard Herrmann 's film scores are some of the best classical music written in the 20th Century but he 's seldom on concert programs Is that the fault of the concert halls or of lawyers who make it hard to get the rights I tried to buy sheet music for piano transcriptions of his work and couldn t find any even on the net Thanks to Jerk for this clip from Spellbound Thanks to Kurdt for Disney 's Pink Elephants And thanks to Anonymous for the Wild Strawberries video ( above ) Have I missed any good nightmares Any suggestions I 'm reading a book about Thomas Cook calle dThe Romantic Journey Cook ( above ) was the world 's first travel agent and if you think that 's a dull subject for a book then you couldn t be more wrong Cook was a genius The man was born in 1808 while Napoleon was still in power He spent the first half of his life arranging tours to English seashore resorts for the religious and temperance societies that he belonged to I don t think it ever occurred to him or anyone else that you could make much money doing that He just wanted to be useful to the organizations he belonged to Besides if there was money to be made it would logically go to the railroads and hotels not to the poor fool who got stuck with buying everybody 's tickets Like I said even Cook didn t think there was money in it Travel in Cook 's time was a dirty affair for people who weren t rich The railroads advertised cheap rates to the seaside towns which resulted in shockingly crowded beaches and hotels It wasn t uncommon for twelve people twelve to share a bed with other friends sleeping on the floor Stressed out hotel patrons would sometimes show their resentment by pooping in the bureau drawers The streets were crowded with rowdies and the beaches were so densely packed that bathers could hardly see the sand ( above ) Women who could afford it rented clunky changing room wagons which attendants pulled out into the surf for them Occasionally big waves ( above ) would knock over the wagons and the women inside would have to be rescued sometimes by naked men It seems that a sizable number of men believed that bathing suits were unhealthy for the wearers Cook 's insight was that was that many people would be be happier in less crowded resorts in places like Scotland Some of those resorts weren t served by the railroad so Cook arranged for carriages or boats to supplement the rail service Some English customers regarded the Scots as barbarous and didn t relish the idea of negotiating with them for meals and hotel rooms so Scott sent agents ahead to take care of all that and he was even able to get group discounts Little by little he assembled the modern concept of the package tour What 's fascinating about all this was that each of Cook 's improvements was copied by the railroads and steamship lines who opened their own copy cat travel agencies and who had the advantage of established reputations and lots of money for advertising Amazingly Cook managed to stay ahead of the game How did he do it Maybe it 's because his competitors were just hirelings of the railroad and had to get every change okayed by higher-ups Cook was free to innovate When a woman on one of his tours complained about unsanitary foreign toilets seats he quickly invented a personal folding metal toilet seat cover Now that 's enterprise Cook also benefited from his philosophy Other travel agencies were diverted by lucrative commissions from the wealthy Cook on the other hand found it impossible to disavow his innate sympathy with the working man and instead chose to treat his ordinary patrons as if they were wealthy He arranged tours for the rich but he was careful to keep his standard prices low and expected customers to dress well and avoid offensive behavior Rowdies got a refund and were booted out The much admired civility of the British mi le class owes a lot to the nudges it received from business men like Cook BTW the final two posters weren t originated by Cook 's agency I put them up because they exemplify the spirit of what the man was trying to achieve Here they are works of three of my favorite contemporary painters I have more favorites but these will do for a start The first few are by Tim Biskup You can tell he was influenced by Jim Flora but his style is still very distinctive Boy the picture above is so small that it 's impossible to see anything Better click to enlarge What I like about these apart from their color and design sophistication is what Ayn Rand might have called their 's ense of life They re happy They celebrate life There 's no hint of suffering They re about the light-hearted side of life Here 's ( above ) a skull which is usually meant to symbolize mortality or horror or science I may be reading something into this that 's not there but what I sense here is an artist who 's regarding his own fragile mortality and laughing about it There 's time enough to think about the serious side of death Here we re made to see the absurdity of it The delicate colorful paper strips are like our thoughts unraveling Our skull unravels as well We all see such wonders during our lifetimes and they re recorded on flimsy strips of paper that eventually unravel and go away It all reminds me of Macbeth 's Tomorrow and Tomorrow 's peech Very happy ( above ) Sexual but very light and delicate This ( above ) is scary but light-hearted at the same time as if Biskup were reminding us that our humanity is still intact in spite of the mechanistic nature of the modern world Even so he says we d better be careful Elegant imaginative clutter ( above ) This would make a great book cover for an author like Bradbury or Dahl or Borges Here 's something by an under-rated artist Philip Burke Michael Sporn just did a survey of Burke 's work on his blog See the sidebar for the link Poor Woody His face has aged way in advance of his actual chronological age Has his mind aged at the same rate I don t know My guess is that a younger man lies underneath the aged exterior but maybe looking that way depressed him so much that he actually took on the behaviors of an older man Burke 's portrait of Cobain says so much about the price Cobain paid to get where he was Burke 's sketch ( above ) of Dianne Sawyer Look at how saturated the red and purple are Last but not least Gary Panter 's Elvis Zombie This was a book cover I ll bet Panter wishes he d painted a version that was seven feet tall I came across this photo of Elvis while I was searching for Panter 's painting It occured to me that this may be the most famous photo of the rock and roll era what the classic photo of the G I s raising the flag at Iwo Jima was for the previous generation Don t you love close-ups on big movie screens Having live silhouette heads between you and the screen makes the experience even better If you ve never seen a Clampett cartoon on a big theater screen then you ve really missed something His characters are always leaning into the audience and looking down They plead with the audience patronize them almost pat them on their heads You don t get that when you see the cartoons on TV I love the idea of giant heads and bodies looming out over the audience and looking down You don t even need 3D to get the effect If you re Eisenstein or Richard Lester or Sergio Leonne then you love the technique where you show the audience an ultra-long shot then then on the same shot you have someone step in front of the camera for an ultra close-up I love it when monsters stick their heads out over the audience and look around as if they re trying to figure out which person to eat first Amazing but true on a big 2D screen you can give the audience the physical sensation of looking up at something I don t mean a simple upshot I mean a shot where you get a definite sensation of light-headedness and insecurity about your balance as if you d tilted your head way back To see what I mean click to enlarge It 's not enough to tilt the camera up to get this effect You have to have something very distracting to look at up there else the audience 's logic will kick in and they ll talk themselves out of the vertigo you want them to feel O ly enough shooting a glamorous woman in close-up doesn t always work You can convey personality and charm in a close-up but not sexiness not sexiness in the glamour meaning of the word I guess visual sex cues have a lot to do with proportions and you need to step back a little to take that in The close-ups are just punctuation Okay there are exceptions How about Rear Window where Grace Kelly leans into the audience and almost kisses the camera Watching this scene was what your grandfather did to cure erectile dysfunction in the days before Viagra I saw North by Northwest on a big theater screen and the experience was a revelation On a big screen the close-up shots in the cornfield make you feel that Cary Grant wants to jump into your lap He seems to be appealing to the audience for help I never got that from seeing the film on TV 
I ve been extremely busy with DealBase work so have lagged on blogging but have some interesting things coming up and hope to post more soon Recently I a ed RSS feeds to all of the city / destination and hotel pages on DealBase This is just one more way for you to keep up to date with all the deals we a to the system Our other primary way aside from browsing the site of course is to sign up for personalized alert emails This lets you follow one or more cities and set criteria like class of hotel ( i e you only want to see 4 and 5 star hotels ) maximum price and so on You can set a schedule for how often you want the emails ( once a week twice a week daily etc ) We ll send you up to the best 10 deals that match your criteria You can also simply subscribe by just supplying your email a ress and nothing else and we ll set your initial preferences for our top 10 destinations We ll continue to enhance this alert service and I d love to hear any suggestions people have for a itions changes etc Development of the alert emails has been interesting One of the most useful tools throughout has been Litmus email testing service It 's pretty slick They cover quite an array of email clients both web hosted ( Gmail Yahoo Hotmail etc ) as well as desktop ( Outlook Apple Mail Notes etc ) They also do spam testing When you begin a test they supply you an email a ress specific for that particular test run and then you just email them the real email you want tested You can also paste in an email but I prefer to do the sending approach to as closely mimic the real thing as possible I have my IRB and various other bits configured to make it a single command to fire off test cases to a Litmus supplied email a ress and the whole process works great and is truly worth Litmus cost I started off mentioning RSS and back to that The RSS does work differently than the email alerts ( obviously ) and to some degree the web page It is like selecting the Most Recently Posted 's ort on a page (s ee below image ) Deals are supplied to the RSS feed as they re posted just like a blog would do Just one more way to stay on top of deals Oh and don t forget we re on Twitter too Uploaded with plasq 's Skitch [Up date I resolved the Git issue and have now switched to using Hudson The advantages of it 's in-progress display ability to more closely monitor and / or

is not surprising and I 'm surprised it hasn t been a problem sooner since memory is our 1 battle I figured if I was going to up the memory on our CI server I might also try Hudson as that was the main reason for not trying it previously The short story is that I tried it and we re back to Integrity but I learned some interesting things The following is both some notes on installation as well as some reasons why it didn t work out Installing Hudson Our CI box is a slice at Slicehost running Ubuntu 8 04 LTS and I d just upped it from 256MB RAM to 1GB Also of note I ve built and install Git 1 6 4 for this system The following are brief notes on getting Hudson going as it wasn t quite as simple as most folks made it out to be First I followed the directions on the Hudson site for installing Hudson from the Ubuntu package This amounts to a ing the package repository updating apt-get and then doing sudo apt-get install hudson This installs all the Java 1 6 stuff you need ( and mine seems fine with 64bit Java ) and other dependencies After the install Hudson is running on default port 8080 Next up I a ed a server block / configuration in Nginx for Hudson ( and unlinked / removed Integrity ) I then went to Hudson in my browser What I got was an error message about the xstream library Fixing that was easy as it turned out downloaded the latest (1 320 at the time ) hudson war from the Hudson site and replaced / usr / share / hudson / hudson war with it Restarted Hudson and voila now it was up and running Also Hudson runs as the user hudson so I needed to a an SSH key for that user and then a the public key to GitHub And setup a hudson / gitconfig as needed Finally as I found later do a git clone or an SSH to github so that you get past the whole SSH authenticity question when you first SSH to an unknown server Note the Hudson user is not an interactive user i e you can t directly login as that user so to gen the SSH key you ll need do something like su to root and do sudo -u hudson ssh-keygen -t dsa Configuring Hudson Before a ing a project I needed to config some plugins I went to the Manage page clicked on Installed and turned off the Subversion plugin and restarted Next was going back in to manage plugins and installing the Git Github and Rake plugins and again restarting Both restarts showed an Nginx bad gateway error but simply refreshing got it back (p robably just needed more time for Hudson to restart ) Then to configure a build from the main Hudson page after a fresh install click the create new jobs link In the ensuing form enter a project name and select Build a free-style software project Next checked Discard Old Builds which then shows you options (s o you can put in keep for X days or X number of builds ) A ed URL for Github project http // github com / yourproject / yourproject Select Git as the SCM and entered by git github com yourproject / yourproject git URL for the repository Turned on merge after build option This will supposedly a tags for the build to your code base and then merge them back in More on this in a bit Next I configured the build steps for my project All I really did here was take the same build steps I used for Integrity and a ed them as individual shell and rake tasks At this point I fired off a build ( truth be told I started with just a single build step to vet it ) and things worked with the exception of the very last step where I push the Git tags back to GitHub This is what I saw workspace / bin / sh -xe / tmp / hudson1444107192962944065 sh + / usr / bin / git push --tags XML error syntax error error Error no DAV locking support on https // github com / dealbase / dealbase / error failed to push some refs to https // github com / dealbase / dealbase I ve now been searching for answers to this and haven t yielded anything I ve tried the git push directly from a shell with the same result If I do this as a different user ( e g under my user ) it works fine This git push is attempted both as part of a rake task ( the ci_tag task ) as well as I tried making it just a straight shell command in Hudson After a lot of googling and asking and no resolution in sight I ve gone back to Integrity Comparisons and Notes First off I think Hudson looks pretty stellar There are a TON of plugins for it and it seems quite mature and polished The essentially 100 % configuration via the GUI is slick Install despite a few hoops above was actually pretty painless So here 's just a few notes / opinions Hudson You will need some memory to run Hudson more than with Integrity or CruiseControl rb From what I can tell you probably want a system with 1GB or more Various other folks I talked to all had 2GB or more systems and their Hudson processes were taking 1 5GB or more This is partly just a Java thing It should be noted the others were running more than one build with Hudson and mine seemed to work fine on a 1GB total memory system (d idn t seem to hit swap ) Hudson allows you to kill a build while it 's running ( nice ) Hudson works with CCMenu / CCTray out of the box The git integration has more options in terms of picking branches doing merging and various more involved operations but doesn t have GitHub post-receive hook support out of the box ( there are plugins up on GitHub for it but not listed in the standard plugin list ) Hudson runs as user hudson which is a user that has no shell You could change this although the idea is you shouldn t have to However this complicates setting up SSH keys and various things And of course I had the issue with Git as mentioned above I could probably change this to run as my user and so on but part of all this for me is not having to change a lot of defaults and start messing with core configurations / designs of the system In part I just don t have time to do that and to maintain it ( these kinds of changes often cause problems when you upgrade versions etc - also known as you may forget to redo these changes if an upgrade undoes them :) The UI and web app itself is quite nice understandable well done in general for something like this Also thanks to the Tea-Driven blog for motivating me to try Hudson ( and for some tips on Testjour - more on that in another post ) Integrity I really only have one main complaint about Integrity and that has to do with indication of a build in progress It essentially doesn t indicate it - it says it hasn t been built yet but a build may actually be running The CCMenu / integritray plugin will show you that a build is running so this mostly solves my problem but this seems like a core failure I may have to look at fixing this And that is a win for Integrity in that it 's Ruby and thus I ll be more apt to go fix this ( while I spent MANY years doing heavy Java work I don t have interest in working in that code anymore for a task like this ) CruiseControl rb One thing that remains an advantage for CC rb is that it has build artifacts - i e you can create files and such as part of your build and have those known to CC rb where it then links to them in the summary of your build You may or may not need it but it 's also very handy for simply showing you the Git tag you created on a successful build I just touch a file in the build artifacts dir with the name of the Git tag and then I don t have to dig through the output of the build to find my Git tag That 's all the time I have for today hopefully this is also helpful to others Recently I switched the DealBase continuous integration server to use Integrity instead of CruiseControl rb This happened because I d been having some sporadic failures under CC rb that didn t seem explainable ( no code would change and tests would fail at random ) and also due to some changes in Cucumber between versions it all conspired to switch It should be noted that as you might guess the random failures were not exactly random but suffice it to say that the root cause re-inforced my notion to switch My main beef with CC rb has more to do with it being somewhat in bed with Rake and wanting to run your CI build via a rake task and some of the issues ( or impurities ) that come up with that But I 'm boring you Anyway Integrity Setup is relatively easy and is covered fairly well on their setup page / docs But the following is what I did which I 'm documenting for myself and anyone else who may find it useful I setup my server to use with Nginx and Passenger I tried using Integrity with Nginx and Thin but wasn t able to get Integrity to work right (s imilar to the results defunkt had when they tried it at GitHub ) We ve standardized on Nginx + Passenger so this was good anyway I nuked the Nginx I had already and proceeded ( all this being done on an Ubuntu Hardy VPS system at Slicehost ): sudo gem install passenger sudo passenger-install-nginx-module I let it install Nginx and picked the default location I then re-a ed our HTTP Basic Authentication and a few other Nginx tweaks as I had in the prior Nginx configuration Next up was to install some prerequisites and Integrity itself sudo apt-get sqlite3 libsqlite3-dev sudo gem install integrity do_sqlite3 thin integrity install / home / ci / integrity --passenger cd integrity Next you ll want to tweak config yml to customize the domain where you ll access your CI server I left the rest the same Then setup Integrity 's database integrity migrate_db / home / ci / integrity / config yml I also a ed the integritray plugin so that I could continue to use CCMenu to monitor my builds See the integritray GitHub page for simple install Now point Nginx / Passenger at your install by a ing the appropriate server block for a Passenger Rails app such as server listen 80 server_name your ciserver com root / home / ci / integrity / public passenger_enabled on auth_basic Restricted auth_basic_user_file / opt / nginx / conf / htpasswd Finally fire up Nginx and surf to your CI server domain / URL You should see something like this Uploaded with plasq 's Skitch Click the create your first project link and enter details about your app The Git repository field should get your GitHub or other git server URL ( e g your clone URL ) For a build script the following is what I used rake log clear RAILS_ENV = test rake db reset spec --options spec / spec opts spec /--/- _spec rb RAILS_ENV = cucumber rake db reset cucumber --strict -q --format pretty features rake ci_tag This is one nice thing about Integrity - it 's pretty much any command you can give it Sure you might want to wrap that up in a Rake task or a shell script or however you want to do it I just entered that raw so it 's overly obvious exactly what it 's doing I also found this to work better than doing it as a Rake task as somehow I wasn t getting the environment to switch properly under Rake The ci_tag rake task is my task for tagging / labeling succesful builds in Git etc Next you ll want to setup a post-commit service hook on GitHub You can get your Push URL by clicking the edit link for your project in Integiry Uploaded with plasq 's Skitch Note that works even with HTTP Basic Auth just a your user credentials to the Push URL before pasting it in on GitHub Finally fire off a build And note one downside of Integrity is that it doesn t indicate ( in the web UI ) that a build is underway It just says it hasn t been built yet The integritray item and thus CCMenu will show you that it 's building though Lastly some have asked why not XYZ CI server A few notes on this Hudson this looks awesome but also somewhat overkill for our needs I have one project to build and I 'm doing it on a very inexpensive slice that has only 256MB of RAM - I doubt I could even start Hudson in that little RAM being it 's a Java web app etc Secondarily I d prefer to have the app be Ruby so I can hack on it ( I ve made at least very minor tweaks to every CI server I ve used to date ) cruisecontrol rb - this is what we were using and it worked well with minor exception to some random failures and the Rake-oriented build process I d really say this is minor though and would suggest folks try it out You can of course refer to my previous writeup on setting up CruiseControl rb :) CI Joe / cijoe - this is actually what I started with when I looked at exploring alternatives I had problems getting the build working properly which seems o In hindsight that may have wound up being due to some problems during our switch to a newer version of Cucumber But one thing I didn t like is that there is no state maintained so if you stop and start cijoe it loses track of all its previous builds This may or may not matter much to you but I didn t like that I also didn t want to spend time writing notifiers / CCMenu integration type stuff for our needs I will ay that cijoe setup / install is pretty cool Run Code Run doesn t have a viable plan for us yet plus I ve heard having it run custom rake tasks and such doesn t work ( wrong ) Furthermore I didn t really want our private code on their servers and didn t see a need to outsource this others either hadn t heard of them they didn t work well with Rails or whatever - upshot Integrity worked got it up and running fairly fast and didn t need to spend any more time on this A little bit ago I went back to using multiple computers again For a while I d just done everything with a MacBook Pro which was nice - only a single machine to maintain always had everything in one spot But alas twas time for more performance so I got a Mac Pro which is now my primary work machine with the laptop relegated to basically iCal and Things for the bulk of the day ( as my 3rd monitor ) and then any portable needs or working on the couch or deck etc Anyway my main thing against multiple machines after having spent many years with anywhere between 2 and 5 machines ( mostly while working for Adobe ) was the maintenance and synchronization of those machines So now that I 'm back to 2 I am back to wanting / needing my data on whatever computer I 'm using These days this also really extends to my iPhone to some degree as well It 's my truly portable computer So with all the cloud computing / services these days this is to some degree easier I 'm not that big a fan of Google having all my data but I will use the services that are the best in class or best for my needs and no doubt some of that is Google but there are many others I have not gotten all my data truly available on all the computers I want it on or as well as I d like yet but I 'm getting closer Also I agree with Al3x in that if the data is important only having it on a free cloud service is not wise I haven t fully followed that but that is part of my plan Here 's some notes on what I ve done so far Email This one is easy I use Gmail for all my email accounts ( about 15 if you count across various domains and so on ) Right off this is one case where this is the only place my data / email lives so I 'm only solving the accessible from anywhere issue But I 'm also of the mind that I could pretty much lose all my email and be fine If there are truly important things in it that data tends to wind up getting put in somewhere else ( EverNote etc see below ) as appropriate Gmail is so much better than any other Email I even use it for some non-traditional things like all our recipes are stored in a Gmail account Makes it easy to trade recipes amongst friends and family great for searching and again I can get to it from anywhere I can access the web Further I use MailPlane as my actual mail client It is a very rare day that I use a web browser to view Gmail On the iPhone I just use the regular iPhone mail client which has some drawbacks but for my needs is ok Notes and Misc Data This is the place that recently changed and has become an outstanding solution I used to use 37signals Backpack but now use EverNote EverNote is really quite amazing I hadn t noticed the Notebooks before and that 's been a great feature for me to do high level organization Then the searching is quite good ( and of course Backpack essentially didn t even have searching ) But what really swung this over was their desktop client web storage and then iPhone client This gives me great desktop performance but then access from any web browser as well as iPhone AND I get the data stored locally and off-site ( i e on the web ) Furthermore it sync 's across computers So I feel like the data I have here is very safe (s ince it 's in at least 3 places ) Even better this allowed me to stop paying for Backpack ( my use of EverNote is nowhere close to their paid account ) I don t mind paying for software at all but I had felt that I wasn t getting the solution I wanted from Backpack so didn t want to pay for that any longer Code GitHub and Git Do I need to say more Bookmarks Two things here Mac and Delicious I use Safari as my primary browser and leverage it 's Bookmark Bar for common stuff so sync that across machines and iPhone with Mac Delicious gets all the other bookmarks RSS / News Feeds Another recent change was to stop using NetNewsWire which I ve used forever and switch to Google Reader Specifically what made this work well was creating a Fluid app with the Helvetireader styling NNW had sync via NewsGator but it really just didn t work well It didn t seem to keep the list of feeds in sync and then it 's sync during feed download just didn t seem to cut it So now with the fluid app and then just plain Reader ( via browser ) on the iPhone seems to solve this all nicely Documents So far this is a mix of using DropBox and Google Docs DropBox is awesome for keeping files in sync across machines and then also available on the web I ve been ramping up my use of DropBox Things that Aren t sufficiently solved yet Calendar and A ress Book Update I 'm now using Mac to sync A ress Book seems to work great I 'm using iCal and A ress Book Primarily this is due to the super easy sync with the iPhone I can sync two computers with BusySync or some other things but haven t seen a great solution yet as well as haven t investigated that much Even with mac I think you still have to have a primary calendar and you re publishing to the other etc I ve used Google Calendar in the past but didn t like it that much and part of all this is ensuring sync is brain dead easy and solid My wife and I sync calendars with BusySync but that has been spotty The various Google / iCal sync things I ve tried have been iffy in the past And the real key is how well will it sync Google cal to the iPhone calendar An area I need to learn more about A ress Book not sure of my options here either Sync 's nicely with iPhone and Mac so far Music and Photos I ve yet to see an iTunes sync thing that works really well We tried TuneRanger but it was not good when dealing with two existing libraries Also we have a lot of music so keeping it backed up on S3 or similar actually starts to cost real money Of course these days the primary need for this is to sync to my iPhone Most of the time at home I 'm listening to Pandora or some similar thing I use Pandora a lot on the iPhone but I also listen to various podcasts and then there are times when Pandora isn t feasible ( crappy / no signal or I 'm needing to use another app on the phone while listening to music ) These same issues hold true for photos / Lightroom libraries With Lightroom so far for each calendar year I have a Lightroom catalog and then at the end of those years I burn DVD 's with the photos Of course the DVD 's are just sitting in our house right now not in a safe deposit box etc ( we used to do that but haven t since we moved to Oregon - lazy ) But my bigger concern here is that I d like my Lightroom library to stay in sync across my two machines so I can use the burly Mac Pro when working at home but then have my MBP when on the road I guess that 's it for now What solutions do you like What are people doing for large data ( GB 's or TB 's of music photos video etc ) At DealBase we ve been testing Nginx with Passenger and have mostly had good results There are two issues that have come up hopefully only one of which may broadly affect others The first issue which likely affects anyone using this is that it appears that if you combine and cache CSS or JavaScript via tags like this in Rails lt %= stylesheet_link_tag :s tandard cache = 's tandard % gt lt %= javascript_include_tag jquery cache = jquery_all % gt The :s tandard and jquery 's ymbols are expansion symbols for multiple CSS / JavaScript files defined in a Rails initializer On the first request Rails gets it 's supposed to combine all the files as per the expansion symbol definition and then produce a cache file so you have a single file that is included in your HTML This worked fine for us under Mongrel but it didn t seem to regenerate under Passenger after doing a deploy even with a restart to Passenger We had to do a second restart of Passenger and then hit the server at least twice if not more to see it get picked up Thanks to a tip from Engine Yard one solution can be found on the overstimulate blog where they detail how you can a a rake task that you call during deploy to regenerate those cache files This is really even a nicer solution under Mongrel and others as it will mean it doesn t occur during your first request The second problem seems confined to my MacBook Pro laptop ( no problem on my MacPro tower ) That is I simply cannot get Nginx + Passenger to work It installs fine Nginx runs but I get some o permissions problem from Passenger 2009 /05/12 11 57 52 alert 19611 0 could not create / var / folders /7 m /7

occurs when I start Nginx The second happens when I try to surf to a page from my app in my browser ( which makes sense given the first error :) If anyone has any suggestions on this one let me know

solutions to deploying your crontab files when you deploy with Capistrano which I think is great I can t find the first one I saw ( mention in comments and I ll update ) but on GitHub javan has the whenever gem that is really more about allowing you to define crontabs with Ruby / Rails time methods so you don t have to remember the crontab file syntax which none of us ever seems to be able to remember You can of course integrate this with Capistrano ( and that 's covered in his Readme ) The point of all this no more having to remember to go put in or uncomment a crontab entry once you deploy a certain build and keeping your crontabs under version control However for us none of the solutions out there worked quite right and I just use what I find to be a simpler setup First we have multiple servers with different crontabs per server Also we have some environment variables that get defined within the crontab so that they work properly on our Engine Yard slices I just found that while yes I sometimes don t remember all the crontab syntax perfectly I also don t do this often enough for that to be an issue and would rather just have the real deal right there so I knew exactly what I was going to install on my server Lastly I didn t really want to have yet another gem dependency for something pretty straight forward like this ( IMHO ) So get on with it you say what 's the solution Two pieces First I create a crontab directory within my Rails app 's config directory In that I store crontab files named by the hostname of the server - the same thing you d get by doing a hostname on the server You could a an extension or whatever you want but the hostname is what makes this work easily so you want that somewhere in your file naming convention We only have a couple servers and I know them well so I just went with pure hostname for now The contents of each file are exactly what you d see in the crontab file on the server for the user you set it up under Second a simple Capistrano task to affect the given crontab file on the server with an after hook to run it task write_crontab roles = app do puts Installing server-specific crontab run (\ cd deploy_to / current / config / crontab crontab hostname ) end after deploy restart write_crontab That 's it You can obviously tweek this for your own setup for example maybe you need to run it on all roles or different roles or what not Your run command might need to be more robust ( or run a shell script or rake task ) for example if not all servers have crontabs or you have something more dynamic But as you can tell setting this kind of thing up is pretty straight forward and it 's great to keep your crontab setups in version control Thanks to you guys that stimulated the idea in the first place Recently we ran into an interesting performance issue with MySQL We have an automated process we run at night a few nights a week that does data harvesting for hotel rates and such This data is versioned so that we can look at historical values However this script had begun to really crawl Originally it took a couple hours to run But it had gotten to the point where it could take almost a day I tracked this down to being a SQL MAX call used by acts_as_versioned to determine the next version for one of these records The problem is that it had to sift through nearly 10 million records In testing this on my local machine just one of these SQL queries could take 45 seconds Think about doing this across oh say 100 000 hotels ya not good The good folks at GitHub ran into this same thing ( with a table of 36M records ) on nearly the same day Their approach is similar to the approach I ll be taking on another table ( which isn t currently affecting us this way but will have different benefits ) which was to split it into two tables one with older data I could have done this and would have but the reality was that we simply didn t need to keep these versions as we weren t using the data So luckily I was able to just no longer version this particular model and throw out that table After doing that I ran the script and it took just over an hour Yea So this is something to note if you use acts_as_versioned with models that have frequent changes and a decent number of those models to begin with ( think multipliers ) One of the things I ll be looking into in the future is whether that MAX needs to get done or whether acts_as_versioned can be smarter about how it does it On first glance you d think you could just use the version number on the original model itself but that number isn t guaranteed to be the latest number since you can rollback versions and so on 
You may remember the problems that we ve been having with our persistent cache memcacheDB Our initial response was to a a bunch more RAM to the system which would probably only last us a few weeks until we could put a better solution in place Fortunately with EC2 we were able to spin up five new machines with gobs of RAM to fill that temporary role After that we dedicated 33 % of our development team ( i e me ) to swapping it out for a more scalable and long-term backend As of this morning we re now running with our persistent cache backed by Cassandra The migration was seamless (d id you notice ) but the load-impact on our servers is palpable In case you are wondering why we chose Cassandra it is way faster more scalable and has a rich and active development community full of extremely smart and helpful people It 's in use or going to be in use by several large companies ( Twitter Facebook digg Rackspace ) We have the ability to a nodes as load and storage requires and we have the ability to move non-cache type data into it as appropriate We could not have done this in just 10 days without the help of the amazing Cassandra developers and community and EC2 which allowed us to bring up new instances on which to test and ultimately deploy Cassandra I cannot thank the extremely intelligent Cassandra developers and community enough for their work and their help

to fill you in on what caused the problem how we are fixing it and dispel some myths In short we made a technical decision a few years ago that was a good idea at the time but which is becoming increasingly hard to scale We need to make some deep changes to fix it but we put in a band-aid solution of a ing more memory for re it to use in the meantime But before we get too far down the technical rabbit hole while the four of us were busy trying to stop the site from melting any further other things were happening that we didn t get a chance to a ress At the end of the day re it is

we were able to fix this at all is because we are on EC2 and were able to quickly spin up new instances In fact we just had to do it again this morning because we needed even more RAM But I swear it 's been slow since you moved to EC2 -- False We moved to EC2 in May 2009 We only started getting reports of slowness about three weeks ago which we could also see in our logs and monitoring The number of reports got worse as time went on but we didn t see it ourselves so it was hard to track down a specific cause re it is just text so you guys are clearly morons -- False While re it is just text when it leaves our servers there is a whole lot going on under the hood It is a highly customized user experience on par with something like Facebook ( just not as many users ) We do 100 's of transactions every second While we may be doing some things wrong it 's a lot more than just 's elect - from comments where article = foo Let 's start at the beginning Here is a simplified version of re it 's architecture The area where we are having trouble right now is that purple section in the mi le that says 'm emcaches Specifically we are having problems with memcachedb which is where we store a bunch of precomputed listings like all the listing pages profile pages inboxes pretty much any list on re it that is too expensive to calculate on the fly A few years ago we decided to md5 all of our cache keys We did this because at the time memcached ( which is what memcachedb is based on ) could only take keys of a certain length In fact the version it is based on still has this limitation MD5ing the keys was a good solution to this problem so we thought It turns out that this one little decision makes it so that we can t horizontally scale that layer of our architecture without losing all the data already there ( because all of the keys would point to the wrong server if we a ed a new one ) While we could recalculate all the data it would take weeks to do so And that is in fact what we will be doing Memcachedb has served us well but it is getting old It can no longer return data fast enough for our needs due to the way it interacts with BDb ( its underlying data store ) We will soon be picking a new data store to replace memcachedb and recalculating all of the data for it most likely by a ing the new cache into the cache chain and then recalculating what is left after a few weeks But in the mean time what we have done is spin up 5 new instances to run memcached This allowed us to expand the size of the memcache in front of memcachedb to 6GB ( up from 2GB ) Right now this means that about 94 % of each database is in RAM As our site grows this fix will fail us but hopefully it buys us enough time until we can replace the data store As usual if you want to tell us why we suck at our jobs feel free to leave some comments on this post One of the main problems with our request to 'm essage a moderator when you have a problem on a given re it has been that it is completely opaque as to which moderator to message Much lore has been generated on many re its as to who is the good or the responsive 'm oderator and many messages have fallen to the wayside by choosing unwisely By the same token it is unfair to the moderators that they are unable to see over what may very well be community-wide issues To mitigate both of these we ve created a separate moderator inbox for each re it which can be messaged by composing a PM to re itname ( with the hashmark stolen from IRC parlance ) So for now on to reach the admin 's box send a message to re it com and we ll get back to you For other re its we ve a ed a handy link to the moderator box From a moderator 's viewpoint we ve make a UI tweak to differentiate your moderator inbox from your regular inbox And a new orangered alien for when you have moderator mail Clicking on the alien will bring you to your moderation inbox In this view you ll see the messages to all of the re its you moderate organized with the newest on top Clicking on the name of the re it ( in the blue bubble on the top left ) will bring you to a view that shows messages for that re it alone This view is also accessible from the 'm oderator toolbox on each of your re its One thing to note in responding to these messages when you participate on a message thread initiated by a user everything in the conversation will be sent back to the user as an implicit CC tldr Don t message one moderator message all moderators In pursuit of making re it easier to use we ve a ed the ability to get private RSS feeds to parts of the site that would normally require you to log in The new set of feeds is available thru your preference page and is available ( currently ) in both RSS and JSON If you are worried about the security of this we ve a ed a preference to disable it and set it up so that all feeds will be invalidated once you change your password The first example of its use is the front page we want you to be able to customize your subscriptions to different re its but up until now there was no way to get a feed of your personalized front page without passing us your login cookie This is sometimes handled gracefully by browsers but seldom by other feed readers By the same method we re also generating RSS links for your saved liked disliked and hi en pages as well as to get the contents of your inbox ( even your unread tab ) And for the moderators in the audience you ll now find that both the spam and reported listings of your re its have RSS available In this case though you ll find the feed on the page in question rather than on your preference page This should make it much easier to keep dibs on what is making its way onto your re it 's spam pages We ve also fixed a bug on those listings that was breaking hiding of links so moderators will now have the capacity ( at least individually ) to clear out their spam listing So about 8 hours after we put up new markdown rendering engine our call to find exploits was a complete success and here is the new white-hat who found it Besides discovering a bug in the way that discount dealt with escaped quotes in certain places ( with thanks to David Parsons of Discount for getting out a patch so quickly ) we learned that we should probably set up some guidelines for how to report exploits to us So we created a wiki page on help For those of you who don t know the details of how the infamous worm spread on re it 5 months ago here 's the short story a bunch of white-hats created a re it where they tried to create a proof-of-principle worm that would append itself as a reply to all of the comments in a given page The whole thing was contained to a shared comment thread and all of the testing was contained to that thread until one of the users went to their inbox You see the replying JS is common in both areas so an exploit that works on a comment thread works in your inbox Your inbox though has in principle comments from all sorts of other comment threads from all over the site The result was that the worm got out and was allowed to spread freely until we took down ( and later patched ) the markdown renderer The lesson and tldr please don t post or test for exploits in any shared or public areas PM us and then make sure your work is well hi en Once the genie is out it 's hard for us to re-cork it As most of you know re it 's commenting system uses a technology called Markdown that allows you to type stuff like My [s ite ]( http // something com ) is -really- cool and have it rendered as My site is really cool We get so many comments ( and comment-viewings ) per second that doing this translation has always been a major burden on our servers The more CPU cycles we spend on it the more application servers we need and in turn the more connections going to our database servers the more places we have to roll code out to and all sorts of other growth problems But you shouldn t feel one ten-thousandth of a guilt unit over this news because we ve just switched our rendering engine from markdown py ( which is nothing to sneeze at and has served us well since the beginning ) to a 100 %- compatible pure-C implementation of Markdown known as Discount ( Get it ) In our tests Discount is fifteen times faster than markdown py which should allow us to reclaim some of our computing power and devote it to other areas of the site that are struggling If you happen to be the sort of person who can t resist looking for security holes in any new technology and you come across one here please let us know quietly rather than choosing to announce your finding in the form of a worm which takes out the entire site DO NOT SHARE YOUR EXPLOIT WITH ANYONE ELSE I promise that we ll immediately get to work on the problem as soon as you tell us and once it 's fixed we ll give you full credit as well as the special new ultra-rare White Hat trophy We re also retroactively giving it to previous responsible disclosers chromakode and notrael The aptly-named javascriptinjection who wrote and accidentally released the aforementioned worm will get one too but only because he immediately got in touch with us as soon as he realized what he had done then later found a second vulnerability and reported that one the nice way Hats off to our winners tl dr If you see any wonky comments tell us P S Special thanks to David Parsons who is the author and maintainer of Discount and has just been an all-around great guy with respect to this big change He patiently and quickly

photos of his casemod projects and detailed visual archives of some amateur experiments in the field of recombinant DNA research It was a hell of a day for re it 's Engineering team 25 % of the department ( i e Chris ) was in New York on Conde Nast business -- I imagine him smoking cigars with bigwigs while everyone 's riding polo horses The rest of us ( David Jeremy and me ) were preparing for a road trip to the Googleplex to videotape the Peter Norvig AMA Right when our trio was getting ready to hit the road news broke that some re it users were seeing a pop-up ad right smack in the mi le of our site This was a surprise to us and wasn t even supposed to be possible but we had an appointment to get to so we pulled Chris away from I presume the squash court to handle things I ll pass the mic to him to explain how it went So honestly the first thing I thought when I saw that post on the front page was oh - % I 'm going to have to bludgeon myself to death with my own keyboard because if I don t someone is going to remind me that I said I would About half a second later I thought well I 'm doomed but I can at least save the site from further abuse 's o I shut off all site-wide ads post haste and hoped that this would give us a chance to figure out what had happened Soon after we figured out that this was what we will refer to as a whoopsie on the part of our ad systems and that we had accidentally started running ads from another of our parent company 's sites ( yes that 's what advertising looks like on other parts of the internet It is considered normal Please buy a T-shirt ) The issue was fixed before we had noticed it but the damage was done We ve decided internally that the best possible fix for this will be to run the ad unit from an lt iframe gt on a separate domain which will prevent it from busting out by browser security rules ( kind of like what we do currently on video embeds ) There was nothing malicious involved This was apparently a feature of that ad campaign though it was not intended for us This was all done in the bit of time I had between meetings Oh and before I forget don t believe what your manservant tells you polo is overrated Mike here again Meanwhile back in Mountain View the rest of the team had met up with Peter and after a terrific lunch on Google 's dime grabbed a conference room and began the interview As Murphy 's Law would have it the site starting acting funny right around the time Jeremy pressed Record We noticed that our silenced phones seemed to be vibrating a lot more than usual and so David and I quietly checked things out as best we could while Jeremy ran the show (W hen we post the video you may notice the sound of some frantic off-camera typing ) As soon as the taping was finished we started discussing the anomaly Within a minute or two of us flipping our ringers back on all of our phones started simultaneously making the re it is in -really- big trouble noise The site was down we didn t even have time to give our hosts a proper goodbye but instead asked if we could sit in the parking lot and mooch some more WiFi Google 's hospitality however was exemplary they invited us to sit on couches in their lobby for as long as we wanted and help ourselves to all the WiFi we needed We set up an emergency base of operations next to the reception desk and got Chris on the horn as well David and Jeremy had brought their laptops along but mine was 45 minutes away back at re it HQ so I had to commandeer one from a generous passerby (Y ou know who you are Thanks ) After an hour of rushed coast-to-coast debugging we had patched things up well enough to survive the trip home It had been an exciting day and the Googleplex is every bit the nerd utopia it 's reported to be It 's the sort of place where one can leave a laptop sitting on the floor unattended and know that not only is it perfectly safe but that nobody 's going to bat an eyelash over it For more information see Our

It 's been a long time and I 'm proud to say I 'm back writing again Finally managed to catch a match proper on a weekday at an ungodly hour of 4am Liverpool up against Arsenal who ve slumped to defeats at the hands of Man United and Chelsea And their respond to the defeats came just in time On a night when Man Utd drew and Chelsea lost In a surprising turn of event Arsenal managed to claw their way back into title contention while Liverpool could only watch as the top three teams surging further and further away from them After a good run of results including 6 clean sheets in 7 a game at the Emirates still proved to be a challenged The Reds have an abysmal record against Arsenal whether is it a home or away game and just the mention of Andrei Arshavin would have many of you cringing already Once again another visit to the Emirates and another empty handed trip down south A lapse of concentration from Liverpool 's defence was enough to give Arsenal the win At the highest level of football that was all that is required A mistake and a reaction that is milliseconds slow Tomas Rosicky was able to provide after a good move down the right and his cross was met by an unmarked Abou Diaby in the 75th minute He rose unchallenged in the Liverpool penalty box after evading some slack marking from substitute Philipp Degen The Swiss honestly doesn t impress me at all for the longest of time He replaced Jamie Carragher midway through the second half and there I thought Oh no disaster waiting to happen Sure it did He 's not the fastest and prone to some niggly fouls throughout He 's constantly out of position due to his attacking sense and just-run-forward mentality There was an occasion where Liverpool was nearly punished due to him running blindly forward leaving a huge gap behind Well let 's be honest Degen wasn t the only one who was bad I guess I 'm still not impressed with the performance of Maxi Rodriguez but I shall give him a benefit of a doubt due to his recent arrival and the need for him to acclimatise and familiarise himself with the team David N gog proved to be a spectator throughout and when he 's called into action during that one-on-one situation he panicked and William Gallas was able to make a last ditch tackle That was probably Liverpool 's best chance Steven Gerrard though posed some threat but wasn t able to impose himself His attitude didn t help either Don t know if it 's me or he just struts around expecting perfect passes for him One stray pass and he just flings his arms with disappointment like a kid with his toys taken away from him To be honest a draw will be a fair enough result as both teams didn t look threatening at all and were not at their best But Arsenal was able to compound on the slip-up in Liverpool 's defence and made them pay Who said Arsenal weren t clinical This was a show of them playing not as beautifully as they always do and yet still win Written by Gareth Freeman a sports writer promoting Irish racing and racing tips for today nbsp Tuesday night 's win over Aston Villa may not have been the best game of football ever played but on that particular night the result was all that counted Neither side played particularly well and the closest we came to a goal in normal time was probably a couple of penalty shouts that were waved away However deep into stoppage time Fernando Torres popped up with a crucial goal and wrote himself into Liverpool folklore His 50th Premier League goal saw him become the fastest player in the Reds history to reach that mark in the Premier League (72 games ) and gave Rafael Benitz and co a massive boost in terms of a Champions League place The festive period overall was a decent time for Benitez The loss to Pompey was as upsetting as it was shocking but since then Liverpool have recorded back to back wins over Villa and Wolves and have closed the gap at the top The Reds now lie four points adrift of Tottenham in fourth who are the next league opponents on January 10 Following the victory over Villa the game against Spurs is now massive and Liverpool have a great opportunity to push on and break into the Champions League places Another bonus has been the emergence of Alberto Aquilani The Italian has now played in the last two games and against Wolves especially looked a quality player He perhaps hasn t set the world on fire just yet but it can take time to settle into the Premier League and with time he could be a massive boost for Liverpool 's European hopes Steven Gerrard has had his fair share of criticism so far this season but he did put in a great display against Wolves No one aside from Torres shone against Villa in all fairness but for a team to play badly and still beat one of their nearest rivals is not necessarily a bad thing Captain Gerrard believes it will be difficult but remains confident the club can secure a top-four spot He said :\ We ve virtually got everyone back fit now so there are no excuses now We need to go on a run of winning games Can we secure a top-four spot It is going to be difficult There are a lot of fantastic teams about I am sure teams will spend in January It will be a race to the very end and we ve got to make sure we are in it A possible switch to Barcelona has proved an extremely drawn out transfer saga for Javier Mascherano I can t remember exactly when the rumours started but there were rumblings throughout the summer and despite the window closing when the season began it has still hit the news on a fairly regular basis We ve been told he has demanded a move a deal is already in place and that there are no foundations to the rumours at all so what do we believe In truth the speculation doesn t really matter until the player says something a factor that has been lacking in this particular saga until now Masch hasn t actually said he wants to leave and has stated he is committed to playing well for Liverpool However he hardly expresses his desire to stay with the club and his comments are unfortunately very ambiguous I am playing for Liverpool I am a Liverpool player and like the manager says I have two more years on my contract and don t have to say anything else explained Masch I play for Liverpool and will continue to do my best See what I mean Perhaps I 'm being overly negative ( I hope so ) but to me these are quite worrying comments and he could well be on his way if not in January perhaps next summer Should the Argentine decide to depart Anfield it would perhaps not impact as greatly on the club as the loss of Xabi Alonso did Mascherano is a great combative midfielder and capable of breaking up the opponents play as well as starting moves of his own but it is a role where there are plenty of candidates to replace him Barcelona 's Yaya Toure could possibly be part of a swap deal and in all honesty I think he is probably a better player Lucas will have another season under his belt and he is starting to improve In the Premier League Sunderland 's Lee Cattermole could be a good option should Masch decide to move on Liverpool 's standing at the end of the season may prove a decisive factor for Mascherano If the Reds can finish in the top-four or win the FA Cup or Europa League he may opt to stick with Rafael Benitez The player himself hasn t given up hope of a ing some silverware to his trophy cabinet at the end of the campaign He a ed :\ It is not a good season but everything can change and in May we could be talking about Liverpool winning something Written by Gareth Freeman a sports writer promoting betting tips and Irish racing Everton nbsp 0 Liverpool nbsp nbsp 2 (Y obo 12 og Kuyt 80 ) Football Funny old game You just got to feel for Everton They got the short end of the stick this time and despite putting in a fairly decent performance and troubled Liverpool well enough still they slump to a undeserving 2-0 defeat to their bitter city rival With almost a dozen of players out injured the patched up Everton side were firmly in control throughout the game and if not for some terrible finishing and Pepe Reina 's miraculous saves the result could ve been so different But I guess that 's what football is about It 's not the amount of chances Not how well or how beautiful the link-up plays are It 's just putting the ball into the back of the net Everton had the chance but unfortunately blew it Liverpool meanwhile dared to try and twice they did twice they scored Fortunes sometimes does favour the brave With Rafa Benitez 's men knocked out of Champions League the Reds entered this week at all-time low Everton must ve thought it 's the perfect time for them to put one past their city rivals But lady luck decided to shine on Liverpool that particular day I can t remember any one with the red jersey actually testing Tim Howard or posed any threats to his goal But still he had to pick the ball out of his net twice Not known for scoring goals Javier Mascherano tried a low drive which came off Joseph Yobo and Howard had totally no chance You could tell how important that goal was for Liverpool from the Argentinian 's celebration He went berserk And it definitely lifted the away side nbsp But still Liverpool were very much pinned to their own half and were playing cautiously most of the time David Ngog the sole front man was left isolated up top and had little support His first derby game was probably a forgettable one as he was out-muscled by Yobo and Heitinga Steven Gerrard Less said about him in this game the better He looked totally out of form and provided zero support for the inexperienced David Ngog A leader on the pitch in physical sense but I ve never seen him this subdued for quite a while Did he miss Torres this much The Spanish hotshot 's absence meant that Liverpool 's goalscoring threat diminished Other players have to step up and guess who It 's always going to be Dirk Kuyt The Dutch striker although a little over-enthusiastic sometimes proves to be a reliable player and no wonder Rafa Benitez values him so much It was his goal-poaching instincts that brought about the second goal which effectively finished the game off But before I go into the goal I must say the introduction of Albert Riera and Yossi Benayoun did change the game in favour of Liverpool The duo caused problems for the Everton defence giving the Reds a little more width and creativity It was the presence of the extra attacker which Everton failed to handle and again Joseph Yobo blundered gifting Riera an opportunity to take a pot shot Howard spilled the ball and Kuyt was at the right place right time to slot home Despite not being a spectacle and in fact a rather uncomfortable match to watch as a Liverpool fan it was a very very important win for Liverpool The team went through a really rough patch recently and the ugly and undeserved win was actually a welcoming one It will definitely boost the morale and propel them to close and gap and fight for a top 4 finish this season We ve been saying nearly every week that whoever the Reds are playing it is a must win game and the visit of City to Anfield is as big as any game Liverpool have faced this season Mark Hughes side are one point and one place above Liverpool and a win over the blue half of Manchester would go along way to restoring some faith in Rafael Benitez and his Liverpool squad The massive bonus for Benitez is the fact that Steven Gerrard has ruled himself fit for the fixture with City This is what the Liverpool captain has had to say :\ I ve had a problem in my groin that has taken a while to get over but I 'm just relieved the second injection seems to have done the trick It 's a case of so far so good and the aim now is to make sure I get a good week 's training under my belt so I 'm ready for the game with City Great news about Gerrard but striker Fernando Torres will play no part as he struggles with an abdominal strain Yossi Benayoun and Albert Riera are also ruled out while Glen Johnson Daniel Agger and Fabio Aurelio are all doubtful ahead of City 's visit It remains to be seen whether we ll get to see Alberto Aquilani or not but with Gerrard back in the fold this is certainly a winnable game for Liverpool City will be without winger Martin Petrov while Robinho and Gareth Barry are also listed as doubtful but they have plenty of players to cover and expect a strong line-up At a guess I would say City will probably line up with Emmanuel Adebayor Carlos Teve and Craig Bellamy in attack a formidable line up to say the least However Tevez has never been the most prolific striker in front of goal Adebayor has suffered a dip in form since his antics against Arsenal and Bellamy can be a bit hit and miss The game has all the makings of a classic Liverpool need to win to keep up with the chasing pack at the top of the table while City have something to prove against the bigger clubs after all their summer spending I 'm not going to hazard a guess at the result as on paper it is a bit close to call I do think we re in for a great game though and with home advantage Liverpool should be the favourites Written by Gareth Freeman a sports writer promoting horse racing Ireland and the Aintree Grand National 2010 for Betfair There seems to be almost constant speculation in regards to defensive midfielder Javier Mascherano 's Liverpool future On what feels like a daily basis a story emerges about a possible transfer to Barcelona with some sections of the media going as far as to state he is certainly heading to Camp Nou in January in a 36million deal However Spanish sports publication Sport has today reported that there is no concrete foundation to the rumours The player himself has apparently voiced his dislike of the English lifestyle and climate but for a player earning so much money and being a regular in the starting eleven at a club like Liverpool surely this is a small price to pay ( although granted the weather is terrible ) Unless Mascherano hands in a transfer request then I just can t see Rafael Benitez selling him Another point to consider is the World Cup in South Africa next summer Masch is a regular in the Argentina national side and he will retain his place in Diego Maradona 's midfield as long as he is playing regular first-team football At Anfield he is pretty much guaranteed a starting place but a move to Barcelona may see him sat on the sidelines until he has settled into the side and I doubt the 25-year-old would want to put his World Cup spot in jeopardy Sport have claimed to have been in contact with both Barca and Liverpool with both denying they have been in contact with regards to the player If this is true it would seem as if there is no truth in the speculation linking Masch with a move to Camp Nou There are a couple of other transfer rumours doing the rounds here is a quick run through them Carlton Cole It has been reported that both Liverpool and Manchester United are battling it out to sign West Ham 's Carlton Cole who is valued at 20million There could be some truth in this as Liverpool could certainly do with another striker whether the Hammers would be willing to let him go or not remains to be seen Ryan Shawcross Again United have also been linked with Shawcross but the defender has just agreed a contract extension at Stoke and it seems unlikely he will head to Anfield or Old Trafford anytime soon Simon Kjaer This 20-year-old defender has been getting rave reviews for is performances at Serie A side Palmero However the club don t want to sell the Danish stopper and if a move does materialise it will be next summer Eljero Elia Hamburg 's Dutch winger only made the switch to the Bundesliga in the summer but is already attracting interest Reports suggest the Reds will make a 15million move in January with Ryan Babel possibly heading the other way Eduardo Arsenal striker Eduardo has been linked with a 10million switch to Anfield in January for me this is just pure speculation and I can t see this one happening at all to be totally honest Written by Gareth Freeman a sports writer promoting Irish racing and racing tips for today for Betfair So much promise and yet Liverpool 's title hopes seemed to have imploded even before the league reaches its quarter mark It was definitely a depressing view for most fans as the shocking 3-1 lost to Fulham seemed to have marked an end of the road for the Reds and their title ambition After a morale boosting 2-0 win over Man Utd last week it looked as though things could only get better as Liverpool endured through a Black October with 4 consecutive losses But by the 80 th minute Liverpool and Rafael Benitez seemed to have taken this game so lightly that it all seemed like a pre-season friendly or they ve already won the title Nathan Ecclestone Philip Degen Daniel Ayala In a Premiership match where so much mattered Is Rafa having a laugh here Liverpool 's defence had been undeniably shaky since the start of season and I personally can t remember the number of times we actually kept a clean sheet It was the same at Craven Cottage as we saw how Bobby Zamora albeit not the best striker in the land in any sense ran rings round a dejected and tired-looking Jamie Carragher After his heroics last week Carragher was back to his early season form and it 's no wonder he was sent off for bringing down Zamora He was outpaced and outsmarted and he had no options Neither did the referee But the referee did had a questionable decision when he sent off Philip Degen for a awful looking but non-malicious tackle It was one of those moments where you ll turn towards your friends and ask what the heck But referee 's decisions aside it was an awful awful game from Liverpool 's point of view Other than Fernando Torres who has su enly turned into Steven Gerrard circa pre-Torres era the rest cannot be spared from any sort of criticism What happened to that team that looked so good at Anfield a week ago Is Liverpool suffering from a post-natal depression of a bipolar disorder I would go for the latter With decision to remove goalscorer Torres in the 60 o minutes the strange bipolar performances of the team could be attributed to Mr Rafa Benitez himself Let me make myself clear I do love this man But I guess it 's time for him to go Many more would join me in this bandwagon IF we don t make it through to the Champions League knockout stage this Wednesday It is not only a do-or-die match for Liverpool and their European ambition but also it 's his job right there on the guillotine Probably things have gone a little stale at Anfield and many are getting impatient It 's year after year of the same old except for last season where we finished high up and it smelled like title this season But the Anfield faithfuls have to endure yet another disappointing and probably trophy-less season The over-achievement of last season could ve been an a ed pressure on Benitez a limestone hung around his neck A ed on to these are the miraculous 2005 Champions league win and the 2006 FA Cup Thereafter it 's years of wilderness and there seemed no stopping of Liverpool walking further into the desert and hypothetically could ve turned into a team that is only motivated enough to beat their fierce rivals Sounds like Man City before Thaksin I personally think that there 's no more turning back for Rafael Benitez Even if Liverpool does triumph over Lyon this coming Wednesday that probably does not change the fact that there is a huge change needed at Liverpool I know the club represents and stands for stability seeing the number of managers actually sacked from the club But I can t bear to see the club going down this way I 'm not a doomsday merchant or a knee-jerk reactor I 'm just a little jaded and want to see some changes in the club For now 5 losses in 11 games We can realistically count ourselves out of the title race and focus on at least getting into the top 4 If Man City are to maintain this sort of form it could be quite a challenge and it will be pretty embarrassing to say the least So what will be Liverpool 's response this Wednesday I sincerely hope it 's not going to be another limp and half-hearted performance I really really hope not By Gareth Freeman The result last weekend was undoubtedly a huge one for Rafael Benitez and his Liverpool side Beating the old enemy and closing the gap between the top sides as vastly important for Liverpool but it will count for very little if they don t take all three points off Fulham on Saturday Craven Cottage is often a hard place to go but fingers crossed Steven Gerrard should be back in action and we may finally get too see Italian Alberto Aquilani for the first time in the league Fulham should not be dismissed though as they have some decent players themselves Liverpool may be the heavy favourites with the online betting o 's and rightly so but the Cottagers have the talent to cause an upset In defence Norwegian Brede Hangeland has established himself as a top class centre-half and is also capable of popping up with a goal or two from set plays His displays for Fulham have led to interest from the likes of Spurs and Arsenal and he is a difficult man to pass His defensive colleagues such as Aaron Hughes Chris Baird and John Panstil are perhaps not of the same standard and there are holes in the Fulham back line Fulham boss Roy Hodgson has built a very well organised and efficient side at Craven Cottage In midfield players such as Clint Dempsey and Damien Duff have plenty of quality and on their day they re capable of competing with anyone as they showed by coming back from two down to draw with Manchester City The one area they are lacking a bit of bite in my opinion is in attack Striker Bobby Zamora has a good all round game he runs the lines and holds the ball up well but his scoring record is not as impressive as perhaps it should be He seems to have lost a bit of confidence in front of goal and missed an absolute sitter against City which was a shame as otherwise he had a really good game It won t be a stroll in the park for Liverpool but I wouldn t bet against them at Fulham After the great result against Manchester United they should head into this full of confidence despite their Carling Cup exit With Gerrard fit again Torres in form and Aquliani 's league debut imminent the Reds should push on from here and three points at Fulham would go a long way to proving their doubters they can still compete with the best in the league 
For the 7 of you who are still reading this blog you may have noticed that i am on hiatus I 'm getting married in less than two weeks plus Polish girl and i have just closed on a house So i am very busy with a little bit of busy a ed on top of that This blog is on hold for now and hopefully one day five six years from now I ll get it back up and running again My mind is still humming and i still have blog entries dancing around my head Unfortunately i do not have the time to sit down and write them out in neat blog prose till we meet again Historelli This past weekend Nik Social and I ( with several others ) aided in the eventual release of a gargoyle We were guided by master carver Franco Minervini who showed us how to work limestone on a model of a humanoid griffin The actual gargoyle sits atop the National Cathedral in Washington where Master Minervini worked during the late 1980s Stone carving is the reverse of molding because instead of putting material together to create a figure you must take bits and pieces away to free a form Besides the difference in technique working stone is much more profound and permanent compared to clay or even paint Not only in the sense that the finished piece will most likely outlast the artist by centuries but also for the reason that the actual activity of shaping stone is primeval and ancient Even a beginner ( with any sense of geology ) can understand the connection Stone is eternal working it forces you to contemplate millennia Furthermore stone is rough and until coaxed properly unyielding A novice will swell his hands scrape his knuckles and breathe in dust before continuing And yet the finished product can be as refined and polished as the finest impressionist painting I wasn t sure what I would find before taking this stone carving workshop I did know that I wanted to better comprehend the craft and how it relates to my own roots Master Minervini stems from the city of Molfetta where my parents were also born and were 95 % of my known ancestors come from Minervini 's teacher at the National Cathedral was the late great carver Vincent Palumbo a fifth generation master whose family also ran shops in Molfetta Anyone whose been to Molfetta or even seen a picture of the place would not be surprised by the genesis of stone carvers the city initiates Comprised of sun-scorched limestone buildings Molfetta shines with a brightness that beautifully contrasts with the deep blue Adriatic and the surrounding olive groves Years ago its inhabitants fished the sea farmed the land or worked the stone All of my ancestors survived via these trades and I believe it is essential to experience these fundamentals in order to be healthy and fulfilled especially in today 's world of text messaging and reality shows A little bit of that old-world essence was at hand this past weekend Working with master Minervini caused limestone dust to fill the air which then combined with a distant aroma of cooking I thought to myself this smells familiar Shortly after Nik turned to me quizzically and said It 's weird but right now it almost smells like Molfetta There was this cigar bar lounge called Retailers where I spent entirely way too much time in during my early to mid-twenties My crew knew all the names of the more sizzling waitresses and they reciprocated our suave by giving us lots of free drinks and more importantly allowing us to stay later than the supposed 4 am closing hour Several evenings ended with navigations through morning rush hour after episodes of drinking through snifters and swivels One particular night my floral friend Cosmo pulled me away from the blond waitress I was working on and asked me if this guy he was talking to was really him Curious I walked over to the bar pressed my face into his visage and came to the conclusion that I was indeed staring at dancer extraordinaire Patrick Swayze I turned to Cosmo and replied Yeah that 's him Cosmo responded by purchasing shots of the most expensive of tequilas Now Johnny Castle was already half-zooted Apparently an altercation with his wife had caused him to go on a bender and by the time he got to us he had already assembled an entourage of young girls Asian men and one very insecure Italian restaurateur who acted like he was the actor 's keeper Cosmo continuously poured drinks for his new celebrity friend even forcing Swayze to call his mother up in Jersey and tell her that her son was really a good guy Since it was on the wrong side of 4 am I don t think mama Cosmo appreciated the gesture The rest of the night is sort of blurry to me As I sat in a corner table with my lady friend Cosmo assaulted the Italian guy imploring him to go home Then he took some curtains down and wore them as a cape Mr Chiapas who was still wet behind the ears at the time over-appreciated Mr Swayze with several bear hugs and even put his scarf around the actor 's neck and pulled it back and forth kinda like a burlesque dancer would do Now I do not encourage swooning over celebrities especially ones that were part of the epic drama Roadhouse However if you ever have the chance to sit back and relax while your friends chase down and manhandle a famous actor I strongly suggest you appreciate the situation Unfortunately Mr Swayze may not be long for this world so I would like to thank him now for a very funny night I love birds I don t know why exactly Maybe because when I was growing up the faraway places I saw on National Geographic were too out of reach so I settled for more suburban game When you re a kid interested in lions tigers and monkey-eating eagles it 's not easy to do field research Luckily I grew up with a big back yard with lots bugs and birds Not the same as the ones shown on TV but good enough I spent a lot of time out there learning the names of those bugs amp birds and even began to understand what eats what and all the other laws of nature afforded to a kid during summertime The bird thing has never gone away Just like baked ziti pin-striped uniforms and green-eyed girls I ve never lost my affinity for flying creatures Whenever I need to reclaim clarity I take a brief birding tour and put things back into perspective It doesn t hurt that most birds are out of human range When babbling brooks and warbling warblers replace cell phones and honking horns it 's easier to reach a Zen like state Bird watching is somewhat about lists Birders will go out of their way to seek out rare species or seasonal birds that only appear once a year during migration I too am guilty of this practice Last week a Eurasian subspecies of teal was spotted in the Meadowlands and I wandered toward the sighting with the hopes of checking it off on my life list The Eurasian Teal differs only slightly from our own Green-winged teal but since it is a variation of the regular native teal crazed birders need to go see it and check it off their lists However I know that the list thing is superficial and it was another bird that helped me realize this After checking the Eurasian teal off my list ( btw a teal is a type of duck ) I turned up the path and flushed a pair of decent sized long-eared owls Now there are a few things you should experience before the worms eat you One of those things is to stand face to face with a wild owl After withstanding the bright yellow-eyed glare of this creature I fully understand why owls are patrons of Halloween and also the symbol for wisdom If you move an owl will follow you with its gaze and if you blink it is so quiet you won t even know it flew away I literally froze in my tracks Needless to say the owl won the stare down and I went home to ponder my thoughts not really worried about much Let us recap According to the previous three-part epic atmosphere dictates mood and as a result any scary environment can create monsters Moreover ( if you re member a similar HSC post from October ) there is a difference between real fear and the nonsense type of panic that the television feeds us everyday Therefore if certain places are haunted ( that is if the actual essence of certain air is uniquely and unremittingly putrid something disgusting will eventually show up ) and within these authentically scary places lurk true monsters those who acknowledge this formula should surely experience the core spirit of the holiday But even if this is true is it wise to do so During Halloween we explore spooky scenes and give candy to dirty little children who show up to our door begging all in the merriment of the unknown which in its different forms can scare anyone Not the type of 's cared that puts butterflies in your stomach before the start of new job or the trepidation that chills the bones upon the realization that a child-molester like Curt Schilling will win another World Series This type of fear is more ancient Perhaps it is a primeval peculiarity we claim to want relief from but in reality just want a chance to tap into its source of ogreish orgasm We have all felt it but only a few of us have the penchant ability to turnkey it into something tangible I am curious about those who can truly translate Halloween A few weeks back Polish Girl and I paid homage to the home and grave of Washington Irving America 's first celebrity writer and creator of such characters like the Headless Horseman and Rip Van Winkle Originally from Manhattan Irving spent some of his childhood in the Tarrytown / Sleepy Hallow sections of Westchester County and the atmosphere of the place stuck with him for the rest of his life In fact when Irving wrote the Legend of Sleepy Hollow he was actually living in Spain but the reminder of his days in New York resonated so soundly within his memory he was able to cite specific locations and characters with little difficulty When visiting his home today ( now an historic landmark known as Sunnyside ) it is impossible not to get a taste of this specter It doesn t hurt that pumpkins and headless horsemen adorn the entire town a smart form of marketing by local residents trying to cash in on their most famous son Of course the people of Tarrytown did not invent the ghosts Irving wrote about since the original Dutch settlers only recognized what the Indians they encountered knew for centuries something is not quite right about that area near Sleepy Hollow Maybe it took a different mind ( like Irving 's ) to dissect what others realized but never had the ability to highlight On the other hand maybe those before Irving were just too frightened to do so Interestingly the frequency of ghosts is not something solely attributable to Sleepy Hollow or even New Orleans a place I recently visited that seems securely penetrated by the allure of goblins The truth is that we are all surrounded by the unfamiliar and nameless but either we are unable or just reluctant to obverse it For example my loyal readers like F White the Chiapas crew Nik Social Frank A and Mr amp Mrs Moe Green all live in a very very haunted town Evil has been enveloping its residents for decades In 1870 their home then known as Union Township was home to a sweet German woman until a bout of hallucinations caused her to attempt suicide and eventually land her in the Insane Asylum Nearly 50 years later this quiet little town located in the Meadowlands again made headlines when it 's Health Inspector gunned down a former mayor Later the Health Inspector slit his wrists and died in the bathroom of his home on Willow Ave I wonder if his ghost still haunts that street The crazies from this town seem to have ventured northward even infiltrating the territory of Sister Lucy and her family According to reports from 1924 a man named Solaski swallowed a chain of gold then went insane after the necessary stomach surgery After the operation he escaped from Hackensack Hospital and then beat down a bunch of police officers from the neighboring town They shot him seven times but he still lived I wonder if his energy is still running wild in that area My other readers may feel safe at this time but they aren t Across the river from the aforementioned place in the meadowlands fellow blogger Ricky may have to deal with flying ghostly body parts In 1929 a 20-year old bootlegger watched for police while his friends made some illegal booze Although I 'm not sure if they made any good hooch they did succeed in blowing up their house Authorities found the lookout guy in pieces nearly two blocks away Meanwhile Gus lives practically next door to the final resting place of Jennie Bosschieter a young pretty mill girl who was drugged assaulted then murdered by four wealthy businessmen from Paterson I wonder if anyone or anything still visits her grave Hmm who did I leave out AO needs to watch out for the ghosts of runaway slaves and cousin Marge should not go to Rite Aid late at night because she may encounter the phantom of 17-year old Christine Hervish Someone smashed her jaw then murdered her near that present location almost 85 years ago -Note when reading the newspaper articles click on the image to enlarge the print The bedroom furnishings were simple consisting of a bed a dresser and a nightstand Since the fittings were dusty and old we stopped short of unpacking our cloths and accessories opting instead to leave everything in bags atop of the furniture Regardless of grime it was a far better decision to remain temporary and offer no sense of permanence to this house Perhaps the original owner of the yellow suitcase thought this realm as a comfort only to remain here past comfortable That considered I resigned myself to the opinion that our bags would remain virtually unpacked and our stay a brief testament of our wits In the daytime two long windows provided ample light to this room denying the most mischievous shadow even a limited existence However upon nightfall every creature or passerby of the outside world cast the most ominous silhouettes upon the walls A tree swaying gently in the late summer breeze depicted itself as a colossal hobgoblin with outstretched arms trying to reach inside the window Visions of ghouls hunchbacked and racing hurriedly on the street below emanated from the outlines of teenagers escaping to the beach Street cars driving past with their lights ablaze caused the most fantastic carousel of illumination upon the walls The light would first hit the far wall stretch out against the ceiling and then finally fade upon that wretched hole in the corner where the cursed suitcase lay hi en Jealously I glanced at Barbara who was asleep and tranquil in all her snuggery How could she sleep with all the surrounding madness At this moment we risk abduction but still she slumbers I closed my eyes in hope for composure Slowly my breath became less erratic and my quickened pulse subdued Realizing the responsibilities of the morning I reluctantly reached over to the nightstand fumbled through some medicines and swallowed half a hand of Acetamophin It was breezy out on Grandma 's balcony but not enough that I needed a jacket Plus it was too much fun out here to worry about being cold Peering down onto the noisy street filled with tiny European cars was great entertainment especially since I was miles away from all my friends and action figures I didn t even notice the green shutters open but sure enough there was Great Aunt Chiara smiling at me confounded that I was outside without something covering my shoulders It 's not nice to be out here this time of year now blows the Sirocco 's he said It 's a bad wind that comes over the ocean and from the Sahara it could make you sick and it 's dangerous go inside You shouldn t be here you shouldn t be here A sharp rush of pain slammed into my head Something crashed upon me causing such su en discomfort that I cried out in agony gasping for air as I sat up in bed I reached my bandage-hand to my aching face and tried to make sense of what just happened Someone punched me I looked at Barbara but she was tucked-in so securely it would have taken her several minutes just to unwrap She couldn t have slapped me and then returned to sleep so swiftly Thoroughly shaken I felt my surely-wounded scalp and sensed for blood but I was unconvinced if it stemmed from my head or hand Slowly the intensity of the headache receded but still my eyes fought to accommodate the mouth-gaping stare into the darkness At this hour barely a car drove by to offer some light into the bedroom and even the breeze was fugitive In fact the sea air was not salty and fresh but instead thick and foul filled with sand and the fetid presence of kelpies The unmistakable sound of scratching nails on floorboard greeted me next At times it came from my right side and then switched to across the room near the door I scanned the landscape to no avail There was nowhere to focus my attention Then I heard the door of the storage room creak open Luckily the slow hum of a motorcycle was approaching the house With any providence the driver would direct his high beam squarely upon that miserable spot in the wall First shadows appeared then a flicker of a shine The room lit dimly enough to provide the scene of a clawed hand dexterously closing the door of the suitcase chamber I was astonished How did that raccoon get back into the house and how as I going to get it out of this room If I woke Barbara up she would freak out I would have to sweat this one out alone Again I waited this time for the sounds behind the storage room The creature scratched and jostled about until stopping su enly It had noticed me I was inching cautiously in its direction with the idea of trapping its exit with the night table Unfortunately this lively spirit realized my intention and now fixed its re ish gaze solidly upon my stance causing me to freeze in terror Not from fear of rabies or the scratching out of my eyes but because of how my visitor chose to greet me Instead of growling or hissing a warning this beast of torment gurgled out a clear discernible and human laugh I am not sure how Barbara dealt with sleeping here And alone for two nights An antechamber provided privacy to the actual bedroom but also ensured our isolation from the rest of the house If an entity first started in this room and worked its way downstairs three to four shouts would be necessary before help arrived If atrocities were first occurring elsewhere in the house those of us in this bedroom would be the last to know Even though further cut-off from its sister chambers this bedroom still shared the bizarre habit of left-behind décor When procuring a rental apartment of such age it is an accepted that many came before you and many others will follow Proper maintenance however should ensure that remnants of previous visitors are far and few between What was unsettling about this bedroom was that several personal effects remained within eyeshot of any vulnerable sleeper using the room Particularly of interest were the objects found in a storage cubicle carved out of the low portion of the far wall There was only half of a lock attached to half of a door so it was easy to peer inside the dark crevice Still there was not enough light to view the exact insides I tugged on the handle and after much exertion the door jarred open scraping my hand during the violent action The hollow was full of mostly falling debris from the infrastructure but also strewn with bits of newspaper and other detritus insulation The focal point was not this mess but rather a single yellow suitcase made slightly ajar by an overflow of clothing inside Cautious to reach my bloodied hand into such a dusty hole I warily rifled through the garments with a rolled up magazine Beneath the final layer of flannel was a letter handwritten on both sides of loose-leaf sheet The characters were finite and effeminate telling the story of a Barbara and how foolish she felt about expressing her love for Douglas Now this was not my Barbara but another more historic Barbara from perhaps forty years ago This ancient Barbara read like a jealous girl that went around in scripted circles before finally realizing upon the fact that her Doug had fallen for another woman Olden Barbara lamented that the length of cold weather and time spent away from the shore convinced Douglas to stray away from her and toward an unlucky someone named Jeane She wrote Am I a fool to hope you still love me Doug If it was because of Jeane can I now be less of a fool now that she is gone I paid her a visit last Sunday before the infection took her I am sorry that I was not able to ask her about my foolishness before she left but do not blame yourself or God Neither of you are to blame Satisfied that I received all that I could from this letter I went to place it down back inside the suitcase But before the paper fell into the bag the lid shut upon my already injured hand with such force that the sound of pinging metal resonated through the air Wounded I pulled my hand quickly away and slammed the door of this awkward closet shut Right after my Barbara arrived into the room finding me dirtied on the floor and wincing with pain Stop poking around and get to bed we have to wake up early tomorrow she said And open that window it smells like a stuffy hospital in here more soon I haven t even told Barbara this part of the story but there were definitely some strange happenings at the old shore house from last weekend Clearly atmosphere dictates occurrence I am now a true believer of that The more you think of a place as haunted the more things will appear Situated a mere block away from the beach Uncle Vince ascertained the house to be at least late 1800 's The creaking floorboards and low doorways confirmed his findings What was strange to me was the mish-mash of artifacts left behind by either the actual owners or the last renters Beheaded dolls yellowed photos letters suitcases filled with clothes even someone 's math homework from 1973 It was as if there was a horrible murder some thirty-o years ago and everyone fled in terror The a ress remaining shuttered until some wretched real estate agent looking for a quick turnover put it on the market The house had three floors mostly bedrooms intertwined with water closets and stairways As with many all old-estates it consisted of equal parts of either inhabited or empty quarters The most vacant territory belonged to the basement In its entirety the lowest level was a massive one encompassing the grand circumference of the house No open space since partitions separated corridors and walkways each cavity decorated with doors to nowhere freestanding walls and boxes upon boxes of decrepit utensils I tried to link the artifacts or make sense of the architecture but I was thoroughly ineffective in deciphering the purpose of these rooms A ing to my anxiety was the sense that the basement was tired of my presence My eyes strained against any attempts to soak up the surroundings as my brain fought all urges to retreat Finally the gusts of antique vapors made progress impossible and by the time Barbara called for me to return to the top of the stairs I was already in step toward her voice The day passed into nightfall away from the house with a fish supper followed by fine conversations about things passed and things upcoming The setting was a homely yet extremely comfortable eatery complete with clanging silverware and delicious comfort food While at the restaurant our peculiar accommodations did not raise itself within the dinner 's vernacular Why speak about the obvious Especially since we all knew returning there was inevitable and we were certain that any doubtful specters would remerge factual once lights were out Great fanfare greeted our arrival home A raccoon had scaled the roof tiles and made headway into the master bedroom via a balcony entrance Chocolates had enticed the creature indoors and it would have nested there if Uncle Vince didn t scare it away Drunk on sweets the animal actually remained on the outside terrace floor until it slept off its intoxication The lure of our own nightcaps downstairs drew us away from the scene and eventually the crowd sat contently watching TV while sipping an Apulian white Curious how comforting the television can be The flickering backlight pulsing away any apprehensions as the night ended Unfortunately it is improper to fall asleep on the couch so I forced myself to the lodgings of the top floor By Mauro Magarelli To be continued 
After almost 5 years and 1 112 posts I ve decided to put The BDR on indefinite hiatus It 's been a great ride I ve enjoyed almost every minute of it But the joy of discovering and sharing has over the

book do you really hate ) OK enough of looking at book covers for a day or two The Guardian 's Stuart Evers has written a very very funny article about the good side of bad books It 's a hoot and you should read it now But then you should come back here and tell us about the one ( or two ) novels that made you want to set yourself on fire punch yourself in the face or question why you learned to read in the first place I ll go first After being hounded by my sci-fi-inclined friends for years I read Robert Heinlein 's Stranger In A Strange Land When done I immediately went out and bought two hamsters and a cage so that something could rip that book apart and pee on it If there was an editor within 50 miles of that thing I ll eat my shorts I ll eat yours too I 'm not anti-science fiction I don t read a whole bunch of it but I don t have a problem with it per se J G Ballard holds a special place on my bookshelves But this book Ugh I wish I remembered more about why I hated it so deeply

want this to get lost in The Book Table 's favorite covers of 2009 post Jason from The Book Table wrote this I love it Jason have you seen this Our assignment was to pick 15 covers and comment on them if we wished We think the covers speak for themselves so instead of talking about them we want to mention what we think was the most amazing piece of book design of the year As much as we d like to choose Chip Ki 's design of The Original of Laura which we loved or any of the designs done by Chris Ware Oak Park 's very own genius we think the design of The Hemingses of Monticello is the best design of the year We know that most books that we sell in the store are sold because of their spine and we know that of the thousands of books in our home only a few at anytime have their covers displayed Because of this we spend a lot of time thinking about spines The Hemingses of Monticello is the first book that we ever remember seeing that has award medals on the spine It 's a brilliant idea and makes it irresistible to everyone that goes near it The third and final list of favorite covers from independent booksellers in this case hometown favorite The Book Table in Oak Park Illinois

selections from the staff of WORD in Brooklyn NY Three more lists ( including my selections ) are on the way The only guideline I asked the good folks at WORD to follow was to limit their selections to books published this year so I was glad to see them include some YA and children 's books -- I don t get around to discussing either genre very often I couldn t chase down all the design credits so if you know something I don t please set me on the right track so that I can give proper credit for this fantastic work And of course correct me if I ve gotten something wrong There 's a poll at the

City Out My Window :\ The only die-cut we will ever like in this store ( we hate die cuts because they inevitably rip on the floor no matter what you do with them and then nobody wants to buy them )

I start praying for a blackout so I can close early Of course it doesn t happen I 'm not gonna make it three more days I better get some Prozac soon They should start putting it in Red Bull Hmmmm Now there 's a million dollar idea Attention Waiter Rant has moved to www waiterrant net Attention Loyal Waiter Rant Readers Waiter Rant is going to be down for maintenance for a short time today The changes I hinted at earlier are coming soon I have worked 70 hours so far this week without a day off After I get some rest ( and time to write ) I ll post more new stories Baby Bucks I 'm tired Fluvio went on vacation and I 'm stuck minding the store I ve got seven more double shifts till he comes back I 'm worried It 's only Sunday and I 'm already punchy There are bags under my eyes and my cheeks ache from maintaining the customer friendly smile My feet hurt Every customer is becoming an obstacle to overcome I dread the phone Waiters constantly harass me with problems By the end of the week I ll probably be psychotic The Sunday rush ends The last tables are finishing their espressos Soon the Bistro will be empty I look at the clock Fifteen minutes till closing Thank God I want to be in bed before midnight I start doing my cashout I 'm wondering why the drawer is short ten bucks when the door chimes A youngish guy stands in the doorway Damn Can I help you sir I say cheerily but my heart isn t in it Can I get a drink and some take out the man asks The guy looks familiar I spin through my mental rolodex of faces Ah there he is Dan something or other Cute wife He proposed to her in my section two years ago I stuck the ring on a piece of tiramisu Now they re expecting their first child Tempus Fugit How 's your lovely wife sir I ask smiling at the memory of his spouse laden with child sweating like a pig in the July heat She had the baby earlier this evening he replies with a wan smile Congratulations I offer Thanks I can t help but notice this guy doesn t look entirely happy Mother and baby are both well I ask carefully Yeah they re both ok Jen was in labor for twenty four hours Yikes Now she wants Porcini Risotto from her favorite place he says I groan inwardly and pull out my dupe pad I have to let this guy get some food or my soul will burn in hell The kitchen guys are gonna be pissed So one Porcini Risotto Anything for you sir Just a Ketel One on the rocks Coming right up I put the risotto order in over protest and get the guy his drink Here you go I say handing the man a frosted highball glass He scarfs the vodka down greedily Want another I chuckle If I just had a kid I d drink too After a short pause New Dad replies No I 'm good Well it ll be twenty minutes until your entrée 's ready If you want another let me know I offer as I return to the cash drawer to find my missing ten bucks I start counting but stop Something 's not right Even with my back turned I can feel the tension coming off this guy in waves I 'm emotionally attenuated I guess Chalk it up to my years working in a psychiatric hospital I turn around New Dad 's knee is bopping up and down nervously His discomfort is making me anxious I decide to intervene So did you have a boy or a girl I ask A girl You poor man I say winking Tell me about it the man sighs God has an exquisite sense of justice sometimes doesn t he That provokes a laugh You re right the guy agrees Now you might think my comment 's inappropriate but it isn t Whenever men undergo a major life event like getting married or having a baby we guys tend to respond with a certain gallows humor For example my brother on his we ing day had to walk down a long dimly lit corridor to reach the main part of the church As we groomsmen walked behind him ostensibly to keep him from running away I was reminded of a line from a movie I couldn t help myself Dead man walking I cried out The guys cracked up The minister cracked up My brother smiled nervously and walked to the altar to await his bride Now he 's married and sipping beer on some beach in Maui with his beautiful wife My point Sometimes a little ribbing helps soothe a guy 's anxiety and snaps everything into proper perspective Usually And then there 's dating Oh man I continue saying to New Dad The guy 's laugh 's smaller this time Actually he looks like he 's about to throw up Ok so maybe gallows humor isn t the way to go A quiet minute passes The guy stares at the floor He take a deep breath like he 's about to say something He doesn t The clock ticks I see moisture in his eyes You ll be fine I say gently The guy wipes his face quickly Yeah I know he says but there 's so much to worry about I mean summer camp private school college You know what college is gonna cost in eighteen years No idea A million bucks he explodes That much I wonder skeptically And then there 's braces toys broken arms New Dad gushes as if a dam burst from within I recognize what 's happening When New Dad held his baby for the first time the enormity of what 's happening hit him He 's trying to process it all at once I don t have kids of my own but I have friends who do I ve seen how they ve handled it I know what to say I hope someone says it to me when my time comes It 's a lot of stuff but you ll break it down into small steps and it ll come together I offer quietly I guess New Dad says Think about everything at once and you ll go nuts I say just remember one day at a time Your right New Dad exhales Enjoy your little girl She 's only a baby once I finally see a real smile She 's beautiful he says I ll bet she is You have kids New Dad asks Me Hell no I just have joint custody of a dog You d be a good father I feel myself blushing Thank you sir How old are you Thirty seven I reply New Dad is about ten years my junior Well be sure you have them before it 's too late Sir I say clasping my hand on New Dad 's shoulder one of the great things about being a guy is we can still make babies twenty minutes after we re dead New Dad emits a soul cleansing laugh I have plenty of time I reassure him You re a funny guy New Dad says I try sir The food 's ready I slip a tiramisu gratis into the bag run the check and take the order to New Dad All set sir I say and since your wife likes tiramisu so much I threw one in on the house Thank you New Dad says shaking my hand You re very welcome The guy signs the check and leaves I watch him walk off into the night his life changed forever That kid 's gonna be all right When I open the checkbook and my exhaustion dissipates On a thirty dollar check the guy tipped me fifty bucks Totally unexpected As I close up the Bistro I can t wipe the grin off my face Baby bucks Ka-Ching I hope this guy has lots of babies Attention Waiter Rant has moved to www waiterrant net Please update your bookmarks and links to www waiterrant net To the Rescue I ve received a couple of aggrieved emails lamenting that I haven t written many posts this week I 'm grateful to have readers that eagerly await each post The readers as you can see by the comments are one of the major reasons why Waiter Rant 's traffic has steadily risen over the past months Thank you Normally I post two to three times per week This past week has been especially crazy for me My brother got married over the weekend Now Fluvio 'm y boss is going on vacation and I 'm going to be living at the Bistro for the next twelve days That 's right I 'm gonna have to drag my laptop to work Right now this instant I 'm sitting to write a post when Fluvio calls Hello Get over here Gwen is throwing up all over the place Oh that 's appetizing I groan and look at the clock It 's too early to be hearing this shit So what do you want me to do I ask The restaurant is full and I have no one to work Fluvio says I can hear the near panic rising in his voice Can Gwen hold on till I get there I ask I don t think so I sigh deeply I wanted to post today But I ve got a job to do I ve got to go now I 'm on my way boss I say Off to the rescue Again Thanks Fluvio says hanging up Folks - I ve got to go I 'm a waiter after all Have a nice weekend New stories next week Attention Waiter Rant has moved to www waiterrant net Please change your links and bookmarks to www waiterrant net Thanks Lawyer Blog It is the trade of lawyers to question everything yield nothing and to talk by the hour - Thomas Jefferson Over the past couple of weeks I ve been reading Opinionistas a blog written by a young female lawyer in NYC In a ition to her describing life as an indentured billable hour servant replete with grueling hours and impossible workloads she also describes colleagues sloughing off their youthful idealism as they struggle inside the pressure cooker environment of a major law firm I particularly liked this entry - Casting That Stone It 's about how some women seem to abandon their hard earned professional lives in pursuit of safe boring marriageable men Opinionista wonders if women have evolved if at all during the past sixty years of feminist awareness But what I really like about this blog is that you get the sense the author is in the midst of a psychological struggle of her own In her world of high priced graduate schools expensed lunches and status hungry sycophants everyone is constantly comparing themselves to everybody else Do I make enough money Am I more successful Why is she married and not me Who 's got a corner office Why did that associate get the deal It can be a toxic soul eroding landscape that not everyone survives with decency intact Its obvious Opinionista has second thoughts about being a lawyer Her ambivalence permeates the entire blog and you wonder what she ll end up doing Will she chuck her expensive law school degree Or will she make whatever accommodations she needs to make within herself to remain a lawyer It 's a process all professionals struggle with when they realize the career they ve dreamed about since high school isn t all it 's cracked up to be Well written and humorous - I recommend you check Opinionista out The author does question everything but yields insights into a slice of life we might otherwise have never known about Go read My Name is Clark Kent Now that I 'm thirty-seven I need glasses in order to read Not prescription eyewear just a good set of readers you can pick up at any pharmacy Years of reading books peering into computer monitors and working in low lighting have taken their toll At least the glasses lend me a professorial air I 'm constantly taking the glasses on and off I 'm always reading something a dupe pad the POS monitor or an order form Sometimes I 'm wearing them tableside Sometimes I 'm not This occasionally leads to confusion A four top sits in my section I 'm wearing my glasses I go to the table special cocktail them and take their order When I deliver the apps I ve taken the glasses off Excuse me a rather distinguished looking man says Could you ask our waiter to come over here Huh I am the waiter I beg your pardon sir I ask Could you get the waiter with the glasses I stifle a laugh Without my spectacles this guy thinks I 'm a completely different person Right away sir I reply I duck out of sight and put my glasses back on I return to the table How can I help you sir I d like another Manhattan please the man asks I make a little bow and go to make the man 's drink I take my glasses off and deliver the cocktail to him Who wanted the Manhattan I call out It 's for me the man signals As I place the drink in front of him he peers at me intently Hey you re the same guy the man yelps Actually my evil twin works here too I guess you ve met him I reply winking The table busts out laughing Arthur it 's always been the same guy You re the one who needs glasses his wife teases Chagrined the man take a sip of his drink Your other brother is the handsome one he says Touche my brother Touché I put my glasses back on The table 's cracking up So I look better with the glasses on I ask Actually nothing can improve your mug the man ripostes I like this guy He 's customer you can screw with An optometrist eats in our bistro almost every day He 's left us a pile of business cards I leave the table and go and fetch one Returning I hand the card to Arthur the Blind Call this guy He can help you pick out a nice pair I say triumphantly Ok ok the man says waving his hands in surrender If I may say sir you desperately need them I continue The table is in stitches I like your other brother better Arthur laughs Make sure you leave him a nice tip I counter Arthur 's wife turns to me and says You are the first waiter to ever give it back to him Good for you Lady I 'm letting him off easy For everything there is a first time I say The table finishes dinner I hand the check to Arthur sans spectacles Here you go sir Please don t be mad at my brother He 's a bad bad waiter The man chuckles and takes the checkbook When I return the book is stuffed with cash That 's all for you Arthur says smiling Thank you sir I move out of sight and count out the bills On a 200 check I get fifty bucks Righteous The table gets up to leave I thank the man for his generosity You re a good sport sir I say You really threw me with the glasses Well sir I say opening the door for him now I know how Clark Kent got away with it for so long The man roars with laughter and walks out into the humid night As I watch him go I realize Clark Kent and I have a lot in common Like the reporter from the Daily Planet I too have a secret identity to protect Mild mannered waiter by day Superblogger by night Hey I ve always wanted to be a superhero I think I ll indulge myself in that delusion for a while Just call me Clark Kent Now where 's a phone booth 
I ve spent the last few days sick ugh Hoping today is better I think I ll read comics for a bit and then tackle work More sketches to accompany a short story I wrote An amazing band covering an amazing song originally done by New Order Theodor Kittelsen is an artist like John Bauer that deserves wider recognition in the English speaking world Kittleson also like Bauer is primarily known as a troll artist as his best known work was illustrations for books on Norwegian folklore Unlike Bauer whose work is filled with unthreatening and friendly trolls Kittelsen monsters are darker more mysterious and much more frightening These works are amazing and haunting and have had a huge impact on me A sketch I did of Atha Not a lot to say this morning We re feeding Henry and it 's really windy and wet out I 'm off to play RPGs this afternoon Plan to check out comic shop called The Hairy Tarantula That 's it A pretty amazing sword amp sorcery romp I can t believe I ve never read it before Moore 's writing is quite good not overwrought like some pulp stuff The book also feels pretty fresh and original Not a lot female characters in the sub-genre have been quite like this I was disappointed she only wrote this handful of Jirel stories Some sketches for an upcoming book cover I 'm working on The above picture I did to as a sample for a job It was rejected by the author because he thought the coyote wasn t sly enough This was one of Canada 's most famous writers Ouch I got over it I don t really like his books anyway I got such great responses to my post on rejection a few days ago I thought I d post some quotes from them here Russel Dickerson said there 's no one on Earth harder on my work than I am The actual rejections I ve received haven t said anything worse than I ve already thought Glendon Mellow send them more artwork A change in editorial personnel or style or even just the right art at the right time may see the relationship change for the positive Rod McKie Bide your time Eric the best revenge is living well Charlene I don t think they mean you suck which is probably where the sting comes from for most of us Dave Howlett Best you can do is believe in yourself and that what you are doing is both worthwhile and something that you would enjoy reading yourself Certainly no editor should be able to discourage that whatever their reasoning Grimalkin Press PROVE THEM WRONG Madeline Carol Matz rejection letters is like an actor not getting a callback for a part Viviane Schwartz Ah you can t please them all If the illustrations they generally use look really different from yours than that 's just what they re set on using - It 's really frustrating 
Same old same new A senior Iraqi spy has accused the prime minister Nour al-Maliki of handing out thousands of guns to tribal leaders in a bid to win votes The claim was made by Iraqi National Intelligence Service former spokesman Saad al-Alusi a week before Iraq 's general election in which allegations of vote buying and exorbitant handouts have become widespread Maliki who faces a bitterly contested final week of campaigning ahead of the7 March poll has been photographed handing out guns to supporters in southern Iraq engraved with a personal message from his office However he denies that the delivery of weapons along with cash payments were improper Alusi who was the INIS spokesman until he was asked to move to another ministry eight days ago said some 8 000 guns were ordered from a Serbian supplier at the end of 2008 for use by intelligence officers However he claimed Maliki denied our contract at the last minute and made his own contract of 10 000 pistols which he has used as election propaganda for himself and his party More test Muntadhar al-Zaidi I have customized high-detail maps of tribal groups and clans in Iraq and neighboring border areas for sale to researchers There are several hundred different clans depicted on the map Some lower quality previews here and here Contact me for pricing and availability Who are these people offering to sell millions of barrels of Iraqi crude oil online at discount prices Who is behind them Who is allowing them to continue to do this Meet the new Mohammed Sa id al-Sahhaf There is little to no coverage of this but these eight young men were the security guards of the Zuwiyya branch of al-Rafidain Bank at the Jadiriya district of Baghdad The small bank is located just across the river from the Green Zone and a few hundred yards away from the residences of Hakim Adil Abdul Mahdi and Badr Brigade ( now members of the Presidential Brigade ) checkpoints They were tied up and killed execution-style by a group of officers who were members of Vice President Adil Abdul Mahdi 's security detail on their own turf in Jadiriya The incident was carried out on July 28 after midnight A huge portion of the stolen money ( 4 5 million ) was then located at the offices of al- Adala ( justice ) newspaper ( which as you guessed is owned by Abdul Mahdi ) In fact it turns out that the two officers who were in charge of the heist were not arrested but have already fled Iraq ( who helped them flee ) PM Maliki has stepped in to cover up for his partners in crime once more and all public debate of the incident has been stifled Iraqis seem to have been shocked by the brutal crime and its implications but nothing more than that The outrage of a few brave journalists ended just two days after the incident and now everyone is warning against rushing to conclusions or using the incident as an excuse to defame our politicians and Islamic symbols ( whatever that means ) I don t think the symbolism of the crime was missed by Iraqis I rule over you and plunder your wealth while you live like animals and I will tie you up blindfold you and shoot you in the head at will because I can get away with it Rule of law mal teezi as we say in Iraq However we the Iraqis will bend over once more and take it up the behind from our rulers as we have always done throughout our history That 's all - Sorry for the unannounced absence Will start posting again regularly once I 'm finished with my dental board exams In the meantime as an alternative to the depressing developments in Iraq and the Mi le East you may be interested in cleaning out your ears with some classical and traditional Iraqi music from the old days Iraqi Maqam 
The word permanent appears on many different art products but it 's a confusing term On many graphic art products such as inks or felt-tipped markers it really means waterproof rather than lightfast Many calligraphy or fountain pen inks such as the brown inks in the drawing above are not waterproof but they re reasonably lightfast considering that most handwriting isn t usually subjected to light for long periods The sketches are for sky galleys part of the planning for Waterfall City from Dinotopia A Land Apart from Time Here 's what the Calvin Theater looked like in 1995 The sketch is in pencil and marker First let 's have a look at a video What you ll see is a visualization of three different color schemes as 3D shapes floating within the RGB color space ( If this embe ed video doesn t play try this link to YouTube ) Each painting will be followed by an irregular shape that represents the range of colors used within that composition If you ve read this blog for a while or dug back in the archives you may remember seeing how we can chart a color scheme as a shape or gamut that takes up part of a color wheel Everything outside the gamut is left out of the composition The painting Palace in the Clouds above has a gamut limited to intense blue opposed by fairly dull reds and yellows and some fairly dull dark greens To the right of that is a computer-generated image made by sampling all the pixels and charting them on a color wheel The software was created by Phillipe Colantoni and is available for Windows users at couleur org We can also combine the value or lightness data to see the color scheme as a 3D representation inside an RGB cube The RGB color space is created by graphing red green and blue as three separate vectors in XYZ space (T he green vector above is hi en by the gamut ) Where the vectors intersect is pure black At the opposite corner is pure white In this configuration the secondaries are cyan magenta and yellow which would lie on the plane between each of the two vectors A pure yellow for example would be on the plane formed by red and green ( the horizontal plane in this view ) By comparing each of the paintings with its gamut in RGB color space and then comparing the gamuts to each other you can see how the gamuts vary The gamut for Crocodile Swamp is narrower because the color scheme is more limited There are hardly any blues The yellow windows in this scene show up as a scattering of yellow dots at the bottom of the gamut ------ Software by P Colantoni at couleur org Animation by Lester Yocum at lesteryocum com Previously on GurneyJourney Color Wheel Masking Update We take for granted that our experience of vision results from the interaction of light with objects It 's obvious isn t it Light shines on objects bounces off them and then it stimulates our eyes But for thousands of years that basic concept was not understood People only knew was that there was some sort of connection between the eyes and the objects seen During the time of Aristotle in the fourth century BC one school of thought held that the eyes emitted a visual fire that traveled to the object and somehow massaged it Others believed that objects gave off a substance that flew toward the eye These notions persisted until the time of Leonardo who objected to the idea of fire from the eyes He said there wouldn t be time after opening the eyes for the fire to leave the eyes and travel all the way to a distant object and return Others reasoned that if the objects gave off a flaming substance why can t we see at night The breakthrough came from an Arab physicist Alhazen around 1000 AD who noticed that light traveled into the eye and caused it pain He also noticed that we experience afterimages after looking at bright light Light not just our eyes and not the objects themselves was the agent of vision What I wonder as I reflect on these ideas is what was the ancient conception of light It 's mentioned often in the Hebrew bible of course Surely the ancients were sensitive of the action of light around them How they regard it differently if they didn t understand its role in vision ------ Based on material from Vision and Art The Biology of Seeing by Margaret Livingstone Image from Discover Here 's a rare glimpse of official art from North Korea with explanations by B R Myers a contributor to Foreign Policy magazine Kim Jong Il comforts a distraught nation after his father 's death on July 8 1994 In the background is the 66-foot bronze statue of the Great Leader that was erected on Mansu Hill in Pyongyang in 1972 Dark skies in depictions of this period symbolize the growing threat from without The Dear Leader stands guard as the waves of a hostile world crash ineffectually against the rocks Say what you want about the grandiose personality cult and the bizarre geopolitical posturing I 'm intrigued by the paintings themselves That 's some darn good water painting in the second piece especially in the recoil of the foamy wave on the left The strong silhouette and Kim 's resolute defiance remind me of N C Wyeth 's Billy Bones Just swap the spyglass for tinted specs Look at the far red flag in the second painting It sits back in space because of the muted color and the softened top edge All the figures are well studied though the value organization is a little busy The grouping of figures reminds me of 19th century Russian history painters like Vasily Surikov (1848-1916) Official art in east Asia took much of its early inspiration from the Russian painters Back in the late 70s I used to go to Chinatown in L A to collect Mao posters which were impressive paintings on a lot of levels They re a piece of history now I ve had the privilege of meeting many of the artists who painted them and their stories are fascinating See more examples and read political commentary B R Myers on Foreign Policy Thanks Bryn The great color theorist Albert Munsell observed that a given color reaches its greatest chroma at one particular value called the home value or the peak saturation value That peak value varies from color to color An orange-yellow for example is most intense at a very light value while blue is strongest when it is very dark Red reaches maximum chroma at a mi le value The hand-painted chart takes the three hues through all possible degrees of chroma and value Yellow becomes a brown when it darkens and you just can t get a strong chroma from a dark yellow In the chart chroma is meant to be constant along a vertical line while value is constant on a horizontal line It 's good color mixing practice to make these charts and Munsell-schooled artists benefit greatly from the experience For these charts I have arbitrarily limited the chroma range to six steps But in Munsell 's system there can be many more steps and theoretically there 's no upper limit to the measurement of chroma New pigments keep pushing the range farther out This digital chart from David Briggs 's excellent website huevaluechroma shows a range of hues taken through the paces Follow that link to his discussion of the same topic Tom Lopez of ZBS Productions created a full-length audio adaptation of Dinotopia The World Beneath using actors sound effects and music by Tim Clark This excerpt takes you from the pirate 's roost at Black Fish Tavern to the entrance of the luminous caverns It combines the audio track with a slide show shot from the original artwork The pictures start at 0 30 If you want to hear the whole 2 hour plus production ( great for long car trips or studio stints ) you can get a 2 CD set at the Dinotopia Online Store or you can purchase a download at the ZBS website This coming Saturday March 13 I invite you to join me at the Norman Rockwell Museum for an afternoon art program The event is free with admission and will be fun for all ages I ll start at 1 00 with a digital slide presentation that shows what goes into making a realistic picture of an imaginary subject including Dinotopia and other projects Then I ll sign books which will be available at the museum store But you can also bring your old copies too the more tattered the better From about 2 30 to 4 00 we ll draw dinosaurs together I ll do a couple of demonstration drawings and I ll bring a bunch of dinosaur models that we can all work from I ll try to answer whatever questions you have and give pointers to artists of all ages young people just learning to draw and experienced artists with specific questions The Rockwell Museum is always a fun place to hang out and right now they ve got a new exhibit of Rockwell 's fan letters in a ition to Norman Rockwell Behind the Camera More information at the Museum site Admission is free for kids and teens thanks to support from

I went to the Founders College Book Sale today and was lucky enough to find a bunch of cool older mystery books ( and a couple of other books too ) Here 's my take Darker than Amber by John D

MacDonald A Tan and Sandy Silence by John D MacDonald You Live Once by John D MacDonald The Last One Left by John D MacDonald Sleeping Beauty by Ross Macdonald The Book of Bourbon And other Fine American Whiskeys by Gary Regan Archangel by Robert Harris All that for about 8 00 Vaughn Brian K George Jeanty and Joss Whedon Vol 2 No future for you Milwaukie OR Dark Horse 2009 Go ard Drew George Jeanty and Joss Whedon Vol 3 Wolves at the Gate Milwaukie OR Dark Horse 2009 Whedon Joss Karl Moline and Jeph Loeb Vol 4 Time of you life Milwaukie OR Dark Horse 2009 Now this is more like it A little while ago when I reviewed the first volume of the collected Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season 8 series from Dark Horse I was kind of disappointed I felt the story telling was choppy and jumbled and that it lacked a lot of the real character development strengths of the original TV series Well the next three volumes of the series are a huge improvement They are Volume 2 No Future For You volume 3 Wolves at the Gate and volume 4 Time of Your Life The main V2 arc is a Faith story wherein Giles employs Faith to do some Council-type wetwork stuff he wouldn t want to get Buffy involved in It 's a good compelling read getting two somewhat less involved characters in V1 back into the main line of Season 8 V3 Brings Dracula back this time on Buffy 's side battling against some rogue Japanese vampires V4 brings the futuristic Fray back into the mix as Buffy travels into the future V4 also brings Willow back into the main stream of the Season 8 arc Each volume also has a shorter stand-alone story which is basically used for some character development which often gets a bit of short shrift in the main volume arc Over all I am pleased with how the S8 arc is developing -- just like more season arcs developed Slowly during the first part of the season setting up the big push later on And the Twilight Big Bad arc for S8 is still pretty mysterious so I 'm looking forward to seeing how it develops I still have a few quibbles of course and I think the biggest is how a lot of the character stuff if peripheral to the main story arc In the tv series the character development and the story arc were always very tightly bound basically one growing out of the other Buffy and the other characters grew and changed because of what was happening to them and even by S6 what was happening to them became the main story arc In the comic series so far they ve much more tended to seal off the plot from the characterization And I think it 's a mistake We really need to get back into the hearts and minds of the characters by the end of the arc that 's what needs to drive everything else And if it doesn t happen it ll be hard to judge S8 as a success Andrew Fox 's first two novels Fat White Vampire Blues and Bride of the Fat White Vampire were entertaining and over-the-top a couple of innovative entries into the vampire cannon Cinematic and funny touching and absurd they were terrific reads if not quite great literature Now comes The Good Humor Man It 's a lot of the same things as the earlier books obsessed with pop culture very cinematic funny and absurd although not quite as touching and romantic On the other hand it 's also a lot more thought-provoking with a satirical edge that 's a lot more upfront than the earlier work What 's it about Think of it as Fahrenheit 451 for the diet industry Imagine a future USA where high calorie foods are illegal and a gang of government-sponsored thugs will raid any high-cal party they find Imagine if one of the founders of the movement su enly thinks it 's all going too far and that people should really be free to make their own choices in life Furthermore it 's also not hard to imagine that Big Food has come up with a few secrets of it 's own Our newly converted hero then needs to save the day What results is an amazing road trip into the heart of American food culture Fat Elvis Yes Fat Elvis is the driving force ( but not character remember it 's the future ) and inspiration for the book More than that I cannot reveal Anyways it 's all kinda indescribable anyways Liposuction for example is also a strangely important driving force in the novel Read it It 's fun and thoughtful and way OTT In fact every time you think Fox can t possibly go more OTT he pulls another fried peanut butter and banana sandwich out of his hat Seamus Cooper 's The Mall of Cthulhu is a seriously strange and funny book Okay here goes A decade before the main action Ted a regular college kid saves his lesbian best friend Laura from a horde of vampires trying to initiate her into their sorority he 's traumatized by having to massacre the whole nest of vampires ( including a recently turned frat friend ) Ten years later she 's joined the FBI as an analyst while he 's unable to overcome his past and is following her from city to city as her career progresses all the while working a series of McJobs Now he stumbles on a Lovecraftian conspiracy A bunch of white supremacists are working to bring the Great Old Ones back from their dimension Ultimately Ted and Laura work together along with a shadowy yet underfunded government agency to fight them back Light-hearted yet still a bit scary this is a fantastic first novel Good adventure engaging characters some self-deprecating insights into slacker / nerd culture more-or-less tight plotting tons of Lovecraft and other pop culture in-jokes not to mention a whole lot of winking and nudging this is an entertaining melange I certainly hope Cooper will bring Ted and Laura back for more supernatural adventures If the vampire novel is slipping down into the realm of the bodice ripper it seems to me that zombies are the new vampire able to actually embody horror without romance or any kind of soft and fuzzy feelings Zombies mostly evoke fear and terror and a almost fatalistic wonder at the randomness of the universe In the hands of a great up-and-coming horror novelist zombies can be gold Jonathan Maberry is just such a writer the award-winning author of the Ghost Road Blues series of horror novels Patient Zero is another real winner from Maberry if anything even better than his earlier trilogy It 's a combination zombie horror and medical thriller a very good example of the kind of hybrid science fiction horror genre that 's bound to become more and more popular Basically the idea is that a Baltimore cop is recruited by a secretive government agency to help stop what seems to be a Mi le Eastern terrorist plot to flood the world with a plague of zombies that spread quite easily via victims being bitten The action is non-stop the main character Jack Ledger is quite well drawn the plot points are a bit of a stretch but well within thriller limits One of the most interesting aspects is that Ledger 's best friend who also gets drawn into the fight is a therapist who helps cops deal with the stress of their jobs especially when they are forced to shoot someone Throughout the novel he 's talking both Ledger and us through what it means to be a human being caught up in a whirlwind of violence and death helping his friend and the other agents cope with what they re going thought at that basic human level Very interesting and very well done Overall an exciting and surprisingly thoughtful read Highest marks in the summer reading sweepstakes I anxiously await sequels (Y eah I know Zombies and humour Zombies are strangely funny it seems Argh ) Anne Rice Joss Whedon and the makers of the Underworld series of films certainly have a lot to answer for turning the vampire genre from a true subset of the horror genre into a rather lame subset of the romance genre Not that I have any problem with romantic vampires as long as they re part of a larger field of vampire fiction that also includes evil predatory vampires My problem is that the dark supernatural romance seems to be edging out all the rest This brings us to Jeaniene Frost 's Destined for an Early Grave Not normally the kind of book I would read a review copy just happened to land on my desk just as we were leaving for the cottage for a couple of weeks of R R So I took it along I also read it Mind you there were several times in the first 50 pages that I was sorely tempted to hurl it across the room The romance stereotype characters drove me crazy The sexy feisty and tough yet strangely goofy and insecure female lead the tall dark brooding and yet strangely sensitive male lead The tall dark brooding and yet strangely deranged villain Yeah they re all there Buffy Angel and Spike The plot and setting also hit all the highlights in the feudal gothic hit parade Hereditary ruling classes byzantine rules and regulations that you must just die for a heroine with secret powers that happens to be the key to everyone 's plans In the end though I did end up finishing the book as stereotypical as the characters were the plot had enough twists to keep me turning the pages even if the ending was dead predictable Of course it didn t hurt that initially I wasn t quite sure I d brought enough books at the cottage so I more or less felt I had to read it In different circumstances I might not have made it much past page 10 much less 50 or 350 Sort of recommended Barely And speaking of evil vampires I have enjoyed David Wellington 's work and I do look forward to reading the new Guillermo del Toro and Chuck Hogan book The Strain It is out there I just wish the proportions were a bit different Joss Whedon and George Jeanty 's The Long Way Home is the first graphic novel collection of the Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season 8 series from Dark Horse When the Buffy tv show first came out my sons were quite small so my wife and I weren t really a ing any new tv shows to our roster But the show did make a psychic impression because a lot of people I knew were watching it and reported loving it So now that the kids are older and all the seasons are on DVD my wife and I basically gorged ourselves on Buffy watching all seven tv seasons on DVD over about a seven month period -- watching the last couple of seasons in about two weeks each The season-long story arcs made them very a ictive and easy to watch the episodes in bunches Well we finished the apocalyptic Season 7 a few weeks ago and it seemed like a good time to give the comics version Season 8 a try So what do I think So far pretty good but not amazing There 's about a 12 month gap between the end of S7 and the first issue here where some sort of Slayer organization has been set up in Scotland and that whole process is really glossed over very quickly I could have used a bit more of a explanation of what went on with that even if it did slow down the opening action Which actually makes sense of course as the tv show never really worried about using up screen time filling in character relationships and back story bits If anything that 's my big complaint so far with S8 that the characters and their personal stories are really getting short shrift in favour of some rather frenetic and disjointed action It 's understandable that some of the pacing habits of tv would have to change in comics but so far I 'm really missing the characters and their lives and personal stories The overall arc of S8 seems to focus on something called Twilight and I do sort of see where they re going but I 'm really looking forward to getting a better sense of where they re taking the characters in particular some of the minor characters like Dawn who somehow has been transformed into a giant due to a romantic liaison with something called a thricewise whatever that is In fact that would have been a great story in itself As it is it seems to be an excuse to bring back the whiny petulant Dawn of S6 rather than the more mature young woman from S7 -- a step back as far as I 'm concerned Giles as well is more or less missing in action so far too I found the storytelling a bit choppy disjounted and flashbacky an o choice for a book that is presumably aimed quite a bit at comics neophytes drawn in by the Buffy connection Something a lot more linear and straightforward would seem to be better suited especially for the first volume So potential yes I ll be reading the rest of the series for sure but I 'm a little concerned by the first collection that Whedon lost track of what made Buffy such a crossover hit the intervening years between S7 S8 Slaughter Karin Blindsighted New York HarperTorch 2002 389pp Slaughter Karin Beyond reach New York Dell 2008 573pp I don t have too much to say about the two books at hand both by the aptly-named Karin Slaughter Blindsighted is a fairly typical serial killer novel while Beyond Reach is a fairly typical crime thriller Although they don t necessarily have high body counts the violence and mayhem is intense and brutal earning the author both her name and her crime writer stripes Both are well-written and exciting with a common cast of characters which Slaughter carries from book to book in a couple of vaguely overlapping series The plots are clever the pace is breakneck the characters well drawn the action at times shocking and surprising I ve read three of her books ( Triptych last summer ) and I think I ll be reading a whole lot more 
The scenario is again played on a 2 x 2 skirmish board The terrain is all woods with a few o boulders thrown in and small stones used as encounter markers Only Figaro and Manon start on the board ( in the lower right-hand corner ) There is a thick fog shifting and swirling about so visibility is limited to d10 +4 and changes each turn The visibility on each turn is indicated in parentheses at the start of that turn 's description

For a guy that loves a good constitutional debate talk about yummy McCain 's Canal Zone Birth Prompts Queries About Whether That Rules Him Out appears in the New York Times today (T he article is written by Carl Hulse and my father read the article in The Grand Rapids Press and was kind enough to show it to me ) Well read the article but the issue is the US Constitution says you must be a natural-born citizen to be president So since John McCain was born in the Panama Canal Zone the issue is in debate 
A couple of years ago I spent a wonderful week in Tel Aviv helping with the first Oracle BAM implementation in Israel Although everyone I interacted spoke better English than I did the screens and data for the implementation were all in Hebrew meaning the Hebrew alphabet Over the week I learnt to recognize a few Hebrew words enough to enable me to test what we were doing So I knew SOA Suite worked OK with non-English and non-Latin character sets so I was suspicious recently when a customer was having data corruption of non-Latin characters On investigation it turned out that the data received correctly in the SOA Suite but then it was corrupted after being stored in the database

I ve only ever really had like maybe 7 people actually read my story and talk to me about it or mention something about it Other then that Everyone else I gave my story too never once even mentioned it The two girls I worked with back in college always read my stuff and walk talk to me about the chapter My one writing bu y He and I used to exchange stories all the time and help each other out My ex back in college She actually would sit there and read my story next to me and then talk a little about it

If the weather this weekend has been anything like here then you too are enjoying rain I 'm diligently keeping an eye on my extremely religious neighbors backyard for signs the early stages of ark building or animal collecting So far nothing but the usual year-round live nativity The one advantage of Daylight Savings returning over it leaving is the fact that resetting clocks like my alarm clock are easier when all you are doing is moving one hour ahead

I didn t attend this year 's Photo Marketing Association (P MA ) show but as I read the coverage at PCMag and other places a couple of trends were apparent to me The first is a push for mid-size cameras somewhere between point-and-shoot still cameras and the larger traditional single lens reflex cameras (S LR ) the second is a trend toward putting better quality sensors in high-end point-and-shoot cameras even if that means a lower megapixel count In the in-between category of cameras that are smaller than a traditional SLR but still offer things like interchangeable lenses a lot of the interest has been in the Micro Four Thirds segment Olympus and Panasonic are promoting this system which still lets you interchange lens but does not use the mirror of an SLR and thus has a smaller body

I have been using Windows machines for 20 years I worked at Microsoft in 1992 when they launched Windows 3 1 So as you can see I don t come by my decision to switch to a Mac lightly So why did I do it First I have had it with the system crashes that come out of now where And like many people I am drawn to the clean design of the Apple computers And now of course that I have been using the iMac 24 for the past few months I now see what I was often told The software itself ( Leopard ) is more stable and faster than Windows 
The occasion today is to celebrate Hero 's 75th Birthday and we had a family dinner in some traditional Chinese Restaurant in town which my sister recommended Having squeezed in the past during such dinners to much discomfort she decided that this time around we d separate into 2 tables with the siblings and Hero in 1 table the kids and 3 maids in the other table This arrangement made perfect sense because the kids are grown-ed up and its really impossible to squeeze in at the 'm ain tables anymore Food wise we ordered identical fare for both tables

This really was a movie worth seeing For me there are some movies that really take me somewhere and this was one of the movies The scenery and photography is excellent and the soundtrack complements the movies terrificly When you finish the film you feel that you left your own life for a short while and took a lil journey worth taking I am a big fan of action scenes and war scenes ( when they are well-done ) and this movie has that coverred I really enjoyed the fight choreography and how they integrate skill intelligence and strateg yinto the fight scenes creating a realistic vision of the ultimate warrior

So then I 'm a swan flying off into the sky and then the credits pop up I never watch credits because I 'm hardly ever interested in the actor I 'm more interested in the character that they played but Bobbin had an interesting voice actor so I watched the credits to see who voiced him ( a one-hit wonder I guess ) And ka-pow there he is ( I mean Card of course ) right there on the screen Script something or other it was really cool because I was thinking of him before and then there he was like a dream come true or something like that

There is a recent trend sweeping the diamond ring world and this can be a trend that enables newly engaging couples to save a lot of money - as they may need to since they are young and since at the time of this writing the economy has taken a sharp downturn that looks like it will last for a little bit longer - but still be chic and not ever have to worry about any stigma about being cheap

Last May I wrote a two-part series entitled Understanding Apple (P art 1 Part 2 ) In it I pointed out that as someone who has followed the company extensively since 1981 I d developed a pretty strong understanding of the way it had operated over the previous 27 years I ve also spent a lot of time with Apple 's management team over the years developing a pretty good understanding of why the company does what it does 
the city i live in is bisected by a beautiful river i cross it two times every day the otonabee was once a wild river that the first nations used to travel through this region later it drew the early settlers to its side because it provided not only the necessary liquids around which all life inevitably gathers but also because it provided a source of energy energy to drive grainmills and woodmills many cities began their lives this way

No I didn t put those in the wrong order As many people know I have collected every incarnation of Star Trek ever seen on the screen both large and small However there are definitely some I have not had the time to see I decided to correct that and start watching them all I watched the first episode of Enterprise tonight Unlike my recent attempt to go back through the original series I was pleasantly surprised Of course this was the pilot so not everything worked smoothly The actors need to learn their characters a little and definitely need to work on their chemistry But I found the plot engaging and the effects decent I enjoyed watching some more flawed characterization It is logical that humanity had a ways to go from where we are now to where we are by next generation days but I had not seen it on film before 
Blizzard is one of the few companies that has consistently offered Mac versions alongside its PC releases While a beta is ostensibly a chance to stress-test the servers and thus it makes sense to concentrate on the platform with a larger audience some Mac users have felt a bit put out by the long wait The beta is expected to end in late spring making the two month gap for a Mac release a pretty substantial chunk of available time Still Blizzard is committed to making it happen when most developers don t bother with the platform As the old saying goes better late than never

I am writing this post as I am in an Enterprise Architecture class specifically on the Oracle Enterprise Architecture Framework ( OEAF ) I have been a long believer that SOA 's key strength is that it is the first IT approach that blends or unifies business and technology That is a common view and is certainly valid but is not completely true ( or at least accurate ) As my personal view of EA is growing I realize more than ever that doing EA is FAR MORE than creating a reference architecture creating a physical architecture or picking a technology to standardize on Those are parts of the puzzle but not the whole puzzle by any stretch 
As I read about the massive earthquake this morning in Chile and the resulting tsunami my mind raced with prophetic thoughts Then I went to the Word I wound up in I Kings 19 Perhaps it is wise to wait for that Still Small Voice that He will surely send to us if there is more to this or if there is something we need to know That is not to diminish the power of this event or its possible prophetic significance 
ust a quick LOST-related thought I think that most discussions of this season have neglected key insights from last season such as that Widmore and Hawking may both have been acting in order to prevent the death of their son Daniel Faraday As far as Widmore can tell the attempt was unsuccessful And so perhaps he has gone to the island not to kill the smoke monster but to capture him and to make a deal He wants his son restored to life 
There is no place to hide from God- not in the heights of heaven nor in the depths of hell God finds us In the light or in the dark In the open air or in the womb God knows us loves us and helps us- guiding us holding us fast When doctors do not know enough God knows- for He made us Not one cell one molecule- not one atom or subatomic particle-- that makes us who we are is hi en from Him 
Elder Scrolls 4 Oblivion is the best computer / game console game ever known to man I got hooked on the Elder Scrolls Series starting with Morrowind about 3 years ago and still enjoy playing it now Oblivion starts where Morrowing ended but its is a totally different world with different objectives and charaters plus if you get the Game Of The Year Edition you get 2 bonus expansion packs with it You get Knights of the Nine and Shivering Isles

Final Fantasy XIII is finally out on PS3 and Xbox 360 Square-Enix 's newest adventure eschews the visiting towns / talking-to-people / choices focus of the previous games in the series in favor of a new battle and story-heavy system And whether you enjoy it on the PS3 or pretend it doesn t bother you that the Xbox 360 version is terrible you ll have a lot of free time on your hands watching those FMVs and hitting those Auto-Battle commands So while you re waiting why not play a drinking game Take A Shot Every Time You promise yourself the game will get better than this You run straight Someone says the word hero You read the Datalog to understand what the hell just happened You look at the box to make sure it 's actually a Final Fantasy game 
Has literature got a flavour And if it has what does it taste of When I first read Salman Rushdie 's Midnight 's Children I felt the same way I do whenever I have my favourite brand of crisps Kettle Chips I call them grown-ups crisps mature intelligent ( none of that half-full / half-empty pack shenanigans like Walkers ) and a ictive Same with Salman 's fiction It 's full of a silliness that is trascendental and lyrical at the same time He clearly has fun writing ergo I have fun reading him And I have fun too eating Kettle Chips

In my last post http // jahaines blogspot com /2010/03/ performance-tuning-101-what-you-will html I talked about performance tuning queries that appear to be well tuned There are a lot of optimization techniques available unbeknownst to most developers that do not require indexes or radical code changes These are the optimizations that I will be talking about in this post There is absolutely no way I could go over every possible optimization technique available but I will do my best to present as much content here today and will make future posts on other techniques 
The most striking thing about Cozumel right now is the hurricane damage and seeing what 's been repaired and what hasn t Cozumel is actually on a small island just off the coast of Mexico and bore the brunt of last season 's storms At first much of the island looked like old photos of post-war Europe with only the skeletal remains of buildings standing We found as we got closer that there was a great deal of construction going on trying to refurbish these large buildings ( you ll need to click them to full-size )

No other country with a history of successful education applies economic principles of competition and incentives to the teaching profession It 's too narrow-focused There are so many other variables to consider Community family individual differences Schools are not factories No other nation with a successful school system abandons courses in cultural subjects like music and foreign languages to focus only on basic skills and testing

When it comes to choosing diamonds there are many aspects to consider but most gemologists consider the cut as probably the most important feature when it comes to a gemstone 's appearance A diamond can have perfect color and clarity but will suffer in value and appearance due to a poor cut because of its dulled appearance The cut determines a diamond 's brilliance or how light enters the gemstone A diamond with an ideal or excellent cut grade proportions will return the maximum amount of light to the viewer 's eye making the gem appear more brilliant and beautiful as a result

When I was a young boy my Grandmother came to live with us for a while and she loved the soap operas on the radio I can t remember the names of them but there was One Man 's Family but every day she wanted to listen to those This was a prank as a young boy I would set up the phonograph so when she came in to listen instead of the soap operas coming on the theme music for drag net would come on and she wouldn t know how to change it So she would have to come get me and I would change it back

Let me say from the start that I work for Sprint and get free cell phone service If I didn t work for Sprint ( which will be the case very soon ) I might easily make a different choice for a cell phone However I wanted to get a new phone and didn t want something as bulky as a Blackberry or even the Palm Pre Most of my cell phone use is for simply making and receiving calls so I wanted something that was so easy to carry that it was almost like it wasn t there

Harley-Davidson has developed some exciting bikes since they became employee owned teetering on the verge of bankruptcy in the mid-eighties What a turn around for the company from just about out of business to a lean and mean organization that has case studies written about the excellence of its management for use in prestigious business schools 
This winter as we all gathered at my parent 's to decide what excursions ( onshore activities ) we d be signing up for we all decided that today would be the day that we do something as a group with my parents After all they were paying for everything and neither of them were planning on the snorkeling / caving / speedboating activities So we decided to take in a Mexican folklore show and then just kick back and check out the shopping and eating and everything else we might find 
As I sit here late at night I mourn what I have lost I have perhaps mourn what I have lost for too long It seems as life moves forward I keep glancing in the rearview mirror to mourn rather than look forward to what is to come This has crippled my life I have stopped to gaze into where I have been rather than charge forward to where I am going 
After days of rain that dropped 5-8 inches in the Boston area the sun is out the waters are slowly receding and it 's beginning to feel like spring These beautiful crocus blossoms greeted me at my side door this morning as I was leaving for the office - I 'm pleased to share them with you 
Saint Patrick 's Day I totally forgot That is really sad since I am 50 % Irish and almost 50 % Scottish I have no cultural identity I am just a lost soul who has no culture I think maybe the one thing that I inherited from my Irish forefathers is anger problems but that is a different story I didn t wear any green I didn t do anything to celebrate I am surprised I even thought of it at all I guess its because my Mom cooked a Corned Beef and it smelled so Damn good The green tablecloth also helped Otherwise I would have probably gone throughout the entire day without even having a clue 
Toxic people living in toxic environments leave toxic waste Hurting people hurt people In update New York there was a toxic parcel of land called the Love Canal - it is a neighborhood in Niagara Falls where 21 000 tons of industrial waste was buried and built over The original canal project to connect the two sections of the Niagara River in the 1800 's was abandoned 
The Heavy Rain game is more of an interactive movie in which a bloody origami is found near dead people which suggests very interesting paper-y things happened to them to make their Facebook status a frowny face for a long time before they finally died

The other aspect is of course personal but with my wife and I both doing reiki this makes for some interesting dinner conversations I must say that our relationship over the same cycle as my improvements in general mood has also improved I guess a good way to put it is that we feel more kindrid yes that 's it Laughing and doing as we please That 's a good thing 
This first day of school is a little different than the dozens of others I ve experienced Winter 2008 marks the first semester that I start the advertising major at BYU and it feels good to finally have a focus in school Today has been a day mostly of standing in lines for various reasons but I did manage to get some required reading in for my marketing research class So far the text has not lived up to its price ( 153 ) My first class starts in about an hour goes for about 2 5 hours then I have the wonderful commute back to the salt lake valley after that 
I watched the first episode of Enterprise tonight Unlike my recent attempt to go back through the original series I was pleasantly surprised Of course this was the pilot so not everything worked smoothly The actors need to learn their characters a little and definitely need to work on their chemistry But I found the plot engaging and the effects decent I enjoyed watching some more flawed characterization It is logical that humanity had a ways to go from where we are now to where we are by next generation days but I had not seen it on film before 
Last week a friend said to me Are you excited about Vancouver And I looked at him blankly desperately trying to remember when this new movie Vancouver was coming out and what the plot was Don t make my mistake Vancouver is a city in British Columbia British Columbia is a province of Canada Canada is basically part of the United States Just ki ing about the last part

The color and texture of facial skin reveals signs of aging If you look carefully in the mirror you will probably see variations in pigmentation particularly in the cheeks forehead and around the mouth and your skin may have a rough appearance with large pores and a dull finish The Obagi regimen will remove the outer keratin layer of skin ( the layer of dead cells which has not yet fallen off ) and will also blend the pigment in your skin giving you a more uniform color rather than blotchy multiple colors The overall effect is a smoother brighter younger appearance 
There are a few possibilities for this problem The first one is that the little switch that is behind the burner knob either went bad or got water in it To isolate the switch that is the problem you can pull one of the wires off of behind the burner knobs one at a time till it stops That one is the one that is bad 
Men and women who have excess fat deposits and loose skin in their abdomen and who find it difficult to lose the excess fat through pills exercise and dieting opt for abdominoplasty Women who have had multiple pregnancies and stretched abdominal muscles and skin and are unable to return to their original shape can also choose abdominoplasty Women planning to become pregnant should not go for abdominoplasty as the muscles in the abdomen would expand during pregnancy People who have had any type of abdominal surgery should not opt for abdominoplasty 
couldn t believe it when I heard that Naseem soa is teaching kids of all ages at his residence My first thought was how could any parent take their child to him Are we so out of touch with what is right and wrong that we think everything is OK What does it say about us as a society My next thought was why the concerned authorities are allowing this to go forward I hope that their response would not be that there are no laws in place to keep such offenders in check 
This is the best car I ve ever had No probs beyond routine maintenance It 's tall enough to see over traffic and fast enough to zip through it smoothly It 's a bit narrow - can t rest my elbow on the window ledge as I was used to - but I can live with that Mileage is great for a traditional vehicle 23-26 mpg Cargo capacity is remarkable too The back seats can be folded down or removed A neat a ed feature are the hooks in the back for hanging grocery bags 
Software developer VALVE had a couple of major announcements earlier this week the first of which was that there is going to be a sequel to the critically acclaimed Portal released later this year and the second was that the company 's game distribution service Steam as well as many of its games will soon be coming to Macs While the latter may only make a small sect of gamers happy the former should put a smile on the face of anyone that has escaped the Aperture test facility in the past To honor these big announcements this week 's Auctioneer is all about VALVE and the games that they ve brought us 
he wireless industry is a notoriously tough nut to crack and it 's become pretty clear that the first iPhone wasn t about total domination so much as priming the market and making a good first impression with some very dissatisfied cellphone users With the iPhone 3G though Apple 's playing for keeps Not only is this iPhone 's Exchange enterprise support aiming straight for the heart of the business market but the long-awaited 3rd party application support and App Store means it 's no longer just a device but a viable computing platform 
Heard a song today called Unfaithful Not sure who sang it originally but Rhianna does it now It 's about a girl that is unfaithful to her lover Seems like I lived my whole life like that Not a single girl being even the least bit faithful to me They all cheated on me It 's a good song I can actually say I sympathize for the lover in the song cause I went what he went through every single time My niece is starting to show new actions that show her evolution from baby to actual child I watched her today move her car seat to the little table and place her little pooh bear or baby as she calls it into the seat Then she placed a bowl of little gold fish crackers in front of it then walked over and sat down in her own little chair that my father built and started eating from her own bowl She would get up occasionally and take the little wet cloth that we used to clean her face with and use it on the baby to clean its face with 
Let 's face it most of the newest car innovations fit a family about as well as a studio apartment While Ford never says so the innovations designed into the Reflex concept make it look like they were designed with family in mind A hip sporty family that wants to go green but a family There are the reverse butterfly doors which make it easy to get in and out of front or back and mean a parent is no long bumping into the door installing a car seat or buckling baby in And speaking of car seats it comes with one built right into the rear seat When is the last time your car came with one of those 
I survived the day Had a hard time waking this AM but made it somehow Work was interesting had a headache most of the PM wonder if it was Caffeine as I had a coffee this AM and then a Pepsi Had an instant ice pack on neck and shoulder most of afternoon Was told by a couple of people should go home Told them kinda hard with no sick time left and they just looked If they only knew I made 3 out of 4 metrics on Friday and 2 out of 3 for week Pretty sure am off to good start for this week but who knows Better yet who gives a shit really 
This game was a blast You ( as Drake ) start the game waking up in a train that is dangling over the side of a cliff You have to climb up the train car which is slowly teetering off the edge of the cliff ready to plummet miles down into a snowy abyss From the snowy beginning there are flashbacks to what led Drake to this predicament The story unfolds in a very cinematic manner and the scenes in between levels while a bit clichéd by Hollywood standards are still just as good if not better than your average brainless Mel Gibson or Bruce Willis action movie In fact the cheese is part of the fun and I would venture to say it 's intentional 
Stopped by the post office this morning to pick up a package on my way to the lab I thought it would be as good a time as any to clean up my desk and at the very least make it appear that I am more organized than I really am (s eriously it 's a mess ) It 's pretty nice here on the weekends it 's quiet there 's less worry of disturbing undergrad classes if I do any experiments in the daytime Anyway it turns out the t-shirt I ordered from Concrete Rocket arrived Here 's how the design looks 
I had pretty bad vision since I was in 3rd grade About 5 years ago after watching many people around me get Lasik I decided to take the plunge Because this was an elective surgery that in rare cases could cause damage to my eyes I decided to find the absolute best doctor for the job I chose Dr Coleman Kraff and he was amazing to watch Very confident poised fast and focused well like a laser

Ideally the process for buying a laptop would involve a single question :\ Which laptop should I buy The answer would then spring forth from the heavens or your favorite technology Web site Unfortunately finding the right laptop for your budget and needs involves answering not one but a series of questions Fear not laptop buyer we know which questions to ask the answers to those questions along with the current market trends and where laptops are headed 
Slept until 11am Time change seems to have no effect in fact filled my tires with air and went for a bike ride around the complex like 5 times Legs were hurting so stopped and came inside Time change no effect as of yet but being cautious Feeling pretty up and positive Need to get gas for car and then run a few errands Laundry is going to wait again Goal for next week is to complete all of it It is at least in a semi organized piles and ready to be washed Need to find a laundry shop to complete Also need to register for IML volunteer and start working on getting taxes filed and the 5 000 00 medical bill from last hospitalization That is approximate including Doctors which I have yet to receive Funny they are charging me over 3 000 for the CPAP that is the price of a new machine I plan on fighting that charge to see what happens Will be using health advocate to see what if anything can be done Last night did not sleep right away so created contracts for my support system alerting them if what they should be on the look out for and what actions to take if they see me doing those actions 
Yesterday we had dense fog heavy rain last night and fog again this morning It is supposed to transition ( whatever happened to just saying change ) to rain beginning around ten this morning And yes today is the day we load carts onto the Bookmobile unload them reload them unload them reload them -- all day long This will be my first experience dealing with that in the rain I understand that we have some flimsy tarps to put over the carts but the word is that they are not all that helpful At least it is supposed to get up to about 53 (11 6 C ) 
Remarkably inventive animated masterpiece from Hayao Miyazaki who has been responsible for 3 or 4 of the finest animated films I have ever seen and at leas half a dozen excellent ones as well Spirited Away is the best known and it has been dubbed by a well cast group of English speaking actors so that you will not need to read subtitles to enjoy this new classic 
I haven t decided quite what I 'm going to do with them yet I might try a short game using Rattrap 's Broadsword Adventures or else I might try running a solo RPG scenario using one of the old school D D clones probably Labyrinth Lord along with the Mythic GM Emulator which I just recently picked up and which looks fairly interesting Either way I ll most likely post the results here 
To start off this thing is basic when it compares to other portable music players on the market It doesn t have all the thrills and frills that some portables have It doesn t have the video capability it doesn t have touch screen What it lacks in aesthtics it completly makes up for in funtionality ease of use portablilty as well as over all relaibility The size first off always amazes me that something so tiny can hold so much 
I live to bash Al-Farouq Aminu so bash him I will The only chance Wake has of winning this game is if they do it in spite of Aminu The kid is amongst many other things garbage You sit there waiting for him to assert himself until you realize he can t Three words to describe Aminu uncomfortable disconnected and content Similar to how I want you to be aware of my Turner love I also want you to fully understand my Aminu hate I 'm as low on Aminu pause as I am high on Wall 
Yes observers of the Kansas City Rights Voting Rights Massacre know about Mr Hearnes and his work behind the scenes in our sister city St Louis and across the nation The article also talks a great deal about the REAL ID act Missouri State Rep Jim Guest ( R-King City ) is a national leader in opposing Real ID Yet for some reason the anti-REAL ID forces in Jefferson City didn t see the threat of voter ID laws Clearly the governor 's office is aware of the issues Matt Blunt was Secretary of State during the 2004 election His chief of staff Ed Martin was former chairman of the St Louis City Board of Election Commissioners Yet where does the buck stop in the administering of Missouri 's elections The Governor The Secretary of State The County Clerks The Board of Election Commissioners Yes and No Welcome to the Missouri 's segregated election system with anti-machine politics protection Missouri 's system is a result of Jim Crow laws and anti-Pendergast reform efforts Sigh The work of reform is never done 
I was looking for a small inexpensive mp3 player for my workouts at the gym An i-pod seemed a bit too costly for what I would use it for so I checked out mp3 players on eBay After doing my research the Samsung YP T9 J seemed to be the way to go It 's small has multiple features and is much less expensive than an i-Pod I purchased a refurbished 2GB model on eBay for less than 50 4GB models are also available for a bit more I didn t think I would need anymore than 2GB at the time of purchase 
So I have now seen about 9 Enterprise episodes I am actually really enjoying this show It does have a different feel than many of the Star Trek shows I feel the characters are more realistic in their human reactions We have also watched half the first season of Gary Unmarried This is a pretty funny show My wife says except for his life situation I am very much like the main character Apparently sarcasm and a biting wit are how I communicate No argument from me I guess 
I was wondering if any of you follow specific fat burning and muscle building programs If so do you follow programs that you found online or do you follow programs that are sold in stores or shown in magazines or books Where exactly do you get your workouts from if you even follow them that is And what programs have worked the best for you as far as muscle building Also I was wondering what you have tried that has helped you build muscle as far as supplements and programs - as I am trying to compare and test against the best muscle building and fat burning programs 
It was a curious Minister 's Bible Study I held tonight Several of the great poles of opinion came up ( yet without contention ) One of the group said :\ How should we think about these things Healing predestination women in leadership -- and totally different views I sai dMy closest friend in ministry he has since emigrated held the opposite view to me on women in leadership -- and he still does I think that God smiles on him with humour and says I ll show you One of the group interrupted me wagging a finger :\ I ll show you a thing or two I sai dNo I ll show you what wonderful things I can do through you in spite of your quirky views 
for the past few days my brain has been turned off i don t know why it is but i go through spurts where i just turn off maybe it 's my brain 's way of telling me it needs a break my mind is very good at justifying breaks no need to eat healthy ty you just worked out that 's something my brain would say it 's a real bad influence on me as is my heart they are always scheming of ways to make me look like a fool i still like them though

In Mario 3 it 's your job as Mario or his 's upporting role brother Luigi to rescue 7 different and unique kingdoms that are being taking over by the 7 rotten Koppa kids of the original King Bowser from the first game The story still doesn t explain why two Italian plumbers are in this fantasy world but I don t care 
Uh creepy much Family Guy has always been one for the off-kilter comedy but rarely has a series been so cavalier with its sacred canon than last night 's Go Stewie Go Lois cheating on Peter Brian coming onto Stewie in drag Meg being Meg Seth MacFarlane is all over the place Last night saw the first Family Guy since February 's Extra-Large Medium and the break hasn t done any favors for the show All the usual throw-away gags ensue mostly falling flat but occasionally garnering a chuckle or two 
I ve officially decided to wait on the Wii With articles like this one popping up around the internet I think it is worth my while to hold out until at least sometime next year I got the DS right after it came out and then was upset when they put out the DS Lite not long afterward Of course I switched to the sleeker and brighter Lite version but I don t want to have to do that with the Wii 
Throughout the history of Lost long-dead characters have had a tendency to reappear whether through ghostly visions flashbacks and now in its final season flash-sideways In the first handful of new episodes fans were reacquainted with characters such as Charlie Pace and Boone Carlyle and we know that there are going to be other future appearances as well from the likes of Michael Dawson and the enigmatic Libby Now you can a another name to the list Rebecca Mader is returning as Charlotte Lewis

I was told compound exercises are the best exercises for gaining mass so i do the bench press but the problem is when i do the bench press i go on to do the tricep workouts but i dont have enough strength to carry it out i got told that doing bench press alone is not good enough to properly develope your triceps and you have to do specific tricep workouts but i can t because i have been drained by doing the bench press I know the simplest way to resolve this problem is by doing a split rountine but i ve just got back into weightlifting so im doing full body workouts with a divide of the lower and upper sections this is my routine monday upper tuesday lower wednesday rest thursday upper friday lower weekend off do you know anyway to resolve this problem thanks 
30 Rock is a very unique show It 's very easy to see why the Emmys flock to it like tweens to a Taylor Lautner poster there 's simply nothing else like it on TV A show like The Office usually goes out for more obvious discomfort-related gags while 30 Rock engages a much more rapid-fire hit and miss of total absurdity It 's been a few weeks since we ve seen lachrymose Liz Lemon even after the Olympics and I can honestly say I missed the witty offbeat charm 30 Rock does so well 
I disagree with Ruse here because I disagree with Dostoevsky It 's hard to prove a case in fiction and I wasn t convinced by Crime and Punishment where the protagonist Raskolnikov tries to prove his superiority to religious morality by robbing and killing an old woman He botches the job and eventually turns himself in -- just as the police are closing in on him anyway 
It was difficult because every company has cut their budget I tried many job search engines but there is no internship available Then I tried to use some old fashion way mailing resume out to companies which I am interest My respond is only 1 out of 20 and the only respond was I made a following up call It was not cost efficiency soon after few more attempts I drop this idea After all I decided that it wasn t that bad to rely on connection to get a job I went to the student career center and asked the person to help I read a statement somewhere and it said 90 % of your first impression of someone probably is right in the end My guessing is correct that person was not capable of her job because she can t even answer me the result of a survey she asked those just grad student to do few months ago 
purchased this camcorder as a gift for my cousin I am always impressed with Canon 's advanced technology and strong commitment to best quality The picture quality outside in a bright sunny day is amazingly sharp and the Image Stabilization feature works pretty well if you have a shaky hand like me while shooting To shoot a scene indoors in a low light the picture is kind of grainy but still much better than a Panasonic camcorder at the same price range 
Three months ago in June Ji Lee and I went to Bishkek to initiate conversations and creations about public art The art center where we called our home for the 2 weeks ended up with a new identity and a couple of public art projects Now I have returned to maintain the momentum at high CEC generously provided funds for artist initiated public art project Through a call for proposals artists were invited to submit ideas for public artworks which will be installed on the grounds of B Art

I experienced a couple of true Pa y 's Day on the Emerald Isle Basically it went like this The night before one went out got completely rat-arsed sang a couple of pro-IRA songs at the end of the night and found one 's way home On St Patrick 's Day itself one nursed their hangover finally getting out of bed around tea-time then one went out for some more craic pretty much repeating the antics of the previous night The thing was it was just like any leisure-time in Ireland Nobody gave a jot it was St Patrick 's Day You don t need to give the Irish an excuse to drink themselves into oblivion The only people who give a monkey 's about St Patrick 's Day are everybody but the Irish 
Annamalai Temple is an living symbol of ancient Tamil architecture The 11 tiered East Rajagopuram towers to a height of 217 feet while the fortified walls pierced with 4 tower entrances offer a formidable look to this vast temple complex The Pei Gopuram Tirumanjana Gopuram and Ammanaiammal gopuram are the other three The 1000 pillared hall and the temple tank were built by Krishna Deva Rayarar of Vijayanagar

About five years ago I was referred to Dr Richard Reschke for some lower back issues I was having He is a naprapathist which I believe means that he studied the muscular system In any case he is a miracle worker He seemed to know exactly how all the muscles interact with each other and how to massage and manipulate them to give me relief and help me develop preventative stretches and exercises I absolutely swear by Dr Reschke 
A number of years ago I talked some of my friends into participating in an urban adventure race with me The Denver Oyster is a fantastic event lots of fun great atmosphere fantastic camaraderie and I 'm excited to be doing it again this year 
I have had the honor to smell the trash bins first hand Let me ensure you it is a pleasant way to jumpstart one 's morning Yes we should all have the great pleasure in taking out our garbage in the morning like good little tenants trying to stave off small vermin and cockroaches and get hit with a wall of putrid tang nastiness Yes we should all have that pleasure Further I have previously matched the stench of the rubbish bin 's odoriferous emanations to the ones festering behind your own kitchen door Though I am not a creature with specially-honed olfactory cells I ensure you that the special brand of stench you create is unmistakable 
After being in Miami for 90 + years Joe 's Stone Crab opened its second location here in Chicago It has been a favorite for visitors and residents alike ever since Although it is not the quintessential Chicago Steak House for my tastes it is much better Their specialty are the stone crabs They are fantastic and not readily available elsewhere I have had them at least 10 times However recently I have become a big fan of their Alaskan King Crab legs

I think the thing that is really interesting about the old radio programs is that you had to use your imagination a lot You couldn t see what was happening you could only hear it I can still visualize Fibber McGee opening his closet door and everything falling out every show even though I never actually saw it You had to imagine what they were doing and what was going on That is something I missed when it came to television and you didn t have to use your imagination everything was right there for you I guess the other ones I liked there were the mysteries like The Shadow The Whistler and The Green Hornet I enjoyed those too 
From the moment I knew of Ben Stein I knew he had worked for Nixon I also knew he was relatively moderate when it came to economic policy ( in as much as I can say of course many would say that one can t be moderate if one disagrees with them ) He felt that the wealthiest in America were paying a disproportionately lower percentage of their income ( including capital gains ) in taxes 
i am an introspective quiet thoughtful often lost sometimes found conglomeration of people events and expectations filled and unfulfilled who meanders around a relatively small portion of this earth bringing what goodness i can to the time i am given some recognize accept and cherish the somewhat insular sometimes bewildered by it all person that i actually am

Lately I ve been working on a collection of portraits that aim to capture the various personalities that have populated Major League Baseball throughout its history I 'm a diehard Mets fan ( no apologies necessary ) so the characters of the 86 Mets were an obvious jump-off point for me 
A while back I wrote a post that described how trading dreams come true Since that time I ve seen many traders fall short of their goals and I ve seen a good number find success An unusual number of those that succeed do so in part because they find opportunities for mentorship I 'm not talking about the seminars classes and other events that offer education for traders Rather I 'm describing a professional relationship in which a more senior trader models proper trading for a junior trader offers timely feedback to the junior trader and helps the junior trader structure his or her learning process 
Super Mario Bros ( the original Nintendo version ) was the first game I can remember playing to the point of ridiculousness and is an instant classic Super Mario Bros 3 was my absolute favorite game for that console Alas I didnt get a super nintendo so here we are over 10 years later to teh New Super Mario Bros game for the Nintendo Wii WHAT A GAME The 4-player co-op can get confusing and messy but that 's what the Wii system is all about managing multiple players and making video games an interactive experience

When the PS3 was first released I got my hands on an 80G unit as soon as I could Needless to say I was blown away Not only were the games already available for the PS3 phenomenal my old PS2 games also looked much better and played much faster Include the fact that the console also serves as an adequate Blu-Ray player and I was in seventh heaven

Do you think she 's lonely came the question regarding this old care-taker and it was startling to think that such a person of joy could even think to be lonely at such a place near the beach Yet there was something different about Marta she sat in her chair outside the screen door while her cat Princess slowly shuffled her tail back and fourth I quickly learned that this woman would be someone who changed my perspective on dreams We sat with her the morning after while she recounted her story through the decades through hardships struggles sickness and travel and I was startled to hear this Argentine woman declare that she has adopted Venezuela as her new home and her new heritage 
This event is called a race I have no illusions of winning anything besides maybe something in the drawing something that has nothing to do with skill or speed But every event like this that I participate in urban adventure races triathlons running races I refer to as a race It 's not like I have the skill or youth or lifestyle to be able to have a chance of winning so is it appropriate to call it a race I think so because it gives me a chance every time I go out there to challenge myself and to do better than I was able to do before I 'm racing less against the other competitors and more against myself Of course this isn t a new concept most personal trainers who work with ordinary people will say the same thing This adventure race though is going to force me to actually get back in shape It 's a team event and I don t want to be the slow guy on the team ( especially since I ll already be the old guy on the team ) Plus as I have discovered over a few years of doing triathlons that the race is a lot more fun if the whole thing isn t a suffer-fest 
I am an almost-life-long Montanan a baptized Catholic an ardent Atheist a practicing Bu hist a lover of Wisdom I find solitude to be as essential as air though I am at times gregarious and very often joyful alone and with others I laugh at my own jokes love learning and love those who truly love anything I have certainty in little and little time for those who are certain of much though admire those whose certainty leads to service of humankind I have a BA and almost an MA in (W estern ) Philosophy an MA in Bu hist Studies and am working on a Ph D in Bu hist Ethics at the U of London 
The majority of the work on my blog has been digital stuff From here on out no more photoshop posts All traditional I want to test myself if I can commit 
For a consumer who needs 8mm / Hi8 / digial 8 functionality the TRV460 is an obvious choice But for the consumer who is looking to venture into the MiniDV format ( overall smaller camcorder / tape size ) the GR-D33 might be a good stepping stone camcorder The GR-D33 promises to have good video and low light performance so the slight upgrade investment may be worth it Making the transition has its pros and cons the pros being if you own an older Digital8 camcorder with a DV in / out port you have the option of digitally copying your older tapes to the newer format 
We are currently in Year C of the Lectionary but parishes preparing for baptisms at the Easter Vigil have the option of using the readings for Year A for several weeks including March 21 This is because the Year A readings are especially suited to the Rites of Christian Initiation So parishes using Year C readings will find the texts and commentary here while parishes using Year A readings will find their texts and commentary here Bringing children to Mass with you this weekend Hints for helping youngsters prepare to hear the Word can be found here (s orry - Year C lections only ) 
I have just always been a Chevy or Gm kind of guy The worst thing I ever did was trade in the 72 Cutless Supreme SWEET 
I honestly wish I could stop listening to Shakira 's new song She Wolf No I 'm not proud Yes I will keep listening anyway In other news I discovered that I ve managed to go over my 1500 out-of-network texts this month by 50 worth and the month isn t over yet Hmmm Breakfast in the AM with my Calc teacher from high school :) :) :) followed by cleaning out my closet for my mom :( :( :( then Salisbury with Matt and Caroline :) and bonfire at Katie 's :) 
Failed Communities Failed Schools I suppose we should be pleased that Pres Obama found some sort of mojo somewhere ( maybe Hillary told him where to look ) Of course as we might have expected from him and his ofay administration he selected one of the weakest groups to target teachers and schools I d really love to hear him threaten Congress and their handmaiden lobbyists with such gusto He got all pumped for his appearance at the US Chamber of Commerce a group that thrives on bluster He cited the wisdom of the Central Falls Board of Education ( RI ) for their firing of the entire high school faculty and staff He framed his praise thus Our kids get only one chance at an education and we need to get it right I guess the assumption is that everyone knows what right is He had Colin You break it you own it Powell by his side And then there was Obama 's more characteristic mealy-mouthed assertion If a school continues to fail its students year after year after year if it doesn t show some signs of improvement then there 's got to be a sense of accountability Well yes I d say firing a whole faculty shows a sense but not of accountability No the sense of accountability goes way beyond the faculty and even beyond the administration 
So it 's a fantastic day outside A balmy 42 degrees (47 tomorrow ) the sun is shining down its rejuvenating brilliance and I couldn t be more pleased about it It 's nice to just stand in the sunlight close your eyes and tilt your head back a little It feels like I imagine a hug from god would feel Still I can t stay outside all day the dishes won t do themselves after all There are chores to be done and fantasy hockey teams to prep once again now that the Olympics are done I can t help but to look at the news before going to my fantasy teams because I still feel it important to know what is going down on my planet even though the tao teaches mindlessness over mindfulness Or as the ape savior Jesus teaches do not worry about your life what you will eat or drink or about your body what you will wear Look at the birds of the air they do not sow or reap or store away in barns and yet your heavenly Father feeds them Good stuff But I do worry Not so much about me but about all the rest of you humans out there Can t help it Every human alive should have the same right to be left alone that I used to have back when America was still a free country But around the world disasters strike American troops are shooting the hell out of some Afghanis and China is playing a game of chess with the entire planet Checkmate will come when our nation yields world supremacy to them Well unless we Americans nuke the crap out of the planet Then it 's Kobayashi Maru I get mad about this because it didn t have to be this way but greedy men with dreams of riches and lust for power brought have brought this nation to it Both sides are to blame but since 1968 American policy has almost been entirely driven by the Republican party Nowadays those failed policies still haunt and reverberate through the highest levels The current President still follows them Bill Clinton followed them for the most part Jimmy Carter never had an option but to follow them 
They re re-building Banbury Cross or at least one of them there are supposed to have been six original crosses dotted about the town These were vabdalised by Cromwell 's troops during the English civil war as part of their purging of Catholic monuments throughout England and later Wales Cornwall Scotland and of course Ireland There is already a Victorian cross that stands in the mi le of a busy roundabout which no one can get near to but this new one by all appearances will be a monstrosity made from modern materials At a time when money is short for frivalries I can understand why the council has opted not to have the cross built using more traditional techniques but I am deeply resentful that this money has not gone to providing affordable council housing instead of the local housing lotery that they farcicly use in place of providing taxpayers with their deserved security 
So thank God I 'm still in training cause I was scheduled for a shift from 12PM-11PM today and I would ve missed three of my four classes O_O I left Psychology at 6 40PM and drove to work I had the same trainer tonight as I did the first day ( Katherine ) but today we followed a different doctor As soon as walk through those double doors we go to an exam room where a mi le-aged man is complaining about an abscess on his butt Needless to say he removes his pants and there it was Not only is there an abscess but there a massive amount of scar tissue from previous incidents I guess they didn t go as well Yikes It was like the cheeks were abused with a meat tenderizer or something It was graphic and yet that 's not the worst part The doctor unpacked a bandage from the abscess and pulled out a gauze plug the length of let 's say a foot long I was like Oh wow That 's impressive The doctor replies Oh this is shorter than most packs Just imagine the long bloody pus-lined gauze strip coming out of an abscess on the butt-cheek Yep that 's a keeper Then he proceeds to drain the pus out of it Mmm just dandy -D Let 's move on to a lighter note shall we There was a 5-yr old that came in because he has a big boo-boo on da fingor as he had put it Lol I love kids It was actually an infected area where he had gotten a finger prick a couple days before A red blister had swollen up and collected some pus at the head Your body loooves to produce pus when an infection occurs It 's just its way of saying Here 's a lovely reminder that this needs to get checked out -D Anyway the doctor orders a drainage to be done and we retrieve some supplies to do that We also get another assistant to come in and help restrain the child as we do the procedure You know kids screaming and kicking and such Funny thing is the whole thing is going absolutely fine when the kid 's finger is being washed and numbed It 's only when he sees the doctor pull out the needle to prick the head of the abscess in which the kid proceeds to scream at the top of his fucking lungs Literally the puncture takes a fraction of a second and the doctor tells him he 's done Tears were streaming down his face and he immediately shuts up We give him some Neosporin on the finger and a band-aid and a freakin cherry popsicle Yes a cherry popsicle So that was my second night on the job albeit I was really only there for half the shift Lol Only two days have gone by and I ve seen the craziest things and they re only to get crazier Stay tuned readers of interest -D 
In my job I get to take most of the winter off In Austin that means perhaps two months when nothing is growing or falling Now it 's spring and I am having a hard time getting back into it I don t want to work anymore I want to do what I love instead What is work anyway To me it 's doing something for money you wouldn t otherwise be doing I don t believe in that either Alex I think everyone should be paid to do what they most love doing You can t buy enthusiasm So I am looking to make a change I talked to a good friend who said the first thing I should do is print up business cards with just my name and contact information but without saying what it is I do Like Robert Adams I don t believe in work Well maybe not even if it worked for Alex 
I want to thank you god for everything I have I know I 'm not a rich man but I 'm not poor either There 's others who are worse of than I I know when my time comes to leave this world I hope I can lay not in a hospital bed but in my own I won t lay in sadness or fear nor hate as I made peace with those who speak out against me When I grow old and time stands at a halt for those few seconds I will take my last breaths and sing my death song and prepare for a better world As my spirit leaves my fragile body I know you will guide me to a place where I will lay in peace But I know I have a purpose on earth and a given time to do good things for those who need me I 'm not sad nor depress I surrender myself to you lord and ready to fight the good fight and help those who walk into my life I know I 'm your lonely man lord no matter where I go I 'm alone on this earth But Lord you made me your patient man and I will stand the test of time to do what 's right and to be good to others who need me All I ask is a little time to have in this world and to be the man that I was meant to be That 's all I want in life that 's all I ask for 
I 'm getting older every day and I am trying to photograph as many of those days as possible I am Husband to 1 Da yo to 5 Grand (P oppy ) to another 5 (s o far ) I use Nikon Cameras and Lenses but I really believe that anyone can be a great photographer with ANY kind of camera Photography has been great therapy for me throughout my life It has allowed me to get away on my own and with close friends to see the wonders of creation I am trying to record something in photography that will live longer than myself I think it would be really fantastic if my great-great grand-children could see the photos I capture and in effect 's ee through my eyes but for a moment Thank you so much for your kind words of support and encouragement I hope you enjoy what you see and are challenged in new ways to improve your own skills All of your photos help me learn and improve in that same way God bless you all NikonSniper Steve 
Kristen called me with a aditude and said she was coming over and ppicking up her things She came over and was very aggressive with me over petty things and she took her cloths After she had things packed up she reminded me how empty my house will look like when she takes all the furniture away too I just looked at her and said its ok they are just objects Kristen we need to focus on Aleya more then anything She then told me that her mom was heading out of town all next week and if I wanted time with Aleya I could watch her all that week I was very happy about that 
It 's kind of funny how everything in life can alter itself so instantaneously I ve felt so beat-down and broken for the past few days that it 's not even funny and seriously I don t even care anymore Everything that has happened to me recently and everything that will continue to happen to me as a repercussion of those recent events I will endure and overcome I believe that it 's all happened for a reason I 'm stronger and smarter than half of the stupid fucks that surround me and I 'm done dealing with their shit I think the outcome of all of this will prove to be advantageous as long as I look at everything in the right state of mind stray from the negative and do things to better myself rather than give two shits for other people I just can t believe that it 's taken me since July to realize it I no longer need to engross my mind with senseless bullshit brought on by other people I don t want or need a friend that 's going to be over-dramatic and have a blood and thunder attitude all the time Especially if all she / he does is try to make me feel jealousy tries to make me feel like I 'm worthless and tries to make me experience guilt for things that aren t of my own doing or even issues with any sort of validity for that matter I don t need to feel detestable because people don t feel the same way about me anymore whether it be a girlfriend friend or an acquaintance Are you done with me Have you had enough yet Perfect then I 'm fucking finished with you and I realize now that I have been for a while It 's time for me to move on I feel like I need change again I can t handle this cut of situations by the same means and methodology that I used to deal with them depression hostility frustration violence rage It gets really old really fucking fast I 'm done with the conflict I 'm done with the brawling I 'm done with holding myself down with everybody else 's problems Count me the fuck out It 's time I live my life for myself and for nobody else 
I 'm getting carried away That last drawing session last two songs I 'm frustrated with this wireless internet connection and this coffee is terrible I desperately need to get this presentation organized One article down Check out this drawing Nearly 9 o clock I 'm getting cold Creeping on Cougars Let 's cool down this laptop Posted by August at 10 20 PM 0 comments Tomorrow Already These are the last two pictures I wanted to include in yesterday 's post It 's 3am now and I 'm 40 pages away from the finish line in my text book So much for trimming / I guess I 'm pretty well finished with the text book I 'm going to set up a score in Sibelius now I should reviewn the post hoc tests and then jot down all of the formulas I ll be using on the exam repated measures t-test independent measures ANOVA and repeated measures ANOVA The last two sections covered interactions between factors in factorial ANOVAS I have a general idea of what the Tukey 's HSD post hoc test is about there was another post hoc test called Schaffe that was in the text but I 'm not sure we covered it in class and the LSD which we covered in class but isn t in the book I don t remember anything about that one What it all boils down to is ratios Comparing datum grouped by factors looking for systematic difference reducing error caused by random variance That 's pretty well the short and long of it Stats is kinda neat It 's 4am now 
TODAY is a good day now Woke up to a dream screaming two days ago someone close to me said I was yelling like I was being ambushed and attacked I can t remember the dream at the time like everyone else that talks in their sleep once in awhile But hours passed as I awoke from that hell and now days passed and now I feel that that was my own soul breaking back out breaking outa the darkness and understanding what life is really about If we live in the past all we do in the end is waist time and never move forward If we focus on waiting for the other to feel that pain you yourself felt you never feel life again If you focus on your wants and needs too much in the end you never get anything but broken dreams and wasted time If you get blinded by what you lost you will never regain who you really are We are all human we need love and when love fails we NEED to Find it or else be by our selves having no one to be there when we feel lonely if ever again As I break outa my darkness I know NOW that other person is breaking back down into theirs as they fall deeper and deeper into what they did to get a small tad of right ( the wrong way ) they will discover soon that they just outweighed it with wrong I know now I don t have to cause that persion pain to get myself a good feeling in the end I would be no better then them In the end let them do it to themselves and hope that they don t do anything stupid like they told you yourself to do on their last days in your heart I now feel sadness for that persion they will never have the life I will they will always have to work hard to maintain what they did was right we all know that a LIER cant maintain a truth if there is no truth in what they did My life is getting better my life is working out I have my real family and I have people that care as well Living with someone for 8 years and never feeling the feeling I now feel without them has opened my eyes and opened my heart to just let it all fade If any one reads this I hope you learn from it thank you for your time Der Vater von Aleya 
Hello and sorry for the lateness it has been a busy weekend for me Dealing with school life and my personal worries ( not having a boyfriend the people around me hating me and the general OMG IM GONNA DIE ) This last week has been very annoying as I was in a stupor of slight depression all week due to a couple of incidents that really made me mad / upset I won t go into details but suffice it to say it involved homophobic remarks and a huge idiot who thinks himself very important After discussing it with my mom ( I know pathetic but it helped me feel better ) I started thinking about why attitudes like that still persist in our schools at first my anger wouldn t let me think anything accept 's tupid bloody fucking town However after a while it came to me education or lack thereof All through history prejudices have persisted through lack of information about the prejudiced group thing or person It is the same with the ideas and prejudices about homosexuals in my opinion it is all thanks to religion and I don t just mean Christians Catholics and any other church based on those churches I mean other religions like the ones that are practised in the Mi le East most factions of these religions are the ones responsible for the bad attitudes How does this relate to my whole epiphany i talked about well in my opinion these religions didn t base their opinions and attitudes on fact but on ideas that came from their bible or god They didn t take time to realize that were not horrible sinning freaks they got this idea of us in their heads and refused to see that they may have been wrong 
Your probably going to read this someday if not sooner or later probably sooner then I realize I did what I had to do the way I thought it be proper anyhow I 'm sorry if you don t approve of the decision I made Here 's why I chose to say no more to our friendship You need to consider yourself a very lucky woman You have a house a nice car and a good job so you would think things would be okay here I 'm not saying everything ( or everyone ) is perfect But here 's my conflict with you and our friendship Your husband feels as if though he is between a rock and a hard case with the marriage you two are binded in He has taken it upon himself to contact most of the people you talk to to find out about Ricardo Now something is very wrong with your marriage if he feels threatened enough to contact EVERYONE ( this includes me ) to tell Ricardo to stop talking to you Something had to have been going on somewhere to make him feel this way I know this from experience I 'm not saying you are cheating on him Maybe you are and if you are you need to either divorce him Or you need to make the marriage you have right now work Do you have any idea how lucky you are Do you have any idea How much your husband loves you I 'm starting to understand why he is so far from you I don t think it 's all him anymore Maybe it was in the beginning But not anymore All I know is I 'm not going to be an instigator into making him ( or anyone else for that matter ) feel bad I know what my heart tells me about the situation If you have guy friends they need to remain your friends and nothing more I have taken it upon myself to end the friendship so that way you and your husband can make things work out I 'm one less person he will have to worry about and that 's okay He is supposed to come first in your life You two are not boyfriend and girlfriend This isn t the situation in which you two need to put your friends first You two swore at the alter to be there for each other through everything and anything I think news the time to do just that You can call me self-righteous and immoral But if you do so you are only speaking of yourself as well This is what all your friends ( whom re doing wrong with you ) need to do if they care about the life you lead 
Ive been clean from the filth of world and fallen in the grace of God and so far shit has worked out better then I ever thought they will now it 's time to fix me today I thought bout my environment and some people are like lmao Noel you stupid Not dumb stupid but funny stupid and then there 's others that are like you fucking idiot stop fucking up lmao and I began to think and I was like hey why is person number too saying that I FIGURED OUT WHY Lol because hey fuck face Maybe if I enjoyed being as miserable as you are with what 's happening then maybe I would actually want to try harder Now world I don t want you to think it 's directed at a particular person or place but this is something that happens everyday no matter where Iam so it has nothing to do with anyone it 's just a general comment to show that Iam much different then the rest in the sense that my life is directed towards one goal it 's a goal I have to meet and anything that comes in between is just temporary again what that means is that my road to changing the world with film has just began and there 's a high possibility that I may step on a few toes along the way People that know me know that I don t care much towards athority which means I need to be my own boss OR get paid wayyyyyy more Lol anyways look make your dreams come true and know we are all human and make mistakes fuck where you are now you need to get to where you want to be If that means taking a big pay decrease to make it happen then fuck it if you ment to make it in what you want then you will God has a fantastic plan for all of us I know he 's opened my eyes to make me see how possible it is now can you do the same 
I know there are some who think Jamie Oliver is a bit over the edge when it comes to his crusade re obesity I also know that there are those who have both good and not so good things to say about the TED Awards speeches etc Indeed if you are one of the thousands ( millions ) of Tech Crunch followers you probably saw the back and forth over the speech given by shock stand-up comedienne Sarah Silverman Be all that as it may I came upon Jamie Oliver 's speech because someone posted it on Twitter and thought it was something people should check out so I did I would give her credit here as well but I have since lost the message Anyway the reason I make reference to it here is twofold 1 I have a lot of respect for what Oliver is trying to do and the commitment he demonstrates in trying to fight for change that he feels is critical on all sorts of levels With his background and success he could be spending his time and energy on lots of other stuff He has chosen not to 2 I also think that if you take the 18 or so minutes to hear what he has to say that as a result you will come away with some of the same feelings I have expressed above and as a business leader admire the passion he brings to those he hopes to influence to act After all that 's one of the key things leaders hope to do Inspire people to follow Oliver has his way of trying to achieve that and each of us has ours Just watching him in action helped to renew my energy something we all need from time to time No matter what needs renewing in your life maybe Jamie 's passion will help do that for you as well 
After a great weekend spent with old high school friends and our return to church Sunday it definitely made today very depressing No matter how old I get I always keep wishing the weekends will never end Maybe it was the perfect family day we all shared yesterday planting our spring flowers ending that got me in this funk Or maybe being unemployed now for 2 and half months is really starting to take its toll on me However I still applied for a position with USPS this morning but who knows where that will go I was also thinking about going back to school but still undecided So basically my day consisted of spacing out and not really spending anytime with Alora That will be different tomorrow I promise I was so out of it I didn t even workout today that really screws up my weekly schedule trust me Holly arrived home around 3pm and was obviously in a funk like me because we butted heads almost immediately She ended up going to the store to cool off while I took my cellphone apart Stupid fight really so making up when she returned was easy I ended up firing up the BBQ and cooked us a really good dinner The family 's sleeping already as I write this and I 'm finishing up the Lakers game So I guess today didn t turn out to bad now that I think of it Should get up early tomorrow and head over to the Vitamin Shoppe for some needed supplements Maybe I will make it up to Alora and take the dog and her to the park Lakers win 
OK I have had enough of typing the answer to the gay or straight question When I 'm asked this every day maybe 10 times per day The answer is I am LOVE I love all beings I do not mean Bi sexual either My sexual preference is Women BI Loving The evolved being capable of loving caring and hugging for all humans In this day and age if you are still Homophobic you are way behind in evolution The Gay culture runs the world They run fashion entertainment and many of the top businesses which make the world turn Ask somebody I go out The Gay clubs every now and then because the energy of the music and the people is very Happy very pleasant I love Gay people Some of my closest and best friends are Gay and lesbian and I value them dearly (S ara Halford and Rico Hernandez ) They are My Family practically So when I 'm asked If I 'm straight or gay I will refer all to this blog to fully explain why I don t wish to be in the ignorant straight category But then I 'm not Gay either Like I said I AM LOVE I choose to love all human beings under God and hang out and work in Happy loving environments Partying at the gay club is fun The music is great The girls come in and feel free to dance without being harassed And a friendly note to all those who are Homophobic I bet all the clothes you have in your Closet were designed and made by a Gay man think about it Don t bite the hand that clothes you 
Anyway no I 'm not considering a career in acting or any of the above I was pondering princess for a while but I worry that the idea might cast aspersions on my sexuality if nothing else along with all the responsibility etc Too much hassle No I ve found myself actually enjoying a piece of coursework me and a coursemate of mine have been working on for the last term It 's a Flash application a website designed for promoting a game which is in our case fictional I ve gotten really into it so much so that all my other projects have been on the backburner while I focus on this one A dangerous thing to happen but I really can t help it I ve spent the last 2-3 weeks designing menus buttons banners flashy images messing around with animation really keen to get our site looking great and exciting to toy with Everything makes a fun little sound when clicked explosions fly on-screen to background music I love it And it 's becoming more second-nature how do do things with Flash too the further we progress 
Cell phones have allowed us a tremendous amount of freedom We can talk to our friends wherever we may be make dinner plans chat with our relatives and yell at our cable provider from any place in the world They have freed us from the bondage of land lines and the tyranny of the corded telephone But there is something cell phones have not been able to free us from And that is the wrong number phone call I got my first cell phone in college I was actually studying in Italy and it was more for emergency purposes than anything else Nobody except a couple of friends back home and my parents knew I had one I didn t really get many wrong numbers And if I did they were in Italian and I couldn t understand them anyway When I got back to the states I got my first brand spanking new cell American cell phone with what I thought was a pretty random Arizona cell phone number Little did I know that number was 1 digit off from the Sunburst Resort People would call me and the conversation would go like this Hello Hi I d like to make a reservation What I d like to make a reservation for the 26 through the 30th of next month Um What Is this the Sunburst resort Oh No 
I cannot believe that this weather is so stable at this time of the year It never even reached freezing last night The furnace is still going strong on the same load and this is day 3 since I loaded it It looks like the driveway is thawed out and dry already and this is only the mi le of March If this keeps up the deer will be out of the yards and will start heading North where they will be sitting ducks for the first blizzard of the year You can bet that we still have another month of Winter coming and it is way too early to start spring chores This is not good news it just portends a long and bad fire season The boss is off to Minnesota for a couple of days to take her niece to school and will probably do a little shopping in the Mall of America with her Sister-in-Law Becky I will be on my own with just the dogs for company This is an opportunity for me to get started on some outside chores if I can get the body in gear after sitting on my rear end for the last couple of months I can almost walk on bare ground all of the way out to the apple trees and now is the time to do some pruning before they start growing again I should get a fresh can of pruning paint as I don t remember if I used all of what I had or not I think I will also put in some fertilizer stakes to encourage new growth instead of more apples I really want to change out the blower for the front loader just to force Mother Nature to dump more snow on us but then I would have to pay someone else to put the blower back on as that requires too much lifting for me to handle Without the loader I can t really do much cleanup from the winter as there is going to be a lot of lifting involved and I need to empty the trailer of the sugar beets before they start to ferment There are enough of them left over this year that the deer are going to have a real hangover if they try to pig out on them I just have to make sure that I get them far enough away from the house that the Brown dog will leave them alone I don t know what she would be like if she got into a bunch of fermented beets and I don t want to know either Just the thought of her drunk on beets is enough to give me a headache I guess that I had better make myself a list of what I want to accomplish this summer although I know that is just a dream I can at least pretend to be productive First I have to allow time to watch the sun come up while enjoy a hot cup of coffee on the swing Later

During the span of the last two days I met with over 200 companies and most of them said they had a really great show After attending the furniture show two weeks ago and this fashion show this week I can t help but get the sense that business conditions are slowly but steadily improving There were a lot of smiling company owners at both shows Things are look n up Unfortunately covering so much ground and talking with so many companies my camera didn t come out of my pocket nearly enough However this next photo just had to be taken 
Everyone who actually goes to the shows for the music anymore is close to being as bad as the scientists because everyone is either a 'm osher or a dancer ( HxC dancing I E throwing down ) If your a mosher everyone outside the said group is a faggot or a pussy and hear such things as You don t f *** ing know real music and Quit dancing like a fairy and push someone pussy And the same can be said for the dancers You have no idea what the meaning behind hardcore is and you dumb mosher fags you look so stupid 
for all you girls out there who say the men are the worst part of your relationships that men are dogs screw you too i 'm living proof that no matter how nice or how mean you are to a woman they will always find a way to make you feel like a second rate citizen The women in today 's society are the real problem they re only out to satisfy their vagina and they ve had people like Oprah Ellen Rosie and a host of other single name powerful females tell them it 's okay to do so It seems that as soon as a man cheats on a woman he 's an asshole but if a woman cheats on a man she 's Liberated and Free Fuck That if i cheat on a woman it 's because the current one i ve got is useless in the sack If i cheat on her she 's not staying around much longer IF a woman cheats on me it 's because i 'm an emotional brick and wont talk to her she ll keep that going as long as she can get the emotional connect from some tiny dicked tad pole and come home to get fucked silly Women of this generation are too empowered or so they think and they have no idea what to do with all this perceived power 
So I think I may have finally decided what I d like to actually do for a living in the now-not-so-distant-future I ve never really known as other people seem to I mean everyone as a kid dreams of being say a football player a racing driver an astronaut a princess ( ) or a ludicrously good-looking actor / famous guy I d only be qualified for the last one really But then I 'm not so great at acting as a recent great idea for a personal media project has proven But those things are just silly kid things no-one in their right mind ever believes that such ideas will ever actually come to fruition right I certainly never did anyway In fact I d never really even given thought to what I d be doing when I was older I was always content to get the heck on with my English homework Those kinds of careers you kind of have to be born into or get into by sheer accident Malcolm Gladwell might disagree with his success = sheer dint of hard work and effort theory but at the end of the day that 's going to be the case 95 % of the time 
You never know the person that you see on the street You never know the person that is behind or before you in the line at the grocery store You never know what the person has gone through or what they re going through right now Sometimes You never even know what 's going on in your life I 'm taking steps The steps maybe small but eventually they will get me a heckuva lot further then I am now I 'm taking steps I never want to feel comfortable where I am for if I were that way I would not be in the Geographical State that I 'm in I 'm taking steps To reach out and meet new people Sometimes You never even know where your life would be if you didn t take that extra step So take a step and see what happens ( I dare ya ) 
so i havent posted anything in a couple of days not because i ve been too busy or too pre-occupied but because there 's been nothing worth commenting on lately the last few days have been very run of the mill and i guess that 's a good thing No emotional ups or downs nothing stupid at work nothing crazy at home My little minions at work are doing what their told my big house is empty now and the emptiness brings quiet i like the quiet i ve got a million stories to tell stories of painting bridges for tuition money tales of tragic environmental pollution caused at the hands of yours truly One day i ll tel you about the time i beat the shit out of the guy who was fucking my fiance he was still in my house AND naked that 's one for the ages there are the nights on the road playing in night clubs smaller than my living room then fucking every vag in the place There are days that bring the evil stench of the bottom feeders of society to the surface just for a glimpse of what real life is like only to push them back to the recesses of society 's mind hoping to forget about them yeah i ve taken some writers liberties with some of my stories already that 's what i do i 'm a self centered ego star I feel i am larger than life so i make my stories larger than life as you read these remember that i will probably not go down in history as the greatest storyteller in history but i will go down on your little sister and probably your wife Look out guys i 'm cumming on what 's yours 
Well it 's that time again Time for me to come up with another excuse as to why I have nothing to show you all This week it is simply that I have been too busy with work ( as in trying to make money while unemployed ) and research The research here is actually more important than that of simply drawing and animating which is why I have not finished anything this week I have paid the DAVE school ( that 's Digital Animation Visual Effects School for those who haven t heard ) down in Orlando Florida a little visit Upon checking into our hotel room we called one of the DAVE school representatives who happens to also be a 3rd block student I ll go into blocks a little more later He was kind enough to pick us up drive us around town a little give us a tour of the school and answer some of our questions DAVE school is located on the back side of Universal Studios Orlando on the premises It is not inside the gate to the back of the park but it is on their back lot While they are on Universal 's property they are not owned by Universal but have a good relationship with them Students get employee-like passes to let them into the back side of the park where they can go on rides enjoy the shows or even eat in the staff cafeteria which I am told has VERY reasonable prices Fun aside the school is currently in a sound stage which they converted for teaching classes Despite this it is decently equipped with a mocap ( motion capture ) studio green screen small theater and dozens of work stations The front room is the entry where their receptionist can help with anything you need Next to this is the guest lounge where they show off all the movies posters toys et al that they have made They also have an impressive collection of student awards on display 
In a way this line-up parallels the one in that featured Shannon Ana-Lucia and Libby Both Shannon and Nikki were self-motivated sexpots whose deaths were probably not widely grieved by viewers Both Libby and Charlotte were brainy but mysterious women whose su en deaths gave reason for their dorky male admirers to grieve And both Ana-Lucia and Ilana are hard-hitting women who use violence to enforce their authority Seeing as how Ilana is the only one on the list still breathing she 's not exactly in the best of company Let 's hope she fares better than her season two analogue 
Hi this is Fred Hi can I have towels please What Can you transfer me to towels please You have the wrong number This isn t Bed Bath and Beyond No you idiot face I 'm playing a prank on you You know us folk in the be ing department always screwing with the guys in towels What the hell do you think Did they think my dad misheard them Oh TOWELS I thought you said trowels and I was thinking to myself man we don t sell any shovels You d think the wrong number would result in more hilarity and less anger and frustration People always end the calls so abruptly As though I am going to keep them on the phone just to make fun of them Like my friend Julie who got a call from some guy freshman year looking to rectify problems with his girlfriend Julie was not his girlfriend but after hanging up and trying to call his actual girlfriend only to get her voicemail he called Julie back to ask for his advice Perhaps he was a womanizer of wrong misdials perhaps he liked the sound of her voice We all found it quite strange that he called her back for relationship advice Perhaps he didn t have any friends of his own Maybe he really needed a ( very ) impartial third party to help solve his problem Maybe he was really in a bind This must have been the thing because he called her back a third time to ask some follow up questions And Julie bless her heart stayed on to chat with him to humor him and engage in a story She really commits to the fun And it was her thought process that I channeled recently when I had a similar scenario pop up in my own life 
And not just for porn Somehow I ve either got a nasty nasty infection or a hellacious mold allergy Either one is possible I woke up this morning feeling like death warmed over No alarm - just a vast vat of uck to bring me to I have classes to teach Ugh Blackboard to the rescue Thanks to the power of the internet and telecommuting I was able to teach my classes over chat rather than hauling my carcass in to infect the world Rather than limiting the discussion hosting class over chat liberates it Rather than getting disrupted by giggles and snores we re able to focus on content rather than setting I 'm definitely going to incorporate this fully into my classes next semester 
The volume of marketing content might not be the problem For a lot of entrepreneurs the problem is that they need to do more effective online marketing The de facto practice has been to generate cheap keyword-rich articles and hope that drives traffic to their site but that 's as far as they ve considered If a prospect clicks through to the website there is no clear next step for them to take Instead the business owner simply hopes that the prospect will call or follow or subscribe 
A friend of mine bought a puppy It ran around with the kind of wet nosed furry coated and playful disposition that is really quite endearing So of course ( like a sucker ) I said yes when he approached me with the opportunity of selling the little guy He couldn t rightly keep him locked up alone in his house while he was gone all day And frankly I was looking for a friend who was good at listening and not so good at talking Some of the training him not to poop in my house was a bit of pain but we ve long since left those things in the past ( well at least I hope so ) However my furry friend has developed a bit of a desire to explore Lately he 's been heading over to the neighbors which where I live is a bit of a distance He has all the room in the world out here I don t mind if he 's out exploring several miles away ( he knows where home is ) But I 'm just not that crazy about him bothering the neighbors Although their little daughter loves him to death and begins chanting his name when he 's around Today I decided to give the ok for my friend to tie a couple of tin cans to his tail And of course as soon as the deed was done he took off running He ran around their yard some (sp ooked their cattle a little ) and then hid somewhere By the time I decided to come and call for him he was yelping as if someone had hit him and he dove into my truck ready to get home Panting and all excited he just sat there and looked at me with eyes that spoke of a hard day 
chucky 's hindsight They say time creates a man into a being full of knowledge and wisdom or stuff him full of shit and more shit that being said I like to think as I approach 34 years of age (12/06) that I am now a man being filled with knowledge and wisdom Though I have no problem admitting that I was once full of shit ( lol ) and blame my ignorant ideologies at the time on my fallacious past ways Now I just write letters articles and books - and do enjoy meeting new people from all over the United States and the entire world Meeting new people gives me a valuable lesson on life and its principles that go unnoticed more than not My life journey at present and my hope is that I can encourage the youth of today - to whom society has rendered neglect upon - and steer them straight - into a land of equal opportunity based on legal activity hard work and a keen mind Education is power Knowledge is wealth I want the youth of all the trailer parks projects slums and shelters to know that going to school will pay off in the long run You can make it with diligence self-perseverance and a prayer to God to whom all things become a reality I want to use my current situational debacle to prove that crime does not pay The temporal high isn t worth one 's entire life Education is the real 'm eal ticket Charles chucky mamou /2008 
That would be Sadie the chinchilla So adorable and soooo soft She was a little ball of crazy energy Sunday morning Robb and I planned to go to church so we got up at 8 30 realized it was actually 9 30 and went back to bed I hate rushing to get ready in the morning It puts me in a bad mood So I just decided we would skip church entirely Well we slept until 11 45 I hadn t slept well in almost a week so it was a nice change And then I rushed to get ready for my writer 's group which was having a special meeting I drew this confused cat bird sort of a way for me to sort out my feelings about a friend of mine who is newly transgendered It 's really hard to stop calling him Ian and start calling her Elaine and the pronouns oh the pronouns I ll get it right one day So after a full day Robb and I ordered pizza I hadn t eaten all day so we finished the whole thing That night I had the happiest dream ever I got a pygmy hippo as a pet and he LOVED cat food and potatoes So freaking adorable I could spit And this morning 
I appreciate you stopping by to sample a bit of my world behind the camera I have been very blessed to have had the opportunity to travel and see many great things During those travels I took many common photos of a far away land that opened my eyes to the common things we see everyday here in the midwestern USA I decided that these local common things were very worthy of my photographic attention I have deliberately sought to pay more attention to my surroundings Many call that 's topping to smell the roses I have found that to be good therapy This website records many strange events or happenings It explores wild abstract color and different ways to view things I have always enjoyed intense contrast in photography To me color splashed everywhere is great sometimes even enjoyable pushed to the bizarre with manipulation programs Interested in having something photographed Send your inquiries to nikonsniperguy aol com I just might hop in the car and get it done Thanks for coming I enjoy your comments and hearing how a photo strikes you All the best 
Another reason in my opinion is that beginning in the fifties many people started to confuse Homosexuals with Pedophiles People not only got the gays are sinners 'm essage but also the eww you disgusting perverts 'm essage It also didn t help that Homosexuality was listed as a mental health disorder ( they thought it was a defect in the brain like schizophrenia or Bi polar ) till like sometime in the nineties so up until the mi le of the 1990s we had all these arrogant idiots telling people to hate us And the cause of it all LACK OF EDUCATION It seems like such a simple thing right Guess not because people still refuse to educate themselves about homosexuality before forming an opinion Now granted things are a lot better in Canada we can marry there are numerous programs in the city where we can get help counselling and hang out with others like us pride celebrations are in most cities now a days and most peoples attitudes are better than they used to be It 's just that the people whose attitudes haven t changed that is keeping us back from achieving a better life for gays everywhere The only thing it would take is education in the schools about homosexuals and homosexuality and I think that slowly attitudes would change Also an absolute no nonsense policy on homophobic remarks and bullying Now if I haven t completely bored you and your still reading I hope u have enjoyed my rantings 
I could have used that quote last week for blogophilia but I was unable to comply I ve written over the years of the stupidity of my customers This one I think has to take it all ya know I ve said it before I thought I ve seen it all but NOPE I unexpectedly had to work 14 1 /2 hours the other day and thus being the graveyard shift the lobby wasn t open A guy from da Hood came to the window and bought a cigarillo a lighter and payed for his gasoline So I 'm watching him He 's pumping gas and lights up the fricken cigar Over the intercom I told him put it out or I ll stop the pump He put it out stupid moron I 'm pretty much back to almost 40 hours a week ( I 'm a happy camper ) But to get the five days in I need to work at another store the clientelle are totally different then da HOOD peeps It 's in an industrial area and the majority of the customers are business people Nice friendly just want to get their stuff and git outta dodge Back at the regular place I have people constantly ask me do you sell milk And I answer ummm yes it 's where the sign says COW Maybe this little blog ll get my creative juices flowing my Muse divorced me the past couple of weeks so maybe I ll have to court her and make nicey nicey cuz I really don t like not writing oh plus my camera crapped out again so it 's cell phone pics until I get it fixed I was smart enough to buy Insurance this time will just take a couple of days to get it back So I think the two best Dumb Awards in Da Hood should go to the chick that gave me half a dollar bill and asked if that was worth 50 cents and actually MEANT it and then the dumba that lit up while pumping gas Got any better one 's then that Requirin minds wanna know 
My friend Jasyn recently posted this on my last blog first time I had seen it and I love it now I wanted to share it with you Whoever put this together did a great job I ve watched 2 other videos in the series and this one is the best in my opinion I was excited to show it to my oldest son who is 4 and loves both science and music and he really liked it We got to go over who each of the people were what they studied had accomplished and what they were saying He has wanted to be an astronaut since before he could talk and has always loved science He was most amazed that the guy said that scientists love not knowing Don t scientists know everything he asked No I replie dand that is why they are scientists My favorite quote was by Neil deGrasse Tyson :\ When you are scientifically literate the world looks very different to you and that understanding empowers you So empower yourself Study Learn Question Repeat My son told me the other day Dad I 'm a scientist AND an expert AND his voice got real soft for emphasis a real ninja Expert ninja scientists however is another topic for another blog Don t want to blow your mind here or anything Peace Mark J A 
I try to work hard - enough to keep my wife Bria at home so she can take the best care of our two kids Rhys and Ammie I love my job Seriously I like to help people with what I can I enjoy good discussions great jokes well-written scripts in movies with good acting and directing I have a great appreciation for the little things that make me smile cold beer pizza lasagne sunshine summer anything non-winter shiny power tools green forests fishing camping good loud music people who are honest and loyal The One Real God ( not the sadly perverted gospel of convenience you hear about in so many churches these days ) and basically anything having to do with meat and melted cheese together in a steamy mouth-watering au-pair My wife has a much more commercially successful blog Because I rarely post and she frequently does I ve decided to stop crowding the internet with my use of valuable space here and nest my bitter rants and biting sattire within her quaint and uplifting Wordpress site 
About a month ago or so I went on trek to Sinhagar fort near Pune I was so excited about the trek ( as usual ) because I had heard so much about the place But I couldn t make it to the fort in last five years Well in retrospect I must say that it was good that I didn t go visit the place WHY Okay Let me be sure that you are asking me why I think so Please have a look at the following pictures But at the same time I am ashamed to share these pictures with you all Shivaji Maharaj a name every Indian feels proud to be associated with one of the most clever emperors in Indian history had never thought of this kind of treatment to his picture that too in his own territory Well I don t want to exaggerate it any further Just have a look and let me know your opinion about it 
Last night Sofia and I saw The Lightning Thief at midnight For those who don t know this movie is based on the book of the same name about a character named Percy Jackson who learns that he is a demigod half human half Greek god Sofia has loved the series of books for nearly five years If you remember back to my blog last summer I waited in line for two hours to get the author 's autograph since Sofia was in Costa Rica She 's crazy for the books So it was only fitting that we go see the movie as soon as any non-theater employee / industry insider possibly could Sofia didn t have school Friday but I did So I purposefully fell asleep when I lay down with Bella and Alex and then woke up around 10 30 to get ready to go Sofia also took a bit of a nap We dressed drove to the theater got our popcorn and drinks and found the perfect seat The showing wasn t a sell-out but it was pretty full So now for those interested I present my review of The Lightning Thief I 'm always sensitive to spoilers so when I get into spoiler territory I ll change the color to almost match the background If you don t want to read it just skip it But if you want to read them click and drag your mouse across them and read them while they re highlighted I haven t read a single review of the film yet so I want to get my two cents posted before I check out what the critics are saying I ve read all the books so my opinion will obviously be flavored with that perspective but I 'm not one of those people who hates when movies change the storyline or details I know adapting a book to a movie is a bit of an art form in and of itself I 'm cool with that as long as it 's done well 
The Wind In The Willows is one of my favourite children 's books but i always felt that Kenneth Grahame failed to give us sufficient closure Sure Mr Toad escaped prison and won back Toad Hall but what was his life like after the experience of prison Well Mr Toad may i just say that you ve impressed us very much in the interview stage and i think you ll be hearing from us very soon oh that 's fantastic thank you We ve just got to ask you a few standard questions Sure go ahead have you got any previous criminal convictions ummmm i do actually but it was a long time ago and i can promise you that i ve changed ok what was the conviction for umm well it 's convictionS actually One was for stealing a car after which i proceeded to shout stuff at people while speeding past ( Mr Toad has a real compulsion to always tell the truth since he found God )\ ok well that shouldn t and i killed a man Yeah Mr Toad killed a man years before the grand theft auto incident Well by man he means shrew because in this sick world that Kenneth Grahame created where moles converse with badgers a man 's life is worth the same as a shrews 
Not only did i get up first today but i actually drove the car too I 'm not as against driving as i used to be - i wouldn t say i enjoy it but i 'm happy enough to do it The main reason for me not having driven up till today is two fold - firstly i ve not driven this particular car ( we are in Sally 's company Ford Focus ) and secondly i am better at navigating so Sally would rather we sat on our usual sides of the car Because we were going to places that we knew fairly well today i offered to drive and my offer was taken up We had some rain overnight - not too much but enough to dampen everywhere and it was still trying to drizzle as we set off for Bamburgh this time to check out the town itself Well i guess that village would be a better description as it is very small indeed There is a RNLI gift shop with museum a couple of gift shops tea rooms pubs and hotels and that 's about your lot We selected the Copper Kettle tea room and entered the old wooden beamed cottage and stepped back in time Although the building has been there for centuries ( originally built to house labourers for the castle ) it has only been a tea room for about half a century Two spinster sisters bought the property and spent a fortune on turning it into the tea room (T he last page of the menu gives a potted history ) They bought the building for 8000 but spent 13 000 on the wooden panelling inside alone Just like our holiday to Wales last June it was only on the last day that we found a cream tea We each had one of their wonderful cream teas with two lovely warm scones jam whipped cream and a large pot of tea between us It was heavenly 
Work progress on little Winslow I was thinking about yesterdays post and my comment of doing something more NY I think this painting captures some of what I was doing while in NY and the chair figures more into what I ve been doing in OR It 's not a good thing or a bad thing it 's just what 's happening in my work Back in NY I doubt I would have thought to include the chair here in OR I struggled to leave any of the background out I think because I ve been painting so many environmental portraits in the past few years it 's how I 'm seeing the world I also love the feel of Don 's studio where the picture was taken Winslow is so much more than Don 's studio companion and to paint him set in the studio leaves out part of the story Painting him with only the chair makes the viewer wonder more about Winslow the dog than Winslow the studio dog Plus people will wonder What is that chair doing in this painting 
So I still come around here once in a while I read a blog or two I rarely leave comments anymore It 's because I am real busy and self-important dontchya know I have just been swimming in busy ness Treading may be more accurate OK swimming sounds like I 'm going somewhere Treading might not be progressive but still sounds athletic I guess bobbing in busy ness would be more apt My job has taken over my life Don t get me wrong I love my job Egotistically I even sometimes think I 'm kinda good at it I didn t acknowledge it ( I think I realized it a while ago ) until tonight I read Misha 's blog about her daughter and her sense of wonderment It made me smile I remember some of the conversations that I have had with Misha and some of the blogs those conversations birthed I look back and compared to now my life was shit We talked about bridges and love and Terebithia and I wrote about Hank and Phil and HER and kicking dirt with my bare feet and about boobs and poop and such I guess I post blogs when I need the catharsis of producing a gigantic mass of emotion turmoil angst wonderment joy anger and the like I felt that urge tonight then the kids started fighting and all that I could produce was a proverbial wet fart Today as I said life is busy and from other 's expectations good There are the daily grind headaches And no time for the heartaches I kinda miss the heartaches and the wonderment that they brought This made no sense whatsoever Anyway have a good night The headaches come early when they start at 530 Later Deaner 
I didn t really have a good title to my post so I decided to massacre the title of one of my favorite Star Wars books As you may have noticed it has been more than a month since my last post I had some intentions of updating my blog shortly after I returned from school but I have not gotten around to it until today The last month of school did indeed go well I gave all my reports and took all my tests I got pretty good grades on the stuff that I did and now I am glad that I have to do no more of said assignments until the end of August This past month I have been reading and playing video games Pretty good summer so far I know in your mind you are saying What this bum hasn t yet gotten a job To that I say I 'm too pretty to work Well actually as y all might have noticed the job market is not extremely good right now There is very little work in Pahrump and even were a position to open up it 's tough because I know that there are a number of guys and gals in the church who need jobs to support families If anything opens up I ll probably let you know but until then it 's helping out in the new building at the church and reading books 
I ve written before about how I 'm now at the age where I ve become part of an obvious targeted demographic when it comes to television commercials and advertisements Being in my mid-40 's I am in prime shape to be taken in by ads that promise everything from being able to re-grow hair to being able to be ready for up to 36 hours should I choose to become intimate with someone 
Now that 's how to play up and at em without breaking players legs If Pulis watched the Chelsea-Inter game tonight he should have taken notes Inter were all over Chelsea from the off They wanted the game so much more than Chelsea and the hard work paid off Chelsea played as if they expected to be gifted a dramatic late winner and Drogba got all stroppy when it didn t happen Fantastic Yes Inter 's tactics at defending corners were far from savoury but they got away with it and it made me laugh to see John Terry kicking off for no apparent reason other than that his team had lost at the final whistle Haha-de-ha That aside I was bored throughout The first leg was dull enough and there were 3 goals mixed in there Tonight Inter 's defence were solid once again and Mourinho admitted to celebrating wildly with his players in the dressing room Fair enough Ancelotti said before the game that he d have a glass of wine with Mourinho post-match Quite whether that will happen remains to be seen but I can t imagine Ancelotti will want to talk football if they do After Eto o scored Inter 's winner ( a goal that won me over 60- cheers Samuel ) the camera cut to Ancelotti and you could almost see the lemon juice trickling down his chin
